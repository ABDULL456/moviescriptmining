{"test1_input": "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels \nBy Guy Ritchie \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT \nThis whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, tapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright  pair of eyes. One is bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their clarity. \nEDDY Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one. So you want to play? \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. \nFADE IN: \nWhat have you got? \nWe cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good hand. A flush beats my pair. What about you? \n* Cut from completed film. \nAnother pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards: a run is revealed. \nAnd here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all hustlers! \nWe cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You got some real money? \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. \nFADE IN: \nEd scoops up a large pile of money. \nOdds chaps, you gotta remember the odds. \nThere ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman who has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players are also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with embarrassment. \nSERG I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward? \nEDDY I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can feel a case of the flu coming on and . . . \nSERG (interrupts) All right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need to know what's going on, son. \nEDDY If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded. \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS. \nWe pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in the inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK STOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We wait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then see one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS joins the sentence.] \nEXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY \nWe open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery on a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming volume at which he is advertising his wares. \nBACON See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny- by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you here today I would make more money with me measuring tape. \nA well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd waving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it. \nEDDY Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you say? I'll have five. \nCertainly sir. I'll just wrap. \nChanging his attention. \nBACON Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that. \n", "test1_true": "Buy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been paid for. \nThis really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first enthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first pretended. \nEDDY Bacon! \nBacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms between Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal there is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done this before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze. \nBACON (voice-over) Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz. \nEDDY (voice-over) The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on. \nWe cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance. \nINT. GROCER'S SHOP - MORNING \nEDDY arrives at a grocer's shop. We meet Tom. Tom is talking to Nick the Greek. \nTOM What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal. \nNICK Of course you are. All right, Ed. \nEDDY Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating? \nTom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression. \nTOM Please, both join me in my orifice. \nINT. GROCER'S SHOP STORE ROOM - DAY \nThey work their way past a maze of boxes. \nNICK (fingering and admiring one of the boxes) How much did you say it was, Tom? \nTOM You know how much it is, Nick. \nNICK And that does include the amp? \nTOM You know it doesn't include the amp. \nINT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON \nTom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen. This is obviously a smart and serious establishment. They stop in front of the man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head chef. Meet Soap. \nTOM What have you come as? \nSOAP Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's. \nTOM If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money? \nSOAP Get your fingers out of my soup! \nSLOW MOTION \nSoap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting. \nTOM (voice-over) Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal. \nBACON (voice-over) He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it.

The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with gun) prepares to do his worst. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nThere is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a large black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as both gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the machine gun to explore further. \nPLANK (under his breath) What the fuck is going on here? \nDog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use them. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.' \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nWe see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY \nDog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than aware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then checks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit. \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nBig Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks straight into him. \nBIG CHRIS Got something here for me, have ya? (Dog is stunned by this) Come on, chop chop. \nBefore Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much. \nOn reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on the back seat. \nCount that son, and put your seatbelt on. \nINT. SCOUSERS' CAR - DAY \nDEAN Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nEd's place has been shot to pieces. Only Rory and Winston (in shock) seem to be left. Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his van, then he kicks over one of the bodies. It's a blood-covered Plank. \nRORY BREAKER This is one of them. \nWinston nods in confirmation. \nLucky, that. \nBang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and Plank despatch each other simultaneously. \nINT. ED'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nTom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving. 126 \nTOM There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them? \nSOAP Six. \nTOM How many wings have they got between them? \nSOAP Twelve. \nTOM How many feet? \nSOAP Er, well, twelve. \n", "test2_true": "SOAP How the fuck should I know? \nTOM How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?] \nThe end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them, dangerously close. The lads lodge a complaint and then they stop outside Ed and Bacon's so that they can pick up the money. \n* Cut from completed film. \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nBACON What has been going on here? \nThey look into a smoking, blood-covered house. \nSOAP The money, the gear! \nTOM That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses. \nSOAP OK, don't panic; let's think about this. \nEDDY Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am panicking and I am off mate. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY \nBig Chris is about to walk in to Hatchet's office. The door opens and out walks John O'Driscoll with a serious sunburn. \nBIG CHRIS Hello, John. Nice holiday? \nJOHN O'DRISCOLL I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny. \nBIG CHRIS I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John. \nHATCHET (off) That you, Chris? \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHATCHET How did you get your hands on these? \nHe drops a vagina-shaped penis massager, realising that these are the guns he has been after. He then tries desperately to conceal his excitement. \nBIG CHRIS The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them? \nHATCHET Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em. \nBARRY Was it any trouble getting the money? \nBIG CHRIS Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters. \nHATCHET Have you counted the money? \nBIG CHRIS Yeah, it's all there, to the pound. \nHATCHET They were going to pay, then? \nBIG CHRIS It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there. \nHATCHET Good job, Chris. \nChris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet. Harry is ecstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself. \nEXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 259, "test3_input": "Big Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and starts the car. \nDOG What are you doing? \nBIG CHRIS Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive. \nDOG You had better be careful. \nBig Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife. Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle. BANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen. \nINT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nAnother time lapse. \nSOAP Well, what's going on? \nEDDY I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear. \nBang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash goes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked unconscious. \nINT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY \nBig Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing so. \nBIG CHRIS Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to me as you have. \nDog is being thrown around like a rag doll. \nINT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE \nWe are looking through a two-way mirror. \nSERG Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need to know what's going on, Edward. \nEDDY If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded. \nThe camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a policeman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he shakes his head. \nTRAFFIC WARDEN No, that's not one of them. \nThe policeman then knocks on the door. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nThe SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on his own. After a short pause the door bursts open. \nSERG All right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here. \nFADE IN TO BLACK. \nFADE IN. \nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT \nAll the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is interested in whatever he has to say. \nEDDY The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us. \nBACON Apart from those shotguns. \nEDDY And Tom took care of them. \nPause while Tom looks embarrassed about something. \n", "test3_true": "Ed looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed. \nTOM I wanted to talk to you about that. \nBACON Well, talk. \nTOM Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him. \nBACON \nYou dippy bastard. \nEDDY The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside? \nTOM We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they? \nSOAP I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid. \nEDDY Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge. \nBACON And, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP \nNow, Tom! There is a pause. \nALTOGETHER Now, Tom! \nTom leaves, looking a little sulky. \nEDDY The silly sod. \nBig Chris walks in. He approaches the bar. \nBIG CHRIS JD. \nJD Chris. (Pause) You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you? \nBIG CHRIS Nope. \nJD Can I help? \nBIG CHRIS I think I can help you, as it happens. \nJD Yes? \nBIG CHRIS I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually. \nJD Well, I suggest you speak to him, then. \nThey all look rather shocked. He is carrying their bag and he places it on the table, which increases the shock factor. \nBIG CHRIS It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have cost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have decided to bring your bag back. \nPause. The words you are looking for start with thank you. \nEDDY Thank you. \nBIG CHRIS Now you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any more. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be waving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last little visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been emotional. \nBig Chris turns to walk out. The lads stare at the bag and then at each other. \nEXT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 260}

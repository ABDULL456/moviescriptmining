KELVIN What are you talking about? 
RHEYA That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different. 
He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory. 
KELVIN Who have you been talking to? 
RHEYA (no reason to lie) Sartorius. 
KELVIN When?  When I'm asleep? 
She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes must have taken. 
KELVIN I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are. 
RHEYA I'm just trying to understand what's going on. 
A beat. 
RHEYA How have you lived the last ten years?  Did you love anyone? 
A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head. 
RHEYA Did you think about me? 
Another beat.  He nods.  Then: 
RHEYA But we fought. 
KELVIN Yes.  Especially toward the end. 
RHEYA Why did she do it? 
KELVIN You... she said I didn't love her. 
RHEYA Was she right? 
KELVIN No.  I love you. 
RHEYA (reflexive, but genuine) I love you, too. 
If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the feeling won't last. 
KELVIN Can you sleep? 
RHEYA I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me. 
KELVIN Those are dreams. 
She falls asleep.

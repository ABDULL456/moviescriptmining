BURGEMEISTER And now for our next act we have something really big. 
Suddenly, SCREAMS in the crowd. 
The audience turns and sees THE GIANT TURTLE - marching through town, crushing everything in its path. 
BURGEMEISTER (panicked gasp) 
Burgemeister flees, leaving Elsa to her own devices. He rushes through to the back of the stage. 
EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
Running franticly, Burgemeister tries to save himself. He nearly crashes into the Gym Teacher, busy fleeing the Wererat. 
BURGEMEISTER *Gasp* 
GYM TEACHER *Screams* No get away. 
Desperate for a place to hide, Burgemeister spots a porta- potty and quickly ducks inside. 
INT. PUBLIC RESTROOM - NIGHT 
Burgemeister can hear the pandemonium escalating but, feeling safe for the moment, sits on the toilet and breathes a sigh of relief. 
Strangely he feels something sharp poke him in the butt. When he jumps up he sees a host of sea monkeys, jumping out of the toilet! The door to the porta-potty bursts open and Mr Burgemeister is trampled, as the sea monkeys head towards the center of town. 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT 
The gym teacher races past some destructed stalls being chased by a Wererat. She swiftly climbs up a pole were the Wererat can not follow her. 
The sea monkeys are everywhere. They even emerge from a man hole and chase Bob's Mom through the stalls. 
Victor's Mom and Dad try to battle off the approaching sea monkeys but there are too many of them. Mom grabs Dad by the arm and pulls him into a nearby phone booth.

MOM This way! In here. 
They slam the door just as a sea monkey flies into it and slides down the glass. 
DAD Whoa! 
Suddenly another sea monkey smashes into the glass followed by another and then another. Mom and Dad are surrounded. Just as it appears they are going to be overwhelmed - 
THE TURTLE MONSTER arrives. 
His huge hand bears down on the phone box ripping it from the ground. Mom and Dad make their move and run to find safety as the turtle monster chomps down on the phone box and the sea monkeys scurry off. 
EDGE OF THE SQUARE 
Victor, Toshiaki and Bob arrive at the town square. They see the turtle monster in the centre of town. There are Sea Monkeys everywhere. 
WIPE TO: 
Nassor, drunk with power, commands the Mummy Hamster to take on the turtle monster and show him who is mightier. 
NASSOR Go Colossus! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! 
The Mummy Hamster gets ready to attack, when, in one large step, the Turtle Monster's giant foot lands directly on the Mummy Hamster and squashes him flat.

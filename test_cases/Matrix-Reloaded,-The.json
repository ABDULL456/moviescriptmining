I... forgot his name.\" \nNEO \n\"What happened to him?\" \nTRINITY is sullen. \n\"He didn\u0092t make it.\" \nNEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up, awakening. \nNEO \n\"Was he like me?\" \nTRINITY nods. \nTRINITY \n\"Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo.\" \n\"Aren't you tired?\" \nNEO \n\"No. I've never been a big sleeper.\" \nTRINITY \n\"I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days.\" \nHe turns to her, questions in his eyes. \nNEO \n\"How many 'ones' have there been?\" \nTRINITY \n\"That's not the point.\" \nNEO may not think so. \nTRINITY \n\"You are him. You\u0092re mine.\" \nNEO \n\"But what does it mean, to be The One?\" \nTRINITY \n\"I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you.\" \nNEO \n\"So, now what?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Now, Zion will give us a new mission.\" \nThe hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in. \nMORPHEUS \n\"We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes.\" \nHE closes the hatch and disappears. \nNEO \n\"Does he ever knock?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Not on his ship.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAIN DECK, NEB \nThe crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to a rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank   unlocks the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   the tarmac with a resounding smash. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. ZION TARMAC \nThe tarmac  is a  busy, crowded  military airport,  with hovercraft of different  sizes  spread  across  the  lot.  Its  housed  poorly  lit, houses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site.  Crewpersons run around,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.  Munitions  are  carted across the tarmac on   robot rolling racks. No  one  pays the NEB  and its battered crew any mind. \nNearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM  are parked. Their engines shut  down, and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out. \nNIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but their  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barely contain their grins. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Niobe...\" \nSHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down. \n\"M.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Thanks for the rescue.\" \nTHEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps between them. \nIt's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier. Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face. \nCHOI \n\"Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even know!\" \nNIOBE smiles at Morpheus and fades back as BOOTH shouts his own praises. Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer. \nCHOI \n\"So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?\" \nDUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking offscreen. \nDUJOUR \n\"Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello, Morpheus.\" \nCHOI \n\"Huh?\" \nHe looks at what she's seeing. His gaze halts on NEO. He's concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take, and his jaw drops open. \nNEO \n\"You?\" \nCHOI is quick to resume his cool. \nCHOI \n\"In the flesh, so to speak.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"Welcome to the real world, Neo. I'm glad you're here.\" \nCHOI \n\"What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?\" \nDUJOUR \n\"Definitely.\" \nCHOI \n\"Morpheus?\" \nMORPHEUS turns from Niobe and  a Zion officer. He addresses  Trinity, glancing at the others. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Go on ship's liberty. Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk or sober.\" \nEXT. ZION STREET \nIt's like a  valley floor running  between two gigantic  walls of rock that are  nearly vertical,  coming together  in an  elongated archway. Carved into the street level  are innumerable stores and shops,  above them,  apartments and  balconies that  rise to  the top  of the  arch. People  flow  through the  street.  Their clothes  are  homespun wool, denim, and leather. Dyes and  color are absent. Carved into  the solid granite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are intricate and beautiful carvings. \nNEO is lead down  the street by CHOI,  DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and  a few other rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity melting into one race. \nCHOI \n\"See, man? This is home. This is the main street. One of \u0091em, anyway. Almost everyone is a fighter. Sometimes, even the kids. \nTHEY pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small machines. \nCHOI \n\"Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. Check it out, here are some newcomers.\" \nA group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them. They look at NEO, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer. \nNEO \n", "test1_id": 975, "test2_input": "MORPHEUS arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part. He stands  and grins down at NEO. \nMORPHEUS \n\"So, you can smack me around, Neo?\" \nNEO \n\"Oh yeah. Anytime.\" \nMORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into  the booth. He stands before them. \nTRINITY \n\"How\u0092s Tank?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"He\u0092s on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son she\u0092s lost in this war.\" \nHis comments set a sober tone. \nMORPHEUS \n\"The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But, that\u0092s not giving us a rest.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Let me guess. We\u0092ve been ordered back out anyway.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Yes. This is another special op. I\u0092m in command, Niobe and Trinity are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon.\" \nFLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch. \nMORPHEUS \n\"We don\u0092t know exactly what he\u0092s capable of. He may be just tapping his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from him, as he does from us.\" \nCHOI \n\"Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You\u0092ve been assigned to this mission because you\u0092re the best, Choi.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents to death.\" \nCHOI \n\"Oh my God that\u0092s so funny. My point is, don\u0092t we need some r-and-r? Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five, right? Shit. I\u0092m glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus...\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You don\u0092t have to go, Choi. Volunteers only.\" \nTRINITY \n\"He\u0092s got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our entry. And Neo\u0092s.\" \nCHOI \n\"Fuck. Every fucking time we get another \u0091one,\u0092 this is what they do.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"He is the One.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"You haven\u0092t lost the faith, have you Choi?\" \nCHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down. \nCHOI \n\"Well, these are the times that try men\u0092s souls. Here\u0092s to victory.\" \nEXT. TUNNEL \nThe FREEDOM hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises through  the murky  depths. It  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the cave. \nA quartet of  SQUIDDIES slips by.  We follow as  they worm their  ways through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble cockpit by mere feet. \nFREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi  at the controls. \nINT. FREEDOM COCKPIT \nThey watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance. \n", "test2_true": "\"Power up. Sleep mode.\" \nCHOI \n\"Aye aye, capitano.\" \nMINIMAL cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark. \nINT. MAIN DECK \nThe ship\u0092s OPERATOR, a lean Asian  kid with a gaze like a  laser scan, sits behind  NEO, who\u0092s  sitting at  the operator\u0092s  console with  his hands on the abbreviated keyboard. Trinity sits with them, her feet up as she observes. \nNEO  stares  at  the  screen. It\u0092s  a  huge  syllabus  of Matrix  code characters. He struggles to learn the complex code. \nNEO \n\"Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine, right? \nRAZOR nods. \nRAZOR \n\"You catch on quick, man.\" \nNEO \n\"I know these symbols from the hacking trainer. But how come it\u0092s so hard to find them on the keyboard?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Your brain knows what to do. But it has to associate characters with your body.\" \nRAZOR \n\"It\u0092s muscle memory, Neo. Think of the space bar and your thumbs nail it. Because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. But think about reverse \u0091ka,\u0092 and your fingers don\u0092t hit automatically hit the reverse key and the \u0091ka\u0092 key in one shot.\" \nNEO \n\"Where did these symbols come from, anyway?\" \nRAZOR \n\"Most of it is from the old Japanese. It\u0092s Katakana. See, the machines aren\u0092t binary. No zero and one. They\u0092re quantum-based, so instead of an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all numbers between zero and one.\" \nNEO \n\"All numbers between zero and one. That could be an infinite number of numbers.\" \nRAZOR \n\"Not could be, it is.\" \nNEO is astounded. \nNEO \n\"Holy shit. How many calculations per second?\" \nRAZOR \n\"How many CPS? Well, that\u0092s kind of hard to estimate. Put it this way: picture all the particles in the known universe. Not just atoms, but sub-atomic particles that compose atoms.\" \nNEO \n\"OK. At last count that was what, a gazillion, right? Two gazillion?\" \nRAZOR barely smiles at the joke. \nRAZOR \n\"Well, it\u0092s up there. In any case, the number of calculations per second the Matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of particles in the known universe.\" \nNEO \n\"Woah.\" \nTRINITY \n\"That\u0092s how they have the operating power to create entire worlds within their PCs.\" \nNEO \n\"OK. That\u0092s why it looks like reality. They have the computing power to create entire worlds.\" \nRAZOR \n\"Right.\" \nNEO \n\"So, if we hack into the Matrix, why can\u0092t we just change the code while we\u0092re at it?\" \nRAZOR \n\"No, no. See, it\u0092s not that simple. The machines, the programs that code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the agents, they are code. There are different types of agents, many work unseen with no interaction in the matrix. Then, there are the enforcers, the ones we know all too well.\" \nNEO \n", "test2_id": 976, "test3_input": "\"Where is Neo?\" \nCIRCA \n\"Haven\u0092t heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of the Matrix.\" \nMORPHEUS appears enraged. He looks at Neo, supine on his chair. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Why does it still exist? Why hasn\u0092t he destroyed it yet?\" \nRAZOR \n\"Maybe he can\u0092t.\" \nTRINITY is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like hell. \nTRINITY \n\"Is he even alive? Is he captured?\" \nRAZOR \n\"Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Haven\u0092t locked onto him since.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"What? Why not?\" \nCIRCA \n\"Call me crazy, but I think he\u0092s masking his own displacement signature.\" \nRAZOR \n\"His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back and forth.\" \nMORPHEUS  stares at  the data  on the  screens. The  Matrix lives.  He pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an incredible rate. It\u0092s obvious Morpheus can handle computers. \nMORPHEUS \n\"I found him once. I\u0092ll find him again.\" \nWe  go deeper  into the  miasma of  green symbols,  swallowed by  the blackness of the screen, and emerge into: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nThe apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a leather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off. He absentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers. Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter. \nHolding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as though it was a disk of bubble  gum. He folds it again, then rools  it as though it\u0092s a musket ball. \nChandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. She reaches points the remote at the TV, but Gregory puts his hand over it to  get her attention. \nGREGORY \n\"So, you really don\u0092t have any idea how you got here?\" \nCHANDRA \n\"No. I only remember being on the bike.\" \nGREGORY sighs. \nGREGORY \n\"Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we got this place?\" \nShe looks at him, annoyed. \nCHANDRA \n\"Duh. We broke in. We don\u0092t own a penthouse.\" \nGREGORY \n\"What if I said we did?\" \nCHANDRA \n\"I\u0092d say you\u0092re insane.\" \nShe finally gets the remote and changes the channel. The volume  comes on, louder and  infinitely more tinny  and obnoxious than  anything in life. Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space. \nINT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nNEO sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring  ahead. He\u0092s  in the  belfry of  an ancient,  destroyed cathedral,  among the pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap. \nFROM here, in  downtown, we can  see the modern,  uptown section, with its  gleaming  skyscrapers. METACORTEX  still  stands, illuminated  by searchlights. \nNEO sits and broods. Isolated, his world turned upside down and  right side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank. \nAgain, he tries his cell phone.  Static. He collapses it and puts  it. Just as it leaves his mind, it rings. The face flips open. \nNEO puts it to his ear without speaking. \nMORPHEUS (O.S.) \n", "test3_true": "NEO\u0092S grim expression is melted by relief. \nNEO \n\"Morpheus! Holy shit!

He stands and surveys NEO. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix exists.\" \nEXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nNEO\u0092S relief fades into confusion. \nNEO \n\"I know. I\u0092m sorry.\" \nMORPHEUS (O.S.) \n\"And the problem is...\" \nNEO \n\"Uh, it\u0092s impossible. If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within the system will die. They will all die. There has to be a different way.\" \nMORPHEUS doesn\u0092t respond. \nNEO \n\"Morpheus? Did you know this?\" \nWe  hear  nothing. NEO  can  hear his  own  heart beating.  Anger  and confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries. \nMORPHEUS (O.S.) \n\"I didn\u0092t say things would be easy, Neo.\" \nNEO sinks to the ground, shocked. He shakes his head. \nNEO \n\"No.\" \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nMORPHEUS isn\u0092t happy about what he has to tell his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but  there is no bending his will.

We have to get the people out.\" \nMORPHEUS (O.S.) \n\"Even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their defenses, there\u0092s no way we can rehabilitate billions of people. They wouldn\u0092t even want to be woken up.\" \nNeo is silent. \nMORPHEUS (O.S.) \n\"You can do it. You can free us.\" \nNEO \n\"Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?\" \nMORPHEUS is silent for a long while. \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nEveryone is watching  Morpheus, and no  one can quite  believe what is happening. \nMORPHEUS \n\"You know what needs to be done. Time is short. Make up your mind. The only way you\u0092re getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction.\" \nMorpheus kills the connection. \n", "test3_id": 977}

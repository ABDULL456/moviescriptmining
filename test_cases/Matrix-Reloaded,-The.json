{"train": "T H E   M A T R I X   R E L O A D E D \nWritten by Andy and Larry Wachowski \nApril 8, 1999 \nFADE IN ON: \nDark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. We hear  wind as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere. \nWe DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity from the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as we approach the fissure. \nWOMAN (V.O.) \n\"Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em.\" \nMAN (V.O.) \n\"I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!\" \nWe hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police scanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora. \nNIOBE (V.O.) \n\"Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'\" \nMAN (V.O.) \n\"Oooh, our savior. He\u0092d better be worth it.\" \nNIOBE (V.O.) \n\"Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!\" \nThe azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight convoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the first and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables, is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward, slowing as they reach the top of the arc. \nNIOBE (V.O.) \n\"Woo-hoooh!\" \nThe rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flails wildly between them. \nMAN (V.O.) \n\"They're still on us!\" \nMore vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours up onto the surface. \nINT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT \nThe NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing backwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them. \nIt's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEO\u0092S POWERS   and the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their knocked-out ship. \nMORPHEUS is on a headset. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Niobe, they\u0092re closing.\" \nNIOBE \n\"How many?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred.\" \nINT. SEPHORA COCKPIT \nNIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship with her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as they streak over the dark surface. \nNIOBE \n\"You\u0092ve got a gift for understatement.\" \nINT. FREEDOM COCKPIT \nTHE  FREEDOM\u0092S CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying blind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBE\u0092S ship. \nHis lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen. As she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT tattoo is conspicuous. \nThey switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass. \nMAN \n\"Oh shit, we\u0092re screwed. We gotta set down and EMP \u0091em.\" \nNIOBE (V.O.) \n\"Too many!\" \nEXT. FREEDOM HULL \nA racing SQUIDDIES  reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its cutting laser and ripping into the hull. \nINT. SEPHORA COCKPIT \nNEO \n\"Who is this guy?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Who?\" \nNEO points to the mystery man. \nTRINITY \n\"That was... I... forgot his name.\" \nNEO \n\"What happened to him?\" \nTRINITY is sullen. \n\"He didn\u0092t make it.\" \nNEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up, awakening. \nNEO \n\"Was he like me?\" \nTRINITY nods. \nTRINITY \n\"Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo.\" \n\"Aren't you tired?\" \nNEO \n\"No. I've never been a big sleeper.\" \nTRINITY \n\"I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days.\" \nHe turns to her, questions in his eyes. \nNEO \n\"How many 'ones' have there been?\" \nTRINITY \n\"That's not the point.\" \nNEO may not think so. \nTRINITY \n\"You are him. You\u0092re mine.\" \nNEO \n\"But what does it mean, to be The One?\" \nTRINITY \n\"I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you.\" \nNEO \n\"So, now what?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Now, Zion will give us a new mission.\" \nThe hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in. \nMORPHEUS \n\"We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes.\" \nHE closes the hatch and disappears. \nNEO \n\"Does he ever knock?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Not on his ship.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAIN DECK, NEB \nThe crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to a rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank   unlocks the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   the tarmac with a resounding smash. \n\"Where did they come from?\" \nCHOI \n\"Energy plant we raided on our last mission. There were some survivors.\" \nNEO \n\"How are their minds freed from the Matrix?\" \nTRINITY \n\"With difficulty.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"If at all.\" \nThey step into a club, Dead  Duck. It\u0092s a sailor joint. Lots  of wood, beer on tap, and rum. Crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels, greeting them, as they eye Neo.  They take a booth in the  corner. The waitress arrives. \nWAITRESS \n\"Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First day back?\" \nCHOI \n\"Yes, lovely.\" \nWAITRESS \n\"On the house, then. Four rums?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Make it eight.\" \nThe waitress smirks and leaves. TRINITY turns to CHOI. \nTRINITY \n\"Any casualties?\" \nCHOI lights up and takes a drag. \nCHOI \n\"Two. Sidewinder and Left-right.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"I can\u0092t believe Cypher turned. Bastard.\" \nCHOI \n\"He who loses faith...\" \nDUJOUR \n\"Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you really gain enlightenment?\" \nNEO shrugs. \nNEO \n\"All I know is I kicked Smith\u0092s ass.\" \nCHOI \n\"Fuckin\u0092 finally, Jesus Christ. It\u0092s about time we iced that bastard.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"Yeah, we finally won against an agent?\" \nCHOI \n\"I guess 1 \u0091n 298 isn\u0092t a bed record, huh?\" \nThe drinks arrive. Tall glasses of rum. \nCHOI holds his glass aloft. They raise their glasses to toast. \nCHOI \n\"Live free or die.\" \nALL (save NEO) \n\"Live free.\" \nThey slam the rum back, and  slam empty glasses on the table.  NEO can barely manage to sip his. \nNEO \n\"God, how do you do that?\" \nTRINITY \nMORPHEUS arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part. He stands  and grins down at NEO. \nMORPHEUS \n\"So, you can smack me around, Neo?\" \nNEO \n\"Oh yeah. Anytime.\" \nMORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into  the booth. He stands before them. \nTRINITY \n\"How\u0092s Tank?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"He\u0092s on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son she\u0092s lost in this war.\" \nHis comments set a sober tone. \nMORPHEUS \n\"The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But, that\u0092s not giving us a rest.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Let me guess. We\u0092ve been ordered back out anyway.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Yes. This is another special op. I\u0092m in command, Niobe and Trinity are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon.\" \nFLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch. \nMORPHEUS \n\"We don\u0092t know exactly what he\u0092s capable of. He may be just tapping his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from him, as he does from us.\" \nCHOI \n\"Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You\u0092ve been assigned to this mission because you\u0092re the best, Choi.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents to death.\" \nCHOI \n\"Oh my God that\u0092s so funny. My point is, don\u0092t we need some r-and-r? Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five, right? Shit. I\u0092m glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus...\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You don\u0092t have to go, Choi. Volunteers only.\" \nTRINITY \n\"He\u0092s got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our entry. And Neo\u0092s.\" \nCHOI \n\"Fuck. Every fucking time we get another \u0091one,\u0092 this is what they do.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"He is the One.\" \nDUJOUR \n\"You haven\u0092t lost the faith, have you Choi?\" \nCHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down. \nCHOI \n\"Well, these are the times that try men\u0092s souls. Here\u0092s to victory.\" \nEXT. TUNNEL \nThe FREEDOM hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises through  the murky  depths. It  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the cave. \nA quartet of  SQUIDDIES slips by.  We follow as  they worm their  ways through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble cockpit by mere feet. \nFREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi  at the controls. \nINT. FREEDOM COCKPIT \nThey watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance. \n\"Right.\" \nRAZOR \n\"Well, my point is, the machines code and recode the Matrix by pure will. Interaction with the Matrix, the physical act of being there, by default, allows people to change their environment - the Matrix. They move objects, make sound, affect cause.\" \nNEO \n\"Like reality.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the fabric of reality in the Matrix can be rewoven. Some can reach beyond normal cause. Their affects on the Matrix are deeper than average. They have learned to change it according to their needs. But they don\u0092t have total control. That\u0092s why we need operators like Razor here. But you, you go further than any of us can.\" \nNEO \n\"How?\" \nRAZOR stands  and taps  Neo\u0092s skull.  He stretches,  grabs a  Japanese style  wooden  sword, and,  out  of boredom,  starts  performing slow, precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks. \nRAZOR \n\"The equipment you carry up here. You\u0092re a freak. A good freak. You\u0092re neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. This, combined with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the reality of the Matrix.\" \nNEO \n\"How did I end up as... a freak?\" \nRAZOR practices the same strike a few times. \nRAZOR \n\"Good question. The Machines create people through cloning, since, obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. Theoretically, all clones in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. They shouldn\u0092t be any different from normal, homegrowns.\" \nNEO \n\"OK, so how do you explain me?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were all born inside. \nNEO \n\"Well, what separates us from others?\" \nTRINITY \n\"For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children in the Matrix. They\u0092ve been mutating, changing in ways the machines never predicted. Some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength. Others seem to have psychic powers.\" \nRAZOR looks up to see MORPHEUS,  hanging back as he listens. He  comes forward. \nMORPHEUS \n\"And others are able to change the reality of the Matrix itself.\" \nHE points to Neo. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Discussing history, are we?\" \nRAZOR shakes his head. \nRAZOR \n\"I\u0092m trying to teach this fool some programming, man. He\u0092s stuck in the 20^th century. He\u0092s got no skills, man. Without us, he\u0092s helpless.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"In the Matrix, without him, we\u0092re helpless.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Not until we reach broadcast depth. It\u0092s slow going out there. I guess they know we\u0092re coming back, so they\u0092re patrolling. We have time to rest and ready.\" \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TOP, LATE DAY (CONSTRUCT) \nTRINITY sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far as the eye can see, lie mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in the sunset light. \nShe looks into the sunset. Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind. \nA hand appears on her shoulder. It\u0092s NEO. How he got on the finger  of rock is anyone\u0092s guess. \nNEO \n\"Boo.\" \nTRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm. There is only enough room for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her. \nTRINITY \n\"Don\u0092t lose your balance.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Showing you, Neo.\" \nNEO \n\"Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack.\" \nTRINITY \n\"I want you to know how much faith I have in you.\" \nNEO \n\"Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?\" \nTRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close. \n\"So, you really are Superman.\" \nNEO \n\"Only when I\u0092m plugged in.\" \nTRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He attempts a \nkiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek. \nNEO \n\"What?\" \nTRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky. \nTRINITY \n\"It\u0092s not you. Just, not here.\" \nNEO doesn\u0092t understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes. \nTRINITY \n\"They\u0092re watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer geeks get?\" \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nCHOI,  RAZOR,  DUJOUR, and  CIRCA  are sitting  around  the operator\u0092s console, feet up, eating. On the screens are patchy images of  TRINITY and NEO standing together in  the GLADE. It\u0092s like they\u0092re  watching a soap opera. \nTRINITY and NEO are looking in their direction. \nON THE interface chairs, the bodies of TRINITY and NEO lay supine. \nEXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT) \nTRINITY grabs NEO by the arm. \nTRINITY \n\"Over here.\" \nSHE leads him into the shadows. \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nTHE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear off the screen and into the darkness. \nRAZOR puts his hand on CIRCA\u0092S shoulder and sighs. \nRAZOR \n\"So romantic.\" \nCIRCA calmly pats his hand and removes it, holding it in front of him. \nCIRCA \n\"I\u0092m sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I.\" \nEXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT) \nIN the blue twilight shade, NEO and TRINITY kiss tentatively,  slowly, then quicker as  they give in  to their feelings  for one another.  WE move around them slowly, then pan into the shadows, a natural fadeout. \nINT. OFFICE (MATRIX) \nAGENTS  JONES and  BROWN sit  across from  each other,  a steel  table between them.  They stare  at each  other for  what seems  like a long time. There is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst  neat stacks of file folders. \nAGENT JONES \n\"Our defeat is worrisome.\" \nAGENT BROWN \n\"As is the loss of our colleague.\" \nTHEY ARE BOTH seething with anger. AGENT JONES grinds his molars. \nJONES \nANGLE ON: the radar gun. It\u0092s flashing 125 MPH \nCOP \n\"Holy shit. Drunk ass punks.\" \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nGREGORY is facing us as he  drops back into his seat, taking  his beer on cue from CHANDRA. Behind them, the cop\u0092s lights flare up. \nGREGORY \n\"Oh boy. Stop, stop, let\u0092s have some fun.\" \nINT. COP CAR \nWE look  through the  windshield as  the cop  drives down the highway, calling in his  stop-vehicle report. He  suddenly sees something  that makes him slam on the brakes. \nCOP \n\"Holy shit!\" \nANGLE THROUGH the  cop\u0092s windshield. The  ten bikers, with  GREGORY at their center, are  parked in the  middle of the  road, looking at  him casually.\" \nEXT. ROAD \nTHE cruiser comes to  a stop mere inches  from GREGORY\u0092S leg. The  COP bursts out of the door. \nCOP \n\"What the hell are you doing?\" \nGREGORY \n\"We\u0092ll tell you when to stop, little man. Not the other way around.\" \nCOP \n\"Fuck.\" \nHE DIVES back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. GREGORY  pulls a huge silver .44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruiser\u0092s antenna  is blown off at the  base, and the nine-foot  whip flips onto the  ground with a metallic clang. \nINT. CRUISER \nThe COP is  lying half-on the  seat, taking cover.  The handset relays only static. He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregory\u0092s voice. \nGREGORY \n\"Don\u0092t try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating ass.\" \nEXT. CRUISER \nThe cop comes out with his hands up. \nCOP \n\"Whaddya want with me?\" \nGREGORY \n\"I don\u0092t know. I just thought I\u0092d find out what you wanted without you shooting at me. So, what do you want?\" \nTHE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious. \nCOP \n\"You\u0092re all under arrest.\" \nTHE PACK explodes with laughter. GREGORY walks up to the policeman and circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction. \nGREGORY \n\"This is your lucky day, officer. We\u0092re gonna give you a night off.\" \nCHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard liquour. \nCHANDRA \n\"Drink.\" \nWHEN  he  pauses,   GREGORY  places  the   gun  against  his   temple. Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol. \nGREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle. \nGREGORY \n\"You never even saw us, man.\" \nCHANDRA \n\"Keep the bottle.\" \nTHEY start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows  of the road. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEACH \nCHANDRA looks back and sees the lights turn away. She screams over the wind and the roar. \nCHANDRA \n\"They\u0092re gone!\" \nGREGORY is staring down a dark highway. \nGREGORY \n\"Can\u0092t see shit.\" \nHE turns the headlights  back on, just in  time to see a  ROADBLOCK of heavy duty military trucks. In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall manned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one looks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the side. \nTHE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run frantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal flying at 150 miles per hour. \nGREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked trucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags. THEY\u0092RE THROUGH, but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we drop into bullet-time. \nAS the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as GREGORY  dismounts, grabbing CHANDRA as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike. A \nmassive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a bullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the rotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against the flesh-ripping concrete. \nTHE bike is coming apart  as it\u0092s bashed against the  concrete. Pieces rise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers, and a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air, carrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - she\u0092s barely conscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real time. \nTHE  bike\u0092s body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them. They  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them. \nSTUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder. \nTHEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a stop. \nGREGORY \n\"Split up, into the desert, go!\" \nTHEY split. \nCU on CHANDRA. In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. The highway is  littered with  pieces of  the bike,  and she  stomps on  a twisted piece of metal  that impales her bare  foot. She falls to  the asphalt with a scream. \nGREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is bearing down on them, it\u0092s V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD. \nGREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high beams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME. \nTHE CRUISER  runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel post. The hood crumples  in the center, pushing  the grill in even  as the front quarter  panels of the  unibody continue around  GREGORY and CHANDRA. \nINT. CRUISER \nTHE ENGINE smashes in through  the console, pushing the cops  apart as the glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the console, smashing them like jelly. \nCU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA \nWITH  HIS  HAND  still  on  the  grille,  CHANDRA  AND  GREGORY remain untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop back into REAL  time and see  the cruiser\u0092s body  rip over and  around them. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission remain still against  GREGORY\u0092S HAND. The  cruiser was gutted,  like a banana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them, silent now, flips and explodes. \nTHE ENGINE block is suspended a few  feet in the air. It drops to  the ground with a thud. \nGREGORY and CHANDRA get to their  feet and run into the early  morning desert. \nCU: GUTTED CRUISER \nUNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering  wheel is smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open. Wet, broken chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS. \nEXT. GUTTED CRUISER \nTHE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out  of the frame. WE SEE a  black loafer step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out slowly. \nWE rise  up from  the loafer.  As the  other cruisers  catch up to the scene of the accident, AGENT BROWN watches. He looks into the desert. \nA POLICE lieutenant approaches BROWN. \nLIEUTENANT \n\"Sir, should we pursue?\" \nAGENT BROWN \n\"Withdraw your men and pursue the others. We have our own plans for this one.\" \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE (NIGHT) \nThe ship is  quiet. RAZOR sits  at the operator  console, smashing the keyboard as he forces Tetris pieces into place. \nINT. COCKPIT \nCHOI is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop. He speaks into his headphones. \nCHOI \n\"OK, try it here.\" \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nRAZOR halts his video game playing and flashes to a different  screen. Lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits  the ENTER key with a flourish. The screen flashes, and the familiar scroll of the MATRIX cascades down the screens. \nRAZOR \n\"Holy shit.\" \nCUT TO: \nGREGORY \n\"What for?\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"A better life for all. Life for her. And for you, a chance for revenge.\" \nGREGORY raises his head. \nAGENT SMITH grins. He turns away, and the desert landscape before them turns into a soothing, cool,  crystal forest lake. Smith takes  a step toward it, then turns and extends his hand. \nAGENT SMITH \n\"Interested?\" \nGREGORY  is  mystified.  Speechless, he  drags  himself  to his  feet, hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake. \nGREGORY \n\"This can\u0092t be real.\" \nHE steps forward, only to have the image recede. \nAGENT SMITH \n\"You this, don\u0092t you?\" \nGREGORY \n\"Yes.\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"Will you help us?\" \nGREGORY \n\"Anything.\" \nCU:  SMITH  extends his  hand.  GREGORY grasps  it.  He lets  go,  and collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge. \nEXT. LAKE SHORE \nTHE  DESERT  is  gone,  replaced by  forest,  though  still  under the poisoned sky of the Matrix. \nGREGORY laps  the water  up, and  pulls CHANDRA  in, rubbing the water over her face. Calmly, AGENT SMITH stands on the lake shore. \nCU:  AGENT SMITH.  The humans  are reflected  in his  perfectly still glasses. \nCHANDRA  stirs and  awakens, though  she doesn\u0092t  seem to  see  SMITH. GREGORY,  revitalized, looks  around at  the miracle,  and up  at the mystery man. \nGREGORY \n\"Who the fuck are you?\" \nSMITH grins devilishly. \nAGENT SMITH \n\"I\u0092m nobody. A Smith. What\u0092s more important, is you. We need you, Gregory.\" \nGREGORY stares. He pulls CHANDRA ashore and stands to look AGENT SMITH in the eyes. \nGREGORY \n\"First you try to kill me. Now you need me.\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist attack in the heart of the city.\" \nTHE words spark something nasty in GREGORY. \nGREGORY \n\"So what?\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"The terrorists were led by a certain individual.\" \nGREGORY \n\"I know who it was.\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"We need you to kill him.\" \nGREGORY laughs he turns to CHANDRA  to check on her. She\u0092s passed  out on the smooth grass. \nGREGORY \n\"What a bunch of bullshit. The whole government can\u0092t kill him, so how can I?\" \nAGENT SMITH \nMORPHEUS \n\"We\u0092re deep in their territory.\" \nNEO \n\"I see that.\" \nMORPHEUS stares out at the night, deep in thought. He turns to NEO. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Are you rested?\" \nNEO \n\"Yes.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You know now, that you had predecessors.\" \nNEO \n\"Yes. I\u0092ve heard things.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"What types of things?\" \nNEO \n\"That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be special. But they ended up dead.\" \nMORPHEUS nods slowly. \nMORPHEUS \n\"It\u0092s true. There were others. And I didn\u0092t tell you right away. Because you were not ready.\" \nNEO nods. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Does this anger you?\" \nNEO \n\"I don\u0092t know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I can\u0092t decide whether or not I\u0092m angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You shouldn\u0092t be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracle\u0092s prophecy. Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing.\" \nNEO \n\"What?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"The destruction of The Matrix.\" \nMORPHEUS looks out into the darkness. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world for you, and to baptize you by fire. But from here on out, no one knows.\" \nNEO \n\"Can we ask The Oracle.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Not in this life.\" \nNEO is confused. \nMORPHEUS \n\"No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher turned on us.\" \nNEO is taken aback. \nNEO \n\"But she must have known, if they came to her.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"Perhaps she did.\" \nNEO shakes his head. \nNEO \n\"I can\u0092t believe it. I don\u0092t know, Morpheus, if I\u0092m prepared for this war. I\u0092m not a soldier. How, how are we going to win?\" \nNEO nods. CHOI\u0092S smile fades. He looks to the others. \nCHOI \n\"He\u0092s joking right?\" \nMORPHEUS shakes his head. \nMORPHEUS \n\"We\u0092ll fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. If you\u0092re able to accomplish this mission, we\u0092ll phase back into the ship. Stay in contact. If you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately.\" \nEXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE \nTHE five  of them  exit. They  blend into  the crowds  on the  street, anonymous and  quiet. MORPHEUS  looks back  as NEO,  taller than most, heads down the street. \nNIOBE pauses next to him. \nNIOBE \n\"What is it?\" \nMORPHEUS shakes his head. \nMORPHEUS \n\"What\u0092s going to happen? If this is it, right now? The end?\" \nNIOBE \n\"I can\u0092t even imagine.\" \nHE grins  and starts  to turn.  As he  does, his  profile matches  the profile on  a WANTED  poster stuck  to the  wall. It\u0092s  a dark, grainy picture of him, alongside photos of Neo, and Trinity. \nPOSTER: INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS \nMORPHEUS glances at it, and continues on. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET \nNEO walks  calmly, observing  the people  that filter  by. Men, women, children, all oblivious to their true nature. \nA dirty homeless whino, nose  explosion red with burst blood  vessels, is  staggering  along  the  edge of  the  crowd,  unseen  and ignored. Somehow, he catches NEO\u0092s eye. \nHOMELESS \n\"Spare a quarter, buddy?\" \nNEO shakes his head, but still stares. \nANGLE on  the HOMELESS.  He mutters  something, and  reaches into  his shopping cart to  open a garbage  bag. It\u0092s filled  with twenty dollar bills, thousands of them. \nNEO \n\"How \u0091bout a quarter mil?\" \nTHE homeless  man is  astounded. As  he stands,  speechless, NEO fades back into the crowd. \nEXT. FOREST GLADE \nSMITH and GREGORY fight in the glade. SMITH is always one step  ahead. HE is a cruel  sensei, and doesn\u0092t pull  punches. But with every  blow GREGORY takes, he rebounds and attacks again. \nFINALLY, just as  he seems to  be gaining on  SMITH, he takes  a rapid fire series  of blows,  and collapses  to the  ground, breathless  and beaten. \nGREGORY \n\"Fuck.\" \nSMITH circles him. \nSMITH \n\"Pain is only weakness leaving your body. When you are sufficiently strong, you will feel no pain.\" \nGREGORY \n\"Tell me about what is happening. What\u0092s wrong with the world?\" \nSMITH \n\"Get up and fight.\" \nGREGORY gets to his feet and takes a stance. SMITH stares at him  from a relaxed poise. He slaps at GREGORY, who deflects the blow and  takes a jab, nearly hitting SMITH on the chin. They circle. \nSMITH \n\"The world is not for you.\" \nHE slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow. \nGREGORY \n\"What do you mean?\" \nSMITH \n\"You\u0092re not human, Gregory. That\u0092s why you don\u0092t fit in. That\u0092s why you have certain powers.\" \nThe walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred  people - office  workers, security,  maintenance men,  standing with  nothing between them. \nThe massive LOAD BEARING MEMBERS vaporize. \nCUT TO: the bottom of the building. One can look straight through  the entire  building.  WE go  through  the empty  building,  passing dazed people, until we pass out the other side, and come to NEO. \nHE looks up. The office  building is supported by nothing.  Slowly, it descends on the stunned people. They rush, screaming, some laughing in hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. The last few  flee just before  the ceiling  touches the  ground. The  second floor melts away just like the first. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP \nNIOBE and MORPHEUS  stare on in  amazement as the  building collapses, floor by floor. \nNIOBE \n\"He\u0092s doing it.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"I knew it.\" \nEXT. STREET \nCHOI and  TRINITY look  up in  the air  at the  roof of the METACORTEX building, standing beyond  a block of  buildings. It sinks  toward the ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner. \nCHOI \n\"It can\u0092t be this easy.\" \nTRINITY \n\"It\u0092s not over yet.\" \nMAN\u0092S VOICE (O.S.) \n\"Not by a long shot.\" \nCU: TRINITY\u0092S FACE. SOMEONE plants the barrel of a silver Desert Eagle .45 against her temple. TRINITY  whips her head backward as  it fires. We drop into BULLET TIME as the flame and concussion blossoms in front of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling a pair of MAC-10 Uzis from under her jacket. \nTHE MAN\u0092S VOICE belongs to AGENT BROWN \nCHOI turns,  pulling a  short weapon  from under  his coat. It\u0092s boxy, with a short barrel the size of a soda can. He plants it in the  small of BROWN\u0092S back and pulls the trigger. \nA CONE  OF FIRE  burns straight  through brown,  blowing steam, flame, smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach. \nCU on the weapon. It recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the size of a 12-ounce soda can. \nREAL TIME \nWhat remains  of BROWN  flies forward.  CHOI helps  TRINITY up and the retreat into the building and  take cover under a window.  Through the window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down  the street, toward the Metacortex  plaza. After the trucks  come rumbling, black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE HELICOPTER flies  over the convoy. \nCHOI looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon. \nCHOI \n\"Holy fucking shit.\" \nTRINITY \n\"We\u0092ve stirred up the hornet\u0092s nest now.\" \nINT. METACORTEX OFFICE \nAGENT SMITH and JONES stare  down into the plaza. The  building shakes slightly as it descends. \nFROM the three  streets that enter  the plaza, military  vehicles pour in. Hundreds  of troops  discharge and  form a  L-shaped circle around NEO. Tanks  rumble in,  and the  Apaches whirl  to a  hover. Panicking civilians rush out of the kill zone. \nNEO stands calmly, continuing his work. \nEXT. ROOFTOP \nMORPHEUS and NIOBE stare from the rooftop. \nEXT. METACORTEX PLAZA \nThe air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse. The  sky flashes, and massive streaks of  lighting blast across it like  cracks in reality. \nCU: SOLDIERS \nThey line their weapons on NEO. They are nervous \nPRIVATE \n\"This is impossible. What\u0092s going on?\" \nSERGEANT \n\"Just keep him in your sites, soldier.\" \nINT. TANK TURRET \nCU: TANK GUNNER \nHIS eye is glued to the tank  site and his trigger finger on the  fire button. \nPOV: TANK SITE \nThe green crosshairs sit on NEO\u0092S chest. \nAGENT BROWN \n\"What about your prot\u00e9g\u00e9?\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"He\u0092s not ready yet. I\u0092ll deal with this myself.\" \nAGENT JONES \n\"You can\u0092t beat him.\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"I\u0092ve been altered. I\u0092m Smith, 2.0.\" \nAGENTS BROWN and JONES look at one another. \nCU: SMITH \nHE clenches his teeth, as though he\u0092s girding himself for something. \nSMITH \n\"Kill the others. I\u0092ll take care of this.\" \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nRAZOR is at  his operator chair,  surrounded by consoles.  Some of the Matrix code screens are in blue, others in red, at least one in green. The code  on the  green screen  starts pouring  down at  an incredible rate. \nRAZOR \n\"Fuck.\" \nHE hits something on the keypad. \nEXT. ROOF \nMORPHEUS answers his phone. \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nRAZOR \n\"They\u0092re about to pull something. Processing power is pouring into the agent programs and they\u0092re locking onto your 3-D grid displacements. \nEXT. ROOF \nMORPHEUS \n\"Send through ghosts to confuse their lock.\" \nRAZOR \n\"Got it.\" \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nTHE GHOST program  is loaded. We  see 3-D images  of Morpheus and  the others flash across the screen. \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING \nSMITH STANDS alone, his comrades have disappeared. \nTHE glass before him shimmers. \nEXT. OFFICE \nTHE mirrored glass of Smith\u0092s office wavers, then explodes towards us. SMITH jumps, and we pan down to follow his descent. He smacks into the pavement on his feet in front of NEO. \nEXT. METACORTEX PLAZA \nSMITH STANDS, facing NEO, about two fighting distances away. \nNEO\u0092s  concentration is  broken. The  METACORTEX building  comes to  a shuddering halt. \nNEO \n\"You\u0092re back.\" \nCU: SMITH \nHe nods. \nNEO \n\"And you have a ponytail now.\" \nAS we concentrate  on NEO, and  he concentrates on  SMITH, we can  see more black suits marching up behind him. \nNEO attacks SMITH. SMITH backs away slowly, blocking against a  losing battle and taking hits. Meanwhile,  the MEN IN BLACK converge  on NEO. Just as NEO  lands a smashing  blow on SMITH\u0092S  chin, three voices  at once shout: \n\"HEY!\" \nNEO turns,  and SMITH  pushes him  hard in  the opposite  direction to face: \nTHREE SMITHS! They attack at once, one going low and hard with a  knee breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third breaking to the  side and putting  his toe into  NEO\u0092s stomach with  a vicious side-kick. \n\"Choi? Oh my God, I haven\u0092t seen you for months.\" \nCHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth. \n\"Oh yeah, sorry about that.\" \nSHE turns angry. \n\"Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?\" \nEXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY \nTRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley. \nTRINITY \n\"Casanova just ran into an old flame.\" \nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nWOMAN \n\"No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you please?\" \nCHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as  she is having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face. \n\"Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - \" \nInexplicably, CHOI  hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth. Standing behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coat between his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesn\u0092t even notice the  web of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  the inside of the jacket. \nWOMAN \n\" - you\u0092ll tell me why you don\u0092t call, why you, you, what are you doing?\" \nCHOI \n\"The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss me for luck.\" \nHE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers. \nCU: PHONE \nHis hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one of the  numbers of  the keypad.  The number  tone rises  in pitch to a crescendo. WE pull back and: \nTHE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame. \nEXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY \nThey take  cover from  the blast  as people  all over  the street  are knocked flat. \nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nTHE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.  Miraculously, CHOI and the woman  are still under the cover of  the jacket. THROWING the smoking  jacket off them, CHOI screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  his right shoulder. The arm is history. \nTHE WOMAN looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates. Shaking,  she falls back, still staring. \nCHOI \n\"You weren\u0092t lucky.\" \nMORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his  feet. CHOI is  screaming and  laughing. Someone  grabs his  smoldering coat, dragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away. His eyes are crazy. \nCHOI \n\"You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!\" \nAS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own. PEOPLE run from the scene, screaming. \nCU - the four of them. \nMORPHUES looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns. HE  pulls to the left. \nMORPHEUS \n\"This way.\" \nTANKS and  TROOPS are  filling into  the street  ahead of them, coming from around the corner. \nTHEY turn onto a different  street. This street, too, is  filling with troops. Worse, it\u0092s being lead by AGENT BROWN. \nNIOBE \n\"Tanks, or agents?\" \nTRINITY \n\"Tanks.\" \nCHOI \n\"Yeah, tanks a lot.\" \nThey break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the  street with the tanks. \nCU: TANKS \nTHREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place with terrifying quickness and precision. \nMORPHEUS \n\"None. They\u0092ve killed city-wide comms.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Then the agents are out of touch with each other.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"They can\u0092t track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our exits, and find the Neb. We\u0092ll try the desert. Communications might be working there still.\" \nTRINITY \n\"What about Niobe?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"She knows to meet us there.\" \nEXT. HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - DAY \nNIOBE\u0092s bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over 100 miles  per hour.  The wheely  bar is  folded up  against the  rear wheel. A dual  stream of vehicles  spit by her  like giant machine-gun bullets. She zooms out of view. \nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY \nGREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and  ambulances race toward  the Metacortex  building. He  can\u0092t shake  what he\u0092s just witnessed. He looks forward, only to run into: \nAGENT SMITH \nGREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions. \nGREGORY \n\"What the fuck just happened?\" \nSMITH \n\"We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?\" \nGREGORY is perplexed. Resolve comes over his face. \nGREGORY \n\"I can stop this?\" \nSMITH \n\"Yes.\" \nGREGORY \n\"Alright. But how can I fight him?\" \nSMITH \n\"I will give you the power you need.\" \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (MATRIX) - DAY \nTHE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that no sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to  THE ORACLE. \nNEO exits an  elevator. Recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks up and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in. \nA tall black woman, one of the Oracle\u0092s priestesses, comes out of  the stairwell and recognizes NEO. \nPRIESTESS \n\"Neo.\" \nHE turns  and looks  at her.  She smiles,  but as  Neo looks at her, a flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the smile returns. \nPRIESTESS \n\"The Oracle is anxious to see you.\" \nNEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are  covered, and NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess moves into the dark kitchen. \nNEO\u0092s eyes  adjust to  the darkness.  He hears  something squish as he steps, and looks down. \nThe tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid. NEO reaches down and touches it with his fingertips. It\u0092s half-dried blood. \nHe stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now. The walls are  chipped, covered in bullet holes. \nIn slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks  AGENT BROWN. NEO turns to the  kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES  appear. They all draw their .45s. \nNEO stands  still as  they walk  up to  him and  put their guns to his head. \nAGENT SMITH scoffs. \nNEO \n\"I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you, to destroy you.\" \nAGENT JONES \n\"What are you waiting for?\" \n\"Why?\" \nJONES \n\"So our kind... prevails.\" \nNEO \n\"You mean, lives.\" \nSMITH \n\"Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us first.\" \nBROWN \n\"But you didn\u0092t. You\u0092re not as tough as you think.\" \nNEO \n\"We\u0092ll see.\" \nTHE three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door of the apartment. NEO opens it,  and stops, his face meeting a  flying FIST. His vision  FLASHES with the  impact, and he  staggers back into the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet. \nGREGOR steps into the room, tall and BAD. \nNEO holds up a hand. \nNEO \n\"Stop! I don\u0092t want to fight you! You\u0092re human!\" \nGREGORY  doesn\u0092t  answer.  He  smashes  a  side-kick  into  NEO\u0092s gut, doubling him over. \nTHE kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashes past Gregor. It sends NEO crashing out the window. \nGREGORY stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  three agents. There\u0092s nothing on the street, twenty stories below. \nThe building  starts trembling.  We hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growing louder and coming faster. \nTHE FLOOR EXPLODES  as NEO crashes  up through the  concrete, throwing the agents away as  he embraces GREGORY in  a bear hug. THEY  blast up through the ceiling. WE follow them up through three more floors, bam, bam, bam. Each concrete floor smashes GREGORY in the head. \nEXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY \nNEO and GREGORY SMASH through the roof, flying upward, like a missile, past us. \nEXT. SKY (MATRIX) - DAY \nCU: NEO \nHIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. GREGORY is  barely conscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings Gregory\u0092s body violently earthward. \nNEO looks down as  the body falls toward  the city, thousands of  feet below. He turns away,  just as the distant  GREGORY is falling out  of sight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and  grows larger and larger as  it returns. A contrail  streaks behind him as  a rips through  the air.  FISTS FORWARD,  GREGORY is  like an MX missile bearing on NEO. \nNEO turns just in  time to catch BOTH  FISTS in his chest.  Like a cue ball striking another billiard,  all Gregor\u0092s momentum is  transferred into Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view. \nCU: GREGOR \nHE is in  shock somehow as  he sees NEO  flying away. He  clenches his fists and flexes his body, then looks down. \nWE see the ground, thousands of feet below. \nGREGORY \n\"Holy shit!\" \nFOR some  reason, he  starts to  fall. Even  as he  claws to  maintain altitude, his  rational mind  has caught  up with  him and  is somehow denying the fact that he can fly. \nAs he\u0092s  facing the  ground, NEO  slams into  him from above. Gripping Gregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  ground rushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper. Neo slams  Gregor,  front first,  into  the concrete  sidewalk.  They bust through the sidewalk, into the sewer below. \nINT. SEWER (MATRIX) - DAY \nNEO stands. Offscreen,  we can here  choking breaths. Neo  looks down. Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through the chest by snapped, rusty rebar.  He takes one last breath, and  his eyes half-close. \nNEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole. \nCU: GREGORY \nHIS eyes  blink, and  he follows  NEO\u0092s departure.  Choking, unable to breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. There\u0092s nothing for him to grab to pull himself off the steel. \nHis eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling his body off the rebar.  The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds as the pull through his body.  Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of bar, and can\u0092t make it over. He\u0092s losing all his breath, all his  life force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest. \nWITH one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him. HIS mouth opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of the steel bar enters his body and we can\u0092t take any more, \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - SUNSET \nTHE Countach and bike  zip down a long,  perfectly flat empty road.  A brown sunset plagues the horizon. There is no civilization in sight. \nINT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET \nMORPHEUS tries his cell again. This time, it reaches the Neb. \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nRAZOR and CIRCA are both operating the consoles. \n\"Where is Neo?\" \nCIRCA \n\"Haven\u0092t heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of the Matrix.\" \nMORPHEUS appears enraged. He looks at Neo, supine on his chair. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Why does it still exist? Why hasn\u0092t he destroyed it yet?\" \nRAZOR \n\"Maybe he can\u0092t.\" \nTRINITY is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like hell. \nTRINITY \n\"Is he even alive? Is he captured?\" \nRAZOR \n\"Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Haven\u0092t locked onto him since.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"What? Why not?\" \nCIRCA \n\"Call me crazy, but I think he\u0092s masking his own displacement signature.\" \nRAZOR \n\"His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back and forth.\" \nMORPHEUS  stares at  the data  on the  screens. The  Matrix lives.  He pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an incredible rate. It\u0092s obvious Morpheus can handle computers. \nMORPHEUS \n\"I found him once. I\u0092ll find him again.\" \nWe  go deeper  into the  miasma of  green symbols,  swallowed by  the blackness of the screen, and emerge into: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nThe apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a leather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off. He absentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers. Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter. \nHolding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as though it was a disk of bubble  gum. He folds it again, then rools  it as though it\u0092s a musket ball. \nChandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. She reaches points the remote at the TV, but Gregory puts his hand over it to  get her attention. \nGREGORY \n\"So, you really don\u0092t have any idea how you got here?\" \nCHANDRA \n\"No. I only remember being on the bike.\" \nGREGORY sighs. \nGREGORY \n\"Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we got this place?\" \nShe looks at him, annoyed. \nCHANDRA \n\"Duh. We broke in. We don\u0092t own a penthouse.\" \nGREGORY \n\"What if I said we did?\" \nCHANDRA \n\"I\u0092d say you\u0092re insane.\" \nShe finally gets the remote and changes the channel. The volume  comes on, louder and  infinitely more tinny  and obnoxious than  anything in life. Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space. \nINT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nNEO sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring  ahead. He\u0092s  in the  belfry of  an ancient,  destroyed cathedral,  among the pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap. \nFROM here, in  downtown, we can  see the modern,  uptown section, with its  gleaming  skyscrapers. METACORTEX  still  stands, illuminated  by searchlights. \nNEO sits and broods. Isolated, his world turned upside down and  right side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank. \nAgain, he tries his cell phone.  Static. He collapses it and puts  it. Just as it leaves his mind, it rings. The face flips open. \nNEO puts it to his ear without speaking. \nMORPHEUS (O.S.) \n", "test1_input": "\"He is the -\" \nNIOBE puts a finger to his lips. \nNIOBE \n\"Six came before him, Morpheus.\" \nMORPHEUS shakes his head slowly. \nMORPHEUS \n\"To me, none came before him. The Oracle told me I would find the one. It is prophecy. You haven\u0092t seen what he can do.\" \nNIOBE \n\"What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"There are lots of ifs. How about this one: What if we lose faith in our cause?\" \nHE disappears through the door, leaving Niobe standing in the dim light. \nINT. MAIN BRIDGE \nMORPHEUS leans over RAZOR and CHOI. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Talk to me.\" \nRAZOR \n\"Not good, boss, I gotta compile a new descrambler.\" \nMORPHEUS nods. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Do it. We\u0092re at broadcast depth?\" \nCHOI \n\"Yes sir.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"We have to download our mission specs. Move aside, I have to log into the mainframe.\" \nMORPHEUS  takes  over  RAZORS  seat.  The  scrolling  code disappears, replaced by the small words: ZION.dtr1.mnfr4m3 LOGON. \nMORPHEUS pushes  the keyboard  under the  console so  its hidden  from view. He taps at the  keyboard. Hidden password appears on  the screen in the form of: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \nSCREEN: LOGON ACCEPTED. WELCOME, MORPHEUS. \nMISSION SPECS DOWNLOADING... \nDOWNLOADED \nLOGOUT COMPLETE \nMISSION TYPE: INFILTRATION / DESTRUCTION \nTARGET: MATRIX MAINFRAME \nMORPHEUS\u0092 eyes open slightly when he reads the screen, but he  regains his  composure  quickly. RAZOR\u0092S  mouth  drops open,  and  CHOI starts cracking up. \nCHOI \n\"The mainframe? Haha. It\u0092s a joke, right Morpheus? Is today April 1^st \nNIOBE appears behind them. \nNIOBE \n\"It\u0092s not a joke. We have The One. We must do it now.\" \nRAZOR \n\"But they\u0092re altering the code already. I can\u0092t even read it yet.\" \nMORPHEUS turns and faces them. \nMORPHEUS \n\"We have our mission, but it\u0092s up to us to interperate how we\u0092ll do it.\" \nRAZOR \n\"Morpheus, there\u0092s more ice in front of that mainframe than there is in Antarctica. We\u0092ll never cut through it all.\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"You haven\u0092t seen The One in action.\" \nRAZOR looks dubious, and turns to the screens. \n", "test1_true": "\"Can you hack in?\" \nRAZOR pounds the keys.

He\u0092s heard every word. He rounds the corner. The others catch sight of him. The same thought is on everyone's mind: How much had he heard. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the crew. Razor, what\u0092s the ETA for getting us in there?\" \nRAZOR shakes his head. \nRAZOR \n\"I dunno.

DESERT (DAY) \nFROM FAR AWAY, we see GREGORY and CHANDRA hiding under the only bit of shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. We sail in  and cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto  CHANDRA\u0092S feet, clad in Gregory\u0092s boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs. She\u0092s collapsed onto Gregory. He\u0092s in equally bad shape. Gregory leans with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he  drifts in and out of sleep. \nGREGORY POV \nHe  stars at  the horizon  and the  mirages of  water reflecting  the jaundiced yellow sky. In the  shimmering distance, a man appears,  but Gregory\u0092s lids  shut and  we see  darkness. When  he reopens them, the figure is more clear. It\u0092s a man, dressed in a black suit. Even in the distance we can recognize him. We want it to be him. \nEXT. DESERT ROCK \nGREGORY  can  barely come  to  his senses  as  the figure  approaches. CHANDRA doesn\u0092t even wake. \nEXT. DESERT \nWe follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches GREGORY. It comes to a stop just in front of him. \nEXT. DESERT ROCK \nGREGORY is fully  awake, but he  thinks he\u0092s dreaming.  He reaches out and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him - a man who doesn\u0092t sweat even in the sauna heat. He looks up, but the glaring sun obscures the face. \nGREGORY\u0092s voice is raspy as he starts to speak. \nGREGORY \n\"Oh my God. It\u0092s... The Man.\" \nMAN IN BLACK \n\"I\u0092ve been searching for you for a long time, my friend.\" \nGREGORY lowers his head. \nMAN IN BLACK \n\"We need you, Gregory.\" \nGREGORY \n\"What for?\" \nMAN IN BLACK \n\"To save our world.\" \nGREGORY\u0092S FACE  RAISES, THE  MAN IN  BLACK eclipses  the sun  with his head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face: AGENT SMITH. \nGREGORY\u0092S head drops back down. He strokes CHANDRA\u0092S hair. \nGREGORY \n\"It\u0092s too late. We\u0092re dead.\" \nAGENT SMITH \n\"Do you want to live?\" \n", "test1_id": 975, "test2_input": "\"NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what you\u0092re doing.\" \nNEO \n\"Well, is that right?\" \nHE turns  to the  METACORTEX building.  It\u0092s repairing,  growing steel girders and concrete skin. \nNEO\u0092s face darkens. \nNEO \n\"No!\" \nREALITY SHIMMERS as  his anger strikes  out at the  building. The tops floors burn, and then explode.  The explosion rips down the  building, slowing, slowing, then stopping. \nTHOUSANDS of SMITHS  are gazing up  at the building,  concentrating on combating NEO\u0092s attack. \nEXT. ROOF \nGREGORY sees the building exploding,  and runs. He smashes through  an access door. \nINT. STAIRWAY \nGREGORY hurtles down the stairs, one at a time. \nEXT. METACORTEX BUILDING \nTHE building is frozen, mid-explosion.  TONS of pieces hanging in  the air, suspended only by frozen tendrils  of fire and arms of smoke  and debris. \nTHE SMITHS attack NEO. They fight  in a massive melee, dying in  mass. Meanwhile, the METACORTEX building pulls back together, the damage and flame disappearing as time/space around it is reversed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROOFTOP \nCU: AGENT BROWN \nWith  his hand  on his  ear piece,  he comes  out the  elevator door, slowly. Pistol drawn, he looks around the corner. \nMORPHEUS and NIOBE stand there, their backs to him. \nWithout hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity. \nTHE BODIES of MORPHEUS and  NIOBE are wracked by gunfire  and collapse in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh. \nBROWN  walks  up  to the  corpses  and  kicks one  with  his  shoe. It shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other. \nINT. MAIN DECK \nRAZOR dials the phone.

They exit the roof as he dials TRINITY \nINT. EMPTY BUILDING \nCHOI and TRINITY hide  in the shadows of  an empty room, watching  the battle. TRINITY\u0092S cell rings. She answers silently. \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) \n\"Let\u0092s go. Laxe Three.\" \nTRINITY \n\"What about Neo?\" \nMORPHEUS (V.O.) \n\"We can do nothing to help him.

Slumbering  bodies lie  everywhere, slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on the ground. \nEXT. PLAZA \nHE exits into the street. The scene is one from HELL. \nUNDER the neon  sky, fires are  frozen and smoke  columns hang in  the air, still, like massive tree trunks. \nThe battle rages and surges,  a thousand SMITHS pouring onto  one NEO. All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed  bodies abandoned  by the  agent. Men  and women,  of all  ages and  designs, smashed, decapitated and broken. \nCU: NEO \nTHE SMITHS overwhelm him  with sheer numbers. NEO  is a blur, a  human chainsaw now,  crushing or  smashing them  all, but  they crowd on all sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and NEO finds himself stepping up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more smashed SMITHS fall,  morph back into their stolen forms, and NEO is KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD. \nHe can\u0092t take it. Choking, NEO struggles to free himself. SMITHS climb up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. NEO  stalls, in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he just killed. She looks amazingly like TRINITY. \nPerhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him. \nNEO goes  berzerk! SCREAMING  and fighting,  he claws  his way out and surges into the wall of agents. They throw him back, and he can\u0092t kill them fast  enough. HE  leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but Smiths cling on to him, and cling on to each other. \nEXT. PLAZA \nNEO struggles to  fly, and as  he does, he\u0092s  pulling a stalagtite  of black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet. \nCU: NEO \nHIS face  is wide  with fear  and shock.  He can\u0092t  climb anymore, and looks back down at the mountain  of agents he\u0092s pulling into the  air. His face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him. He starts to glow, and we jump back to see: \nA MASSIVE orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body. It rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the Smiths away, leaving him clean. \nEVERYTHING slows down  as NEO, exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky. On his way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward from the  concussion. NEO  hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still, sprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like Satan\u0092s snowfall. \nEXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) DAY \nTHE sky and Matrix are still  frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their  way along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause  behind a dumpster, and  just before looking  out, there\u0092s the  sound of metal tapping metal, twice. \nTRINITY looks in  the direction of  the sound. MORPHEUS  and NIOBE are standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY  AND CHOI make their way to them. \nTRINITY peeks  cautiously around  the edge.  On the  other side of the street is a phone booth. \nTRINITY \n\"Is it clear?\" \nMORPHEUS \n\"I smell an ambush.\" \nNIOBE \n\"Me too. Too quiet.\" \nCHOI grips his gun and grimaces. \nCHOI \n\"Too quiet? The world is frozen. I\u0092ll go first.\" \nNO one likes the idea. \nREAL-TIME suddenly returns.  The lightning bolts  in the sky  suddenly re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them  jump out of their skulls. The sounds of the city suddenly flood back. \nON THE street, people stir to  their feet. Everyone is confused as  to what happened. \nEXT. PLAZA \nIT\u0092S a sea of the dead. From its center, NEO emerges, soaked in blood, gagging and  gasping for  breath. He  stumbles over  them. Shocked and crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building. It\u0092s in one piece  again, unharmed. \nHe falls against  a smashed corporate  art sculpture. He  picks a cell phone up from the ground and dials. \nNEO \n\"Morpheus, pick up.\" \nWe hear nothing but static.  Disgusted, NEO throws the phone  away. He falls against the sculpture and looks up. Coming around the corner  of the building is a group of agents and soldiers. \nNEO  sinks down,  staring at  his hands.  He catches  his breath  and concentrates.  The  blood  disappears,  and he  dons  the  suit  of an anonymous soldier in black. His face, too, seems to change. \nHE stands and walks away. We only see his back. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nTHEY weigh their options. Finally, MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Go.\" \nCHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are  lots of people on the streets now. Everyone\u0092s in shock over what  happened, and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city. \nCHOI \n\"And remember, kids, when you\u0092re in a war, never volunteer yourself!\" \nHE walks out  onto the street,  eyeing the phone  booth and everything else. A  gorgeous Asian  businesswoman stumbles  into him. Recognition lights up her face and she stops him. \nWOMAN \n", "test2_id": 976, "test3_input": "MORPHEUS \n\"I thought Razor said their were two cops.\" \nINT. BATHROOM HOUSE (MATRIX) - SUNSET \nA ROOKIE cop, his  face to young for  a razor, is shaking  as he peeks through a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists  who just wasted his partner. He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his service pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs. \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nRAZOR and CIRCA see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen. \nRAZOR \n\"Fuck, fuck fuck!\" \nEXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET \nTHEY smell something\u0092s wrong. They  move, back to back in  a triangle, for the  phone booth,  weapons draw  and looking  in all  direction at once. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Niobe, you first.\" \nTRINITY \n\"Bullshit, it\u0092s my turn.\" \nNIOBE \n\"Junior ranks leave first.\" \nTRINITY enters the booth as the phone starts ringing. \nIt\u0092s the moment Smith was waiting for. \nHE BURSTS  out of  the door,  gun firing  at the  booth. Inside, glass shatters, and blood sprays as  Trinity is riddled with bullets.  Smith doesn\u0092t stop. He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses, phone still ringing. Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth door as it shuts from her weight. \nINT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT) \nTRINITY\u0092S body spasms violently against her harness as her life  signs go berserk.  She\u0092s not  dead, but  death is  only seconds  away. Circa screams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity from which he derived his name. \nEXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - NIGHT \nMORPHEUS and NIOBE open fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at him. The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and empty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground. \nMORPHEUS throws the guns down and turns to Niobe. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Get her out.\" \nNIOBE dives for  the shattered booth,  kicking away the  starred glass and  answering  the  ringing  phone.  She  pulls  it  down,  and hauls Trinity\u0092s destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear. \nTRINITY\u0092S head merely sags lifelessly to one side. \nNIOBE \n\"Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit don\u0092t give up!\" \nTRINITY\u0092S  eyes   flicker.  She   focuses  on   Niobe,  summoning  her consciousness enough to make the  phase back into the real  world. She starts to fade as we cut to: \nINT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT) \nCIRCA stands over  Trinity as the  rebels blue eyes  flutter open. Her whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs Circa. \nCIRCA \n\"You\u0092re safe, you\u0092re safe!\" \nEXT. REST STOP \nMORPHEUS charges SMITH.  Smith ignores reloads  him, and sights  in on the exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone  back on the  hook. As  the sights  rest right  between her shoulder blades, Morpheus grabs his gun with both hands. He squeezes off one shot,  the action freeze  back on  an empty  chamber, before  Morpheus throws his hands up in the air \nThe shot ricochets clips Niobe\u0092s ear and ricochets off the booth.  She hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. The phone  rings. She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they fight. \nShe leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight. \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nRAZOR pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen. \nRAZOR \n\"Crazy mothers!\" \nCIRCA has  removed Trinity\u0092s  interface, but  she\u0092s having  a seizure. Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the  cover off a wicked hypo. \nRAZOR \n\"What\u0092s wrong with her?\" \nCIRCA \n\"Her body\u0092s dying but her mind won\u0092t quit.\" \nCIRCA straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest. \n", "test3_true": "Morpheus and  Smith clash  in the  dust -  punches, kicks,  and blocks coming too  fast to  see. Smith  is wailing  on Morpheus, but Morpheus sneaks in a  kick that separates  them. They take  stances a good  two distances away. They\u0092re about to go at it again when: \nNIOBE sprints  into the  fight. Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smith grabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concrete with a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus flies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  of swinging kicks. \nNiobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they  assault the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  capped by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges. He  lands  a punch  into  Niobe\u0092s stomach,  and  her body  folds  over unnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood pouring from her mouth. \nMORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smith\u0092s neck,  smashing  the  agent\u0092s  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the concrete. For a  moment, Smith is  still. Morpheus collects  Niobe and runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing. \nIT\u0092S too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward. Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  and starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus\u0092 face. \nSMITH \n\"I should have killed you the first chance I had.\" \nLike an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final blow. But  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something. He  flips back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second too  slow to  cut the  agent\u0092s head  off. Instead,  it slices  cleanly through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat. \nRAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over Morpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  Smith rolls  backwards, gains his footing, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. He  turns to Morpheus: \nRAZOR \n\"Go!\" \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nRAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed. \nEXT. REST STOP \nHALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to the booth. \nBehind them, Agent Smith backs away from RAZOR\u0092S dual blades, on long, one short. Whenever Razor attacks,  Smith backs away. They circle  one another. \nMORPHEUS puts Niobe through the phone. \nRAZOR forces Smith around. \nRAZOR \n\"Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor.\" \nSMITH frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blade makes him  think twice.  RAZOR holds  the short  sword parallel to the ground, the long sword straight up. He hides his eyes behind the short sword. \nSMITH\u0092s back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud. \nRAZOR flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smith\u0092s eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword. \nSMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks. \nIN the  booth, Niobe  is gone.  MORPHEUS hangs  up the  phone. He  can barely stand up enough to reach the handset. When it rings he picks it up. But he doesn\u0092t disappear. \nMORPHEUS \n\"Reload me.\" \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nCIRCA \n\"All right.\" \nSHE punches  some keys.  MORPHEUS\u0092 3-D  avatar flashes  on a  console, along with a massive array of weapons. \nEXT. BOOTH (MATRIX) - SUNSET \nMORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is  perfectly clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks through  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat. \nRAZOR keeps  swinging at  SMITH -  and missing.  Seeing his chance, he runs back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR when the neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell. \nIN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smith\u0092s outstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes his forearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh. The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off, digging about an inch into his torso. \nSMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. He doesn\u0092t try to get up. \nRAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razor goes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on SMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in a dignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus step into the booth, and replace the phone. \nIt rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith. \nSMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  taking advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy. \nSMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first anger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  He\u0092s lost.  He\u0092ll  be  in  the Matrix forever. \nWith a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the rookie cop. \nTHE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in shock. He focuses on Morpheus. \nThe rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body broken and his mind blown. \nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nCIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair.

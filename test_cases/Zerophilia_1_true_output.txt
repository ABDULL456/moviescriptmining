Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself.   Each time the horror of it grows more intense. 
LUKE Oh, GOD! 
Sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a prescription bottle. 
SYDNEY It's gonna' come back.    Drink this! 
LUKE What're you givin' me?! 
SYDNEY Valium. Flexeril. And a shitload of Darvon. You gotta' calm down. 
LUKE "Caaalm Down?!!!!!!" 
SYDNEY Here we go... 
He and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating MANTRA... 
LUKE "CAAALM DOWN?!!!" 
KEENAN What's wrong with him?! 
SYDNEY He's a Zerophiliac. 
KEENAN A what?! I'm gettin' a doctor! This isn't right! 
Sydney GRABS Keenan, SHOVES him against the wall. 
SYDNEY I am a doctor! You breathe one word, anyone else sees him like this, and he's fucked! Pictures all over the net, tabloids, television! 
LUKE TELE-VISION?!! 
SYDNEY No!  We're gonna' get it back! (to Keenan) You let me help him, he gets a normal body, lives a normal life. Now, you his friend or not?! 
Keenan nods that 'yes, he is.'     Sydney releases him. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Hang onto him. So he doesn't get hurt when he passes out. 
KEENAN Now just wait a sec'?     Is it CONTAGIOUS?! 
SYDNEY There are no recorded incidents of transmission from physical contact. 
KEENAN "Recorded incidents?!!" 
LUKE Oh, PLEASE God!     What did I DO WRONG?! 
SYDNEY Nothing.   You're a Z. 
KEENAN "RECORDED INCIDENTS?!"     Oh my God, I used his deodorant! 
SYDNEY Oh, will you calm down? 
KEENAN "C A L M    D O W N ?!!!" 
LUKE "C A L M    D O W N ?!!!" 
Luke's eyes glaze over... 
He weaves, losing his balance... 
SYDNEY Finally. 
Sydney helps Luke FLOP DOWN on the floor.    He passes out. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) He'll be alright. He didn't go all the way. When you fall asleep or pass out, a Z almost always reverts back. It's called a Nocturnal Remission. 
Keenan approaches Luke, then steps back. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Oh, relax, it's not contagious. 
Keenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig.

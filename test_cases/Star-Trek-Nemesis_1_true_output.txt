PICARD Believe me, Number One; I'm going to find out.  Contact Starfleet Command and inform them of the situation.  I need to know where the hell he came from.  Deanna. 
He goes, Deanna following. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING 
DEANNA I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy.  What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow. 
PICARD Is he sincere about wanting peace? 
DEANNA I don't know. (she stops him) Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than curious about you.  He very much wants to know you. (she looks at him deeply) The same way you want to know him. 
PICARD How could I not? 
DEANNA Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are.  You should resist the urge to think you know him. 
PICARD I not only know him, Deanna, I am him... and he is me! 
He goes. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been working for hours. 
DEANNA Will, you need to rest. (he continues to work) As ship's counselor, I'm recommending you get me sleep. 
Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up her. 
RIKER Some honeymoon. 
She smiles and goes to him. 
DEANNA We have time. (she kisses him) Come to bed. 
She pulls him up. 
RIKER Imzadi, what am I going to do with you? 
They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they fall into the bed. 
It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond. 
She starts back, her eyes growing wide. 
Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon! 
SHINZON Imzadi.  This is so good. 
DEANNA No! 
He caresses her face... 
SHINZON He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you. 
DEANNA This isn't real. 
SHINZON Can you feel my hands... are they real?  Can you feel my lips, my loins? 
He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all? 
Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips: 
SHINZON (V.O.) I'm with you, Imzadi... 
And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her: 
SHINZON I'll always be with you now.  Now and forever... 
DEANNA You sick bastard! 
She pushes him away... 
RIKER Deanna?!  What's with the name calling? 
It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him desperately.

Smith's path has veered him away from Liz's. Frustrated, he's a little lost. His eyes play over the entrance to the lower area, other women, also with umbrellas... 
EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE - SAME 
Martin B waiting in the ticket line at the gates... Gina approaches, breathless. Sees Martin B. Hangs back from the ticket line. Spots a large party of school kids. Gina steps past the line, confidently joins the group... just another parent. Swept through the turnstiles. Behind her, Martin B steps up to the ticket window. 
BACK WITH MARTIN AND LIZ 
MARTIN (CONT'D What are they making you do? Is it about Fahad? 
LIZ I... I can't answer that. 
MARTIN Come with me, right now. We can 
RUN -- 
LIZ No! They'll kill us both! 
MARTIN Who are they? She shakes her head, tormented. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LIZ Please. Not now. Not until we're safe. Then I'll explain everything, I promise. All I want is for us to get out alive. You have to believe me... Urgent look around. Her eyes lock on his. 
LIZ (CONT'D) Your case. 
MARTIN My case...? She closes on him. A wave of emotion as she's almost in his arms, her hands on his face, searching his eyes. 
LIZ Your briefcase. It got left behind. At the airport. That's why you were going back there. You need to find it... 
(CLOSE) In an hour, there's a chance for me to get away. Meet me at the airport at three o'clock. We can run together... Martin's eyes. Mind racing. Eyes suddenly catching GINA, walking right by. Moment's urgent eye contact. The signal. Martin B's here. He's on his way... What can he do? He knows he can't stay. Suddenly, Liz moves her face to his. Kisses him on the lips. Whispers... 
LIZ (CONT'D) I love you. A beat. Martin steps back slowly. Their eyes hold. Then he turns, walks quickly away... 
GINA Behind the glass of the penguin exhibit. She saw the kiss. 
MARTIN Cuts up a small path rising up from the Polar Bear area. At the top he turns, hiding himself, looking back. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- BELOW Smith and Martin B converge from opposite directions on Liz, speak at her, close, heated. Smith pops open his phone. Martin B GLARES at Liz, almost pushing her back against the glass. She GLARES back up at him.

CONTINUED: (2) 
MARTIN .Nothing he can do now. He turns away, moves to the top of the path where Gina waits for him. They walk in silence... 
GINA She's pretty... Martin doesn't acknowledge. Each face a mix of emotions.

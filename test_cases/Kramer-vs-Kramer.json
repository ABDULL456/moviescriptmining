I'd like to know one thing, okay \u0096 just one little thing. Did you tell Joanna she should leave me? \nTHELMA (stiffly) No. \nShe turns and starts toward the front door, Ted at her heel. \nTED Y'know something Thelma \u0096 you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it. Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up. \nTHELMA Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay. (pause) But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did. \nTED I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child? \nCLOSE ON THELMA \nThat stops her dead in her tracks.

BATHROOM \u0096 EARLY MORNING \nAs the child stands in front of the toilet, eyes closed, we HEAR: \nOFF SCREEN Sound-effect: as the child pees noisily. \nThen, when he is finished, he turns and, without bothering to flush the toilet, shuffles down the hall and into his parents' bedroom. \nHIS POV \nThe bed is empty, there is no sign that anyone has slept in it. \nON BILLY \nA look of suspicion on his face, he turns and starts back down the hall toward the living room. \nINT.

Oh God... What time is it? \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nBILLY (suspicious) The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy? \nTED (trying to pull himself together) Oh, Christ... Ah, yeah... you want to know why mom's not here, right? \nBilly nods. \nTED (bullshit) Okay, I'm going to tell you... It's like this. Mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go off by herself for a little while. You know how sometimes you get mad and want to go off and be by yourself? Well, it's like that, okay? Okay.

Very soon. \n", "test1_true": "HIS POV \nThere, on the kitchen cabinet is a box of \"natural grain\" cereal, a jar of honey, some wheat germ, and a banana, with carefully written instructions from Joanna underneath. \nON TED \nHe takes one look at the note, crumples it up and tosses it in the wastebasket. \nTED (the camp counselor) I'll tell you what, kiddo \u0096 why don't I fix us some French toast? \nBILLY (impressed) Wow! French toast, really? \nTED (the camp counselor) Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is... (trying desperately to remember) ...eggs! Right? \nBilly nods. Ted opens the refrigerator and takes some eggs. \nTED This is terrific... isn't this terrific? \nAs Ted begins the process of making French toast, it soon becomes obvious that he has no idea of what he is doing. What follows is a symphony in incompetence on Ted's part. He breaks the eggs into a bowl and ends up with most of the shell mixed up with the egg. \nThen he takes a piece of bread and drops it into bowl. \nTED (saying it will make it so) I'm having a good time... Are you having a good time? \nON BILLY \nWatching all of this with increasing apprehension. \nBILLY You forgot the milk. \nTED (still the camp counselor) That's right. You're absolutely right... It's been a long time since I made French toast. \nTed takes a container of milk, pours it into the bowl so that it is filled to the brim. Then he sloshes the bread around until it is half-dissolved. \nTED Look at this, isn't this something?! \nHe lops off a huge hunk of butter, drops it into an omelet pan and turns up the flame. \nON BILLY \nWatching. He looks as though he is about to throw up. \nBILLY What about my orange juice? \nTED (the counterman) Right. One O.J. coming up. \nHe opens the refrigerator and starts to get the orange juice. As he does, black smoke begins to billow ominously from the frying pan. \nBILLY (scared) Daddy!!! \nTed turns, spots the smoke. \nTED Don't worry... Everything's fine... \nHe lunges for the handle of the frying pan, which by now is very hot. He grabs it, lets out a howl of pain and the whole mess, frying pan, butter, bread, goes crashing to the floor. \nCLOSE ON TED \nSuddenly all the rage comes pouring out. \nTED Goddam! Son of a bitch! \nREACTION \u0096 BILLY \nTerrified. \nWIDE SHOT \nAs Ted kneels down and begins to clean up the mess. \nTED (to himself as much as to Billy) It's okay.

I was a couple of years younger than you are now and... I was staying with this cousin of mine and my parents were supposed to come and pick me up by three, but it got later and later and they didn't and they didn't show up and I remember I got really scared that something had happened to them and I remember when they finally came instead of being happy to see them I was very angry and...

They didn't tell me it was this big. \nTED (apologetically) No... No, actually it's only two bedrooms. \nSECOND WOMAN (sniffing) Phew...

We use the kind in the green and yellow box. \nTED C'mon, there's not much difference \u0096 \nBILLY (firmly) We use the green and yellow. \nTed looks at his son for a moment, then carefully replaces the detergent that he had originally picked and reaches for the green and yellow kind. They continue on for several steps and Ted stops again, this time looking for a dishwashing liquid. He starts to reach for one, stops, looks around at Billy. \nBilly shakes his head. \nTed points to another. \nBILLY (shaking his head again) The pink stuff. \nTed takes a bottle of the pink stuff, puts it in the shopping cart and consults his shopping list. \nTED Okay, what color cereal do we get? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain and buy him an ice. \nON TED \nHe sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took from the office stacked beside him on the bench. Sitting next to him is a personable-looking man of about Ted's age. He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and polished Gucci loafers. We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER. \nNote: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout the film. He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not giving a shit about the child. The Saturday Father insists on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret fraternity. And he comes to represent Ted's nightmare of what might happen to him. \nTED (looking in the direction of the voice) What? \nSATURDAY FATHER Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty minutes. \nTED I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill. \nSATURDAY FATHER Tough... (checking his watch) ...I get off duty at five-thirty. (bored, anxious to make conversation) How long you been divorced? \nTED (surprised) Three months. How can you tell? \nSATURDAY FATHER You've got that look. My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit. First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo. It's pure hell \u0096 if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.

That was what I had in the bank when we got married. \nTED Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry. \nJOANNA Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning. They'll be ready on Saturday. \nTED (hard lining it) Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think - \nJOANNA (not bothering to look up) I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them. \nShe checks off the last item on her list as her husband watches, dumbfounded. \nJOANNA There, that's everything. \nJoanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door.

Would you do me that little favor? \nON JOANNA \nAt the door. \nJOANNA Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.

I really tried but... I just can't hack it anymore... \nTED C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother \u0096 \nJOANNA (from her gut) I am not! I'm a terrible mother!

Several dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents emptied. \nTED Then how come she never said anything like that to me? \nTHELMA Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed. \nTED (stung) Boy, you guys are really something, y'know? I'd like to know one thing, okay \u0096 just one little thing.

I mean it. Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up. \nTHELMA Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay. (pause) But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did. \nTED I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child? \nCLOSE ON THELMA \nThat stops her dead in her tracks. She had always assumed that Joanna took Billy with her when she left. \nTHELMA Joanna left Billy? She didn't take him with her? \nTed shakes his head.

It's like this. Mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go off by herself for a little while. You know how sometimes you get mad and want to go off and be by yourself? Well, it's like that, okay? Okay.

I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine. \nO'CONNOR Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces... You're gonna be okay. \nTED (wishful thinking) I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time. \nO'CONNOR (emphatically) She'll be back... \nTed nods in agreement. There is a beat of silence as both men consider Joanna's imminent return. Then: \nO'CONNOR (trying to be tactful) But... just in case... I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid? \nTED (the wind goes out of him) I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so... Pow \u0096 like that. \nO'CONNOR (a friend having to say something very difficult) Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.

And now it's up to us \u0096 that's you and me \u0096 to deliver the goods.

They didn't tell me it was this big. \nTED (apologetically) No... No, actually it's only two bedrooms. \nSECOND WOMAN (sniffing) Phew...

From time to time when Billy does something particularly difficult, Ted nudges the woman next to him. \nNote: In all of the shots of Billy we SEE the teacher there guiding, helping, over and over and over we cannot help but notice how attractive she is. Toward the end of the show Ted's POV occasionally follows the teacher rather than the child. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWIDE SHOT \nCLOSER ON TED \nAs he realizes this. \nON PHYLLIS \nShe glances up to ask Ted a question about some point or other, notices the direction of his gaze and, unself- consciously buttons up her blouse. \nShe goes back to her papers as Ted continues to watch her. \nON PHYLLIS \nNot looking up from her papers. \nPHYLLIS Yes. \nTED (baffled) Yes, what? \nPHYLLIS (looks up, serious) Yes, I'll have dinner with you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Then, making up her mind, she reaches across, takes Ted's scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp. \nPHYLLIS (in a rush) O'Connor's out to get you. He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you. \nHe reaches across and scrapes most of the sauce off of the meat. \nTED There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger. \nBILLY Some of the brown stuff is still there. \nTED (through clenched teeth) Then eat around it. \nBILLY No. \nTED (anger building) Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table? \nBILLY (obstinate) I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza. \nTED (blowing up) Not on your life. That's it.

Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being! \nBILLY No! \nBy now both of them are out of control. \nTED You want to know something?! You are a spoiled selfish little brat! Now eat \u0096 \nBilly takes his plate and looking his father straight in the eye deliberately overturns it, spilling food everywhere. \nON TED \nHe is out of his chair like a shot, crosses to Billy and jerks him to his feet. \nTED (yelling) Goddamnit! Go to your room! \nHe half-carries, half-drags the child kicking and screaming into his room. THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE THEM. \nBILLY (at the top of his voice) Owwww... You're hurting me... You're hurting me... I hate you... I hate you... \nTED (seething) You're no bargain either, pal. \nBILLY I want my mommy... I want my mommy.. \nBy now they have reached Billy's room. Ted dumps him on the bed unceremoniously and starts out of the room. \nBILLY (sobbing) I want my... mm... ommy... I want mmmy... mommy... \nTED (at the door) Tough shit. You're stuck with me. \nAnd he slams the door behind him. \nCUT TO: \nWIDE SHOT \nThe dining area. Ted sits down and tries to resume his meal alone. \nBILLY (O.S.) (sobbing, fighting to catch his breath) I want my... mmmo... mmmy. I want mmmy mmo... mmy... \nCLOSER IN ON TED \nAs he lifts his glass to take a drink and we can SEE that he is shaking like a leaf. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN \u0096 NIGHT \nON TED \nAs he finishes doing the last of the dishes, dries his hands and looks around to make sure that everything has been put away. He flips off the light and, as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, he walks from room to room, turning off the lights, until he reaches the door to Billy's room which is still closed. Ted hesitates for a moment, then eases open the door and steps inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BILLY'S ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nTED'S POV \nBilly lies sprawled across the bed, all tangled up in the covers. \nON TED \nAs he crosses to the sleeping child and starts to straighten the covers. \nBILLY (tentatively) Daddy? \nTED (all anger gone) Yeah? \nBILLY I'm sorry... \nTED (kisses him) That's okay, pal. Go back to sleep. It's very late. \nHe starts to get up, when: \nBILLY Daddy? \nTED Uh huh? \nBILLY (very quiet) Are you... gonna go... away? \nON TED \nStunned at the question. \nTED Of course I'm not going away. I love you very much. I'll be right here. \nThere is a beat of silence, then: \nBILLY (it comes pouring out) That's why mommy left... isn't it? 'Cause I was bad... \nBILLY Daddy, look! Presenting Billy Kramer's Fantastic Superjet! \nAnd he begins to race around the area, making jet noises and holding the airplane in his hand. \nREVERSE ON TED \nWatching him, smiling. \nON BILLY \nWeaving in and around the benches. He turns and starts back towards Ted. As he does: \nQUICK CUT: INSERT: \nBilly's foot, as he trips. \nON BILLY \nAs he starts to fall, still holding onto the airplane. \nQUICK CUT: TED \nWatching, horrified. \nON BILLY \nAs he hits the concrete. \nON TED \nHe leaps to his feet, starts toward the boy. \nON BILLY \nAs he looks up. \nJUMP CUT IN TO EXTREME CLOSEUP \nThere is a terrible-looking gash running from his cheek into his hairline. \nKim screams at the sight of the blood. \nBILLY (terrified) Daddy! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO CENTRAL PARK \u0096 AFTERNOON \nON THE ENTRANCE \nAs Ted, carrying Billy, wrapped in his coat, comes barreling out of the park, nearly knocking over several people with shopping bags, and begins running like hell WITH THE CAMERA TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF HIM. In the BACKGROUND we SEE Thelma and Kim chasing after him. THE LENGTH OF THE TRACKING SHOT SHOULD BE MUCH LONGER THAN WE EXPECT. IT SHOULD, IN FACT, COVER THE THREE CITY BLOCKS BETWEEN THE KRAMER APARTMENT AND THE HOSPITAL, ACROSS STREETS WITHOUT STOPPING FOR THE LIGHT, ALONG CROWDED SIDEWALKS WITHOUT STOPPING, ENDING FINALLY ON THE EMERGENCY ENTRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL. IT MUST BE GENUINELY SUPERHUMAN, GENUINELY HEROIC. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM, EMERGENCY SECTION, HOSPITAL \u0096 DAY \nON TED KRAMER \nHe is covered with Billy's blood, it is on his face, his shirt, his trousers. At the moment 'he stands helpless, watching as, Off-Screen, a surgeon examines Billy's wound. \nSURGEON (O.S.) (calm, reassuring) That's good, Billy... That's a brave boy... Now then, how's that? Now we've cleaned it out... \nWIDER SHOT \nBilly lies on the examining table with the doctor bending over him. \nSURGEON There. That wasn't so bad, was it? \nBilly doesn't say anything. \nSURGEON Now then, you just wait here, Billy. I want to talk to your dad for a minute. \nThe doctor motions for Thelma to wait with Billy and he crosses to Ted who stands in the doorway. \nCLOSER IN ON THEN \nSURGEON (low voice, again calm and reassuring) Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer. One inch over and it would have caught the eye. \nREACTION TED \nSURGEON But I'm going to have to take some stitches. \nTED (flat) How many? \nSURGEON Ten. \nTed closes his eyes, there is a sharp intake of breath. \nSURGEON Because of the position of the wound and your son's age, I don't think there will be much of a scar. Otherwise I'd call in a plastic surgeon. \nTed nods. \nSURGEON Now, I'd advise you to wait outside. It'll be eas \u0096 \nTED (like a shot) No. \nSURGEON (reasonable) Mr. Kramer, there's \u0096 \nTED (softly, but with real vehemence) Fuck you. He's my son. I'm staying with him. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON TED \nJOANNA'S VOICE Ted? \nTED'S VOICE Joanna? \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT, ISLE OF CAPRI \u0096 NIGHT \nON THE DOOR \nAs Ted enters, looks around. The Maitre d'hotel approaches. From his attitude, it is clear that Ted and Joanna were regular customers. \nMAITRE D'HOTEL Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer, she waits for you in the back. \nTED Thank you, John. \nTHE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he walks toward the back room of the restaurant. Several waiters approach and say hello, the piano player looks up and smiles. As he reaches the door to the back room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACK ROOM \nTED'S POV \u0096 JOANNA \nShe sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of her. \nShe is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. Nevertheless, Joanna is still stunningly beautiful. HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT as she looks up, smiles. \nON TED \nHe stands watching her, his knees weak. It is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again. \nTWO SHOT \nAs he crosses to her table, sits down. \nJOANNA Hello, Ted. You look well. \nTED So do you. \nThe waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda. He sets it down on the table in front of Ted. \nWAITER The usual, Mr. Kramer. \nTED (not taking his eyes off Joanna) Thanks, Gino. \nThe waiter nods and promptly disappears. \nJOANNA How's the new job? \nTED Fine. \nThere is a self-conscious pause. From the bar, the piano player begins playing a new song. From Ted and Joanna's reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past. \nThey listen for a moment, then: \nTED Look at us, Joanna. Just like any old married couple having dinner. Who would believe it. \nJOANNA Yes... How's Billy? \nON TED \nThe question he has been dreading. \nTED He's great... except... (not looking at her) ...Except he had... he fell and he cut his face. He... He has a scar, Joanna, from about here to here. (indicating where and how big) \nThere is a beat of silence. A moment of shared feeling. \nTED (he has to say it to someone) I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault. I keep thinking I could've done something \u0096 stopped it... \nJOANNA You can't tell it from a distance, Ted. \nFor the first time he looks up at her. \nTED What? \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nJOANNA I've seen him. \nTED You have? \nJOANNA A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school. \nON TED \nSpeechless. \nJOANNA He looks like a terrific kid. \nTED He is... (he still can't get over it) You sat in that coffee shop across from school \u0096 \nJOANNA (completing the sentence) Watching my son... Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months. \nTED (amazed) You've been living here, in the city? \nJOANNA (a deep breath) Ted... The reason I wanted to see you... I want Billy back. \nTED You want what?! \nJOANNA (firm) I want my son. I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son. \nTED Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember? \nHe turns and goes out the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OUTER OFFICE, J. WALTER THOMPSON \u0096 LATE AFTERNOON \nThe large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives, researchers, editors, ad-men, etc., etc. They all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on. \nTHE CAMERA TRACKS WITH ACKERMAN as he steps out of his office, closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room to MR. SPENCER, the Advertising Director. At the moment, Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman. Ackerman approaches him, whispers something in his ear. Spencer shakes his head and points to his watch. Ackerman says something else and finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman back to his office. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM. As Ackerman opens the door to his office, THE CAMERA IS ANGLED so that we can SEE past them, into the office where Ted stands waiting. \nACKERMAN (as they enter) Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer. \nSPENCER (not wasting any time) So you're the go-getter. All right, you've got ten minutes. \nAs the door closes behind them, blocking our view, THE CAMERA PANS UP to a clock over the door. It reads five-fifteen. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ACKERMAN'S OFFICE \u0096 LATE AFTERNOON \nON A CLOCK \nWhich now reads five twenty-two. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Spencer, now sitting in Ackerman's chair, his feet on Ackerman's desk. Ted has just finished his pitch. \nSPENCER (sipping his drink) That's very interesting, Mr. Kramer. I must say, it's very interesting. Let me think about it. I'll let Jack... (indicating Ackerman) ...know and he'll get in touch with you. \nSpencer gets to his feet, starts to retrieve his coat. \nON TED \nAs he decides to take a gamble. \nTED Excuse me, I believe you said I had ten minutes. \nON SPENCER \nAlmost at the door, looking around. \nSPENCER Well? \nON TED \nChecking his watch. \nTED That means I've got two minutes left. I understand you're paying twenty- five. \nSpencer nods. \nTED (a deep breath, then a real huckster) All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do \u0096 I'll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that's twenty-five hundred less than you're offering. The only thing is, you have to say yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not after the holidays. It's worth it to me for a yes right now and I'll take twenty-five hundred less. \nThere is a long beat of silence as Spencer and Ackerman look at one another. They were clearly not prepared for this. \nTED (watching them) Today only. One day only. Twenty-two five. \nSPENCER Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately for a moment? \nTED Certainly. \nCUT TO: \nOUTER OFFICE \u0096 LATE AFTERNOON \nON TED \nAs he steps out of Ackerman's office, sits down. Now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up. What if he pushed too hard? What will he do if he doesn't get a job? If Ted Kramer could fall to his knees and pray, he would. \nCROSS-CUT WITH THE CHRISTMAS PARTY \nThat swirls around him. We notice in particular, one very pretty young woman flirting with a number of men. She is wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape. \nFinally the door to Ackerman's office opens and he steps out. \nACKERMAN Mr. Kramer? \nTed jumps to his feet, starts into the office. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ACKERMAN'S OFFICE \u0096 LATE AFTERNOON \nON SPENCER \nHe looks at Ted carefully for a long time, then: \nSPENCER (grins) Welcome aboard, Mr. Kramer. \nCLOSEUP TED \nThere is an instant of relief, then, with astounding cool: \nTED Well, gentlemen, I'm pleased to be with you. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs they shake hands, say their good-byes. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he makes his way through the Christmas party that is still going strong. Then, suddenly, as he passes the very pretty woman we noticed earlier, he turns and kisses her. \nQUICK CUTS \nAs a look passes between them, a sudden chemistry, something we have not seen in Ted before. \nTED (steps back from the astounded girl, grins) Merry Christmas. \nCUT TO: \nJUMP CUT TO: \nWIDER SHOT \nTed stands helpless, watching them leave. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nWIDER SHOT \nTed, now almost lost from view on the crowded street, still hasn't moved. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nWIDE SHOT \nTed and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But as Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is clear that something is wrong. \nTED (he has become an armchair lawyer) So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right? \nPHYLLIS (thoughtful) Right. \nTED But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969 \u0096 in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins. \nPHYLLIS Kramer \u0096 \nTED Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby. \nPHYLLIS Kramer... There's something I ought to tell you. \nTED Yeah? \nPHYLLIS I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W. \nCLOSE ON TED \nHe stops what he is doing, turns to her. \nTED And? \nPHYLLIS (a deep breath) I'm going to take it. \nREACTION \u0096 TED \nHe sits down on the bed. \nPHYLLIS It's a very good job \u0096 too good to pass up. I'll be handling funding for the whole... (she stops, sits beside him on the bed) Look, I... (she means love) ...\"like\" you a lot. And you... (she means love) ...\"like\" me, okay? Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different... \nTED (quiet) But it's not a year from now, is it? \nShe shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him. \nPHYLLIS I'll miss you, Kramer... \nINT. KRAMER APT. \u0096 DAY \nON THE FRONT DOOR \nIt is open and standing in the doorway is an attractive woman, a bit overweight and very serious. This is DR. ALVAREZ, the court appointed psychiatrist. \nALVAREZ Mr. Kramer? \nTED Yes? \nALVAREZ I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet. \nTED Oh, yes. Won't you come in. \nDr. Alvarez enters the apartment. Ted helps her off with her coat. \nALVAREZ Where is the child? \nTED He's in his room, playing. \nALVAREZ Good. I'll see him in there. \nAs Ted carries her coat to the closet, Dr. Alvarez walks into the living room, looks around. \nALVAREZ Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone? \nTED Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one. \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nALVAREZ Does that distress you? \nTED Not particularly. \nALVAREZ What does? \nTED The prospect of losing my child. \nALVAREZ (makes some notes, then:) Very well, I'd like to see him if I may. \nThey cross to the door of Billy's room. Ted opens it. \nINT. BILLY'S ROOM \u0096 DAY \nTHEIR POV \nThe room is a mess, blocks are stacked everywhere. Billy sits in the middle playing with his toys. \nON TED AND DR. ALVAREZ \nJOANNA Yes. \nSHAUNESSY In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way. \nJOANNA No. \nSHAUNESSY Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way? \nJOANNA No. \nSHAUNESSY Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic? \nJOANNA No. \nSHAUNESSY A heavy drinker? \nJOANNA No. \nSHAUNESSY Was he unfaithful? \nJOANNA No. \nSHAUNESSY Did he ever fail to provide for you? \nJOANNA No. \nSHAUNESSY (wry smile) Well, I can certainly understand why you left him. \nGRESSEN Objection. \nSHAUNESSY (switching his line of questioning) How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer? \nJOANNA Permanently. \nNote: During the early part of Shaunessy's cross-examination, Joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself. Now, as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter. \nSHAUNESSY Permanently? (smiles, like a shark smiles) Mrs. Kramer, how many boy friends have you had \u0096 permanently? \nON JOANNA \nHer head snaps back as though she's been hit. \nJOANNA I don't recall. \nSHAUNESSY (boring in) How many lovers have you had \u0096 permanently? \nJOANNA (looks toward Gressen for help) I don't recall. \nSHAUNESSY More than three, less than thirty- three \u0096 permanently? \nON GRESSEN \nHe is again on his feet, outraged. \nGRESSEN Objection! \nJUDGE Overruled. The witness will answer, please. \nJOANNA (almost a whisper) Somewhere in between. \nSHAUNESSY Do you have a lover now? \nGRESSEN (furious) Objection! \nSHAUNESSY (to the judge) Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question. Does she have a lover? \nJUDGE I'll allow that. The witness will answer please. \nJOANNA (in a whisper) Yes. \nSHAUNESSY Is that... permanent? \nJOANNA (by now she is becoming thoroughly rattled) I... I don't know... \nSHAUNESSY Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say \"permanently\" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent. \nON THE PETITIONER'S TABLE \nGressen jumps to his feet. \nGRESSEN Objection! I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness. \nJUDGE Sustained. \nSHAUNESSY (a new attack) Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult? \nGRESSEN (red in the face) Objection! \nJUDGE Sustained. \nSHAUNESSY I'll ask it another way. What was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life \u0096 other than parents and girlfriends? \nJOANNA (rattled) Ah... I guess I'd have to say... with my child. \nSHAUNESSY (wonder, irony) Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life? \nJOANNA (reluctantly) I suppose... \nSHAUNESSY Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you. \nJOANNA (louder) Yes. \nSHAUNESSY How long was that? \nTed sits at the dining table poring over law books, writing copious notes on a legal pad. Billy sits across from him drawing in a pad with magic markers. HOLD FOR A BEAT as Billy looks up at his father. It is clear that something is bothering him. \nBILLY Mom \u0096 I mean, dad? \nTED (not looking up) Uh, huh? \nBILLY What did you do when you were little? \nTED (still involved in his books) I guess about the same kind of things you do. \nBILLY Did you watch \"I Dream of Jeannie?\" \nTED (distracted) Uh, uh... We didn't have television then. \nON BILLY \nEyes wide. He finds this hard to believe. \nBILLY You didn't have T.V.? \nON TED \nHe looks up for the first time, smiles. \nTED Nope. It hadn't been invented yet. \nHe starts to go back to work. \nBILLY (this is serious business) Was there apple juice when you were little? \nTED Yeah, there was apple juice. \nBILLY Was there Burger King? \nTED Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger King. \nBILLY What else wasn't there? \nON TED \nHe takes a long look at his son, then closes the law book, puts his notes away. \nTED Well, let's see... There wasn't McDonald's. And there wasn't astronauts... And there wasn't frozen yogurt. And there wasn't... \nAs he continues on about what wasn't, we \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. COURTHOUSE \u0096 DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT \nINT. COURTROOM \u0096 DAY \nON THELMA \nShe sits in the witness stand being examined by Shaunessy. From her attitude it is clear that she is very wrought up, that all of this is taking a heavy emotional toll on her. \nSHAUNESSY Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer? \nTHELMA Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building. \nSHAUNESSY How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son? \nTHELMA (to the judge, by way of explanation) Charley, my husband, and I are... divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot. So, I guess we see each three or four times a week. \nSHAUNESSY Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son? \nTHELMA It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship. \nON GRESSEN \nGetting wearily to his feet. \nGRESSEN (patronizing) Objection, your honor. The answer is, to be generous, very vague. \nSHAUNESSY Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child? \nTHELMA (fighting a losing battle with her emotions) Ted \u0096 Mr. Kramer, spends a great deal of time with his child. I don't just mean hours, I mean good time, involved time. He reads to Billy. They play together. They talk all the time... (tears start) He is a very... kind man... a very... devoted father, and... and... (she turns to Joanna) And Joanna if you ever saw them together... there wouldn't be a trial at all... (she breaks down, weeping) Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... \nNote: during this we cross-cut to Joanna, who sits, staring at her friend, shaken. \nSHAUNESSY (gently) No further questions. Thank you Mrs. Phillips. \nGRESSEN (without looking up from his notes) No questions. \nThelma leaves the stand and walks back to her seat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM \u0096 DAY \nON TED KRAMER \nSitting in the witness stand. \nSHAUNESSY Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child. \nTED (speaking quietly) When Joanna \u0096 (to the judge, correcting himself) \u0096 my ex-wife \u0096 when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage... Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true. There were a lot of things I didn't understand \u0096 a lot of things I would do different if I could. Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change... But we can't. Some things, once they are done, can't be undone. Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe she does. So do I. But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue. The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy... When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right. But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex? I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy, patience, understanding... love. Where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman? Billy has a home with me, I've tried to make it the best I could. It's not perfect. I'm not a perfect parent. (unconsciously echoing something Joanna said earlier) I don't have enough patience. Sometimes I forget he's just a little kid... But I love him... More than anything in this world I love him. \nSHAUNESSY Thank you, Mr. Kramer. No further questions. \nON GRESSEN \nTED (sarcastic) Yeah, well he did, didn't he. \nJOANNA Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought \u0096 \nTED I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye. \nWIDE SHOT \nAs he turns and walks away from her, leaving her standing, watching him as he disappears. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET \u0096 DAY \nON TED AND THELMA \nIt is a bleak winter's day. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they walk along, Ted carrying a bag of groceries, Thelma with cleaning. \nThe children run around them, playing. \nTHELMA You heard anything yet? \nTED (shakes his head) Any day. \nThey walk in silence for several beats, each clearly lost in their own thoughts. Then: \nTHELMA Ted. \nTED (preoccupied) Uh, huh... \nTHELMA (this is hard to say) Ah, Charley and I are... Well, we're thinking about... I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together. \nTED (thunderstruck) You and Charley? \nThelma nods. \nTED Really? \nThelma nods. \nTED (conflicting emotions) Hey, that's terrific. \nTHELMA (hastily) Maybe. I said maybe. (apologizing for her good fortune) What I mean is, ah... I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so... \nShe leaves the sentence unfinished. They walk in silence for several more steps. Then she takes his hand. \nTHELMA (can't help grinning) Oh, God... Ted, I am really scared. \nThey walk in silence for a beat, then Ted looks OFF SCREEN, spots something: \nHIS POV \nThe Saturday Father, restless, bored, walking with his daughter who is also bored. It is clear that they have nothing to say to one another. He looks around, spots Ted, waves and starts in his direction. \nCLOSEUP TED \nHe reacts as though he has seen a vision of his own death. \nTED (to Thelma, urgent) C'mon. (to Billy and Kim) Billy, Kim. Let's go. \nWIDE SHOT \nAs Ted ushers them across the street, away from the Saturday Father. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEN'S BAR, MIDTOWN \u0096 DAY \nA crowded, rather posh watering spot. Shaunessy sits alone at a table for two, a drink in front of him. \nREVERSE ON THE DOOR \nAs Ted enters, spots Shaunessy and starts in his direction. \nCLOSER ON SHAUNESSY'S TABLE \nAs Ted sits down. \nTED Well? \nON SHAUNESSY \nAs he looks up at Ted, says nothing. \nON TED \nHe realizes that they have lost. \nTED Oh, Christ! \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nSHAUNESSY The judge went for motherhood straight down the line. \nTED I lost him? I lost him? \nSHAUNESSY I can't tell you how sorry I am. \nTED Oh, no.. \nSHAUNESSY (reading from a piece of paper) Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January. That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month. That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period. (looks up at Ted) That's it. \nTED (grim) What if I fight it? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET \u0096 DAY \nON THE SAME MAILBOX \nAs a sack of mail is loaded into a truck. \nTED (V.O.)

BLDG. \u0096 DAY \nWIDE SHOT \nA POSTMAN enters the building carrying a bag of mail. \nTED (V.O.) His best stories have been Babar and Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman moving up. His housekeeper has been Etta Willewska and she is the main reason for the note. She is a loving woman, conscientious, very concerned about Billy and more important, Billy cares about her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY, JOANNA'S APT. BLDG. \u0096 DAY \nON A STACK OF MAIL \nAs it is dropped in front of a doorway. We SEE that the letter from Ted to Joanna is on top. \nTED (V.O.) I urge you to retain her. Her number is 722-8099, and I think she will take the job if it is offered. I'm sure other things will come up. Ask me what you need to and I guess eventually we'll talk... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOANNA'S APT. \u0096 DAY \nON HER \nAs she finishes reading the letter. \nTED (V.O.) That's all I can think of, except to repeat what I said before, he's a terrific kid. I'm grateful for the time we've had together and I feel I am a better man because of my son... Ted. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEACH \u0096 DAY \nIt is a clear, cold beautiful winter's day. Ted and Billy walk \nalong the beach at the edge of the water. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM. There are several beats of silence as Ted tries to think of how to begin. Finally: \nTED Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father. Now there is a man who is very wise. He's called a judge. And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with. \nBILLY Why does he decide? \nTED Because... Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man. \nBILLY Like a principal? \nTED Bigger than a principal. The judge sits in robes in a big chair... The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided... (a deep breath) ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment. (fake cheerful) And I'm very lucky. Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month. \nBILLY I don't understand, daddy. \nTED (trying very hard not to cry) What don't you understand, pal? \nBILLY Where will my bed be, where will I sleep? \nTED At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room. \nBILLY Where will my toys be? \nTED I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones. \nBILLY Who will read me my stories? \nTED Your mom. \nBILLY (worried) Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's? \nTED Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it. \nBILLY Will you come and say good-night to me every night? \nSuddenly Ted can't stand it any longer. \nTED Look, it's getting cold. Why don't you go inside where it's warm. I'll be along in a minute. \nBilly hangs back, watching Ted. \nTED Go on, scoot. \nThe boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house. \nThen, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father. \nHIS POV \u0096 LONG SHOT \nTed stands at the ocean's edge, his back to CAMERA, weeping. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT.

OFFICE \u0096 ADVERTISING AGENCY \u0096 MIDTOWN \u0096 EVENING \nWIDE SHOT \nA large and very comfortable office over-looking St. Patrick's Cathedral. At the moment the office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense. Among the crowd of people we note: MURRAY FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties. She is a lawyer with the agency. \nAt the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds. Clearly he is very distraught. \nTED (predicting the worst) They're not gonna call... I tell you they're not gonna call. I blew it. I don't know what I did wrong, but I \u0096 \nREVERSE ON JIM O'CONNOR \nTed's boss and good friend. He is in his middle fifties, nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker. He sits back in his chair with his feet propped on the desk and a drink in one hand. \nO'CONNOR (not unfriendly) Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat. Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. \nTED (at this stage, nothing will help) I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I shouldn't have \u0096 \nSound-effect: The phone rings. Everyone freezes.

CHILD'S ROOM, KRAMER APT. \u0096 EVENING \nThe room is dark, the only light coming from a small night light. \nWe SEE a beautiful five year old boy (BILLY KRAMER). He lies in bed, half asleep. HOLD FOR A BEAT as a beautiful woman (JOANNA KRAMER) leans over, kisses the child and hugs him tightly to her. \nJOANNA (intense) I love you, Billy... \nBILLY (drowsy) I love you too, mommy... Good-night... \nON JOANNA \nShe gets up from the bed and starts toward the door of the child's room. \nJOANNA Sleep tight... \nBILLY Don't let the bedbugs bite... \nJoanna stops in the doorway, silhouetted against the light. She turns, takes a last look at her son, then steps outside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY \u0096 EVENING \nON JOANNA \nNow that the light is brighter, we can SEE her more clearly. In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A BEAT as she leans against the door. It is clear from her expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase. \nTHE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HER as she carries it into the bedroom, lays it out on the bed and opens it. \nPAN WITH HER as she crosses to a closet, grabs an armload of clothes and dumps them helter-skelter into the suitcase. \nCUT TO: \nINT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE \u0096 EVENING \nIt is a few minutes later, the news has obviously been good because there is a general celebration in progress. \nJim O'Connor, now standing, raises one hand for silence, then making a toast. \nO'CONNOR Here's to Ted Kramer. \nCheers and good-natured jokes. \nO'CONNOR (putting an arm around Ted squeezing him tight) I wanna tell you something about this little runt. He went out there and sold the shit out of Revlon and that's why we got the account. It was his idea, it was his concept, right down the line... \nMore hoots and cheers. People start to yell \"Speech.\" \nTED (embarrassed, but cannot stop grinning) All I can say... All I can say is this is maybe one of the five best days of my whole life... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM \u0096 KRAMER APT. \u0096 EVENING \nJoanna stands at the medicine cabinet, going through it, packing things in a travel kit: rollers, deodorant, makeup, birth control pills. She starts to take a small bottle of perfume that has only an eighth of an inch of fluid left inside, hesitates, then puts it back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE \u0096 EVENING \nNow some time has passed, most of the crowd has gone and only the regulars are left. \nTED (in the middle of a story) So anyway Jim and I are making the pitch, right? And all of a sudden this old guy starts to cough and I keep on going and he keeps on coughing and I keep on going and he keeps on coughing and \u0096 \nMurray Fisher leans over, shakes Ted's hand. \nMURRAY (interrupting) Congratulations, Ted. That was a hell of a job. \nTED (surprised) Where you goin' Murray, it's early? \nMURRAY Got to get home. \nTED (glancing at his watch) Oh, Christ, I'm late... I gotta get out of here. (however, instead of going, he settles back and resumes his story) So anyway, I look over and this old geezer is starting to turn blue and I swear to God the only thing I can think about is that this poor sonofabitch is gonna die on me and screw up the pitch. \n", "test1_true": "INT.

C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks. \nTED Jim, I've got to go. I'm already late \u0096 \nO'CONNOR Listen, Ted... I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty good feeling they'll kick me upstairs... \nHe turns and starts to walk off down the street, Ted, of course, follows. \nO'CONNOR ...and when they do, I just want you to know I'm takin' you along with me. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

BEDROOM \u0096 KRAMER APT. \u0096 NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT \nThe suitcase is now full. Joanna zips it shut and looks around to make sure that she hasn't forgotten anything. \nThen, she hefts her suitcase and starts out of the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOYER \u0096 NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT \nJoanna carries in the suitcase, sets it by the front door, then she crosses to the living room and sits down at the dining table. \nCLOSER IN ON HER \nShe takes out a list made on the back of an old envelope. As she begins to review it, checking off some items: \nOFF SCREEN Sound: A key turning in the lock. \nAs Joanna looks up... \nCUT TO: \nHER POV \nAs the door swings open to reveal Ted Kramer, an enormous grin on his face, a bottle of champagne in his hand. He is so full of himself that he doesn't notice there is anything wrong. \nNote: Throughout the entire scene he carries the bottle of champagne, never putting it down. \nTED I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon. \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nJOANNA (she takes a deep breath, then:) Ted, I'm leaving you. \nTED That represents a gross billing in excess of two million \u0096 (hearing her) What?! \nJoanna opens her purse, takes out her keys and wallet. \nJOANNA Here are my keys. I won't be needing them any more. \nNote: Ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will really leave him. All he can think of right now is that he will have to spend the rest of the evening coping with one of her moods. \nTED (sardonic) I'm sorry I'm late, all right? I'm sorry I didn't call \u0096 I was busy making a living. \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \n", "test2_input": "BILLY (half-asleep) I love you too daddy. \nTed kisses the child, gets to his feet and starts toward the door. \nTED Sleep tight.

I just got word from the guys at Revlon and... ah they did some marketing tests on our campaign and the results were... \nCLOSE ON TED \nHold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is being fired. \nO'CONNOR (stiff) Disappointing.

Well, the guys have decided they want to... ah, re-think the entire concept and... Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But... I mean, what I mean is... ah, I'm going to have to... ah, let you go \u0096 \nTED (not really sure he heard right) Are you firing me, Jim? \nON O'CONNOR \nHe still has his back to Ted. \nO'CONNOR C'mon, Ted, don't get emotional. Okay? (whining) Look, this isn't exactly an easy thing for me to do, y'know? I swear Murray and I did everything we could, but those sons of bitches were out for blood.

INTERVIEW ROOM, EMPLOYMENT AGENCY \u0096 DAY \nWIDE SHOT \nTed sits across from the interviewer, a polished young man in his middle twenties, very efficient, he sounds a bit like a tape recording. \nINTERVIEWER (glancing at a form Ted has filled out) Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm... (the good news) Well, this looks very good.. Of course (the bad news) ...you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job. \nTED (panic) What?! What do you mean, I don't understand. \nINTERVIEWER (patronizing) Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus. \nTED Look, you don't understand. I need a job. I've got a kid and \u0096 \nINTERVIEWER (smooth) I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up... (ending any further discussion) ...after the first of the year. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET \u0096 DAY \nON A TELEPHONE BOOTH \nTed stands inside, talking on the phone. AS THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN CLOSER, he hangs up the receiver and takes the employment section of the New York Times which is filled with listings he has circled and crosses off one.

They've set the court date. I just heard today... It's... (checking his notes) January sixth. \nTED (despair) Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you. My... ah, situation has... changed. I lost my job. \nThere is a long pause, too long. \nTED John? \nSHAUNESSY'S VOICE (thoughtfully) Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work. \nTed doubles over the phone like he has been hit in the stomach. \nTED (softly, but with real feeling) Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life. \nSHAUNESSY'S VOICE Ted? Are you there? \nTED Yeah. \nSHAUNESSY'S VOICE Any prospects? \nTED (trying to make himself believe it) Don't worry. I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John. \nSHAUNESSY'S VOICE (amazed) How the hell are you going to do that? \nTED (grim) I don't know. \nINT. INTERVIEW ROOM \u0096 EMPLOYMENT AGENCY \u0096 DAY \nWIDE SHOT \nThe same young man sits across the desk from Ted. \nINTERVIEWER (smirk) Mis-ter Kramer, as I mentioned yesterday, this is a very bad time of year to look for work. Now I'm sure we'll have something for you by mid-February, March at the latest. \nCLOSE ON TED \nLeaning forward, impatient. \nTED I need a job, now. \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nThe interviewer gives Ted a weary look. Then he starts to flip through the card file. \nINTERVIEWER (going through the motions) No... No... No... \nFinally he pauses at one card, pulls it out. \nINTERVIEWER (doubtfully) There might be something at J. Walter Thompson. But... (shaking his head) ...I don't think they're really serious. The position's been open for two months and... (shrugs) They may just be on a fishing expedition. (cheerful) I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first \u0096 \nTED (checking his watch) Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson. Set up an appointment at four. \nINTERVIEWER (politeness strained almost to the breaking point) Mis-ter Kramer, it's... (checking his watch) ...almost four now. It's the Friday before Christmas. Nobody is going to want to \u0096 \nTED (leaning forward, tough as nails) Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call. And if I call, you lose the commission. \nINTERVIEWER (arch) My, we are a hot shot aren't we? \nTed is already on his feet and halfway out the door. \nTED You bet your ass. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICE ADVERTISING MANAGER, J. WALTER THOMPSON \u0096 LATE AFTERNOON \nIt is dark outside and the lights are on in the office. From beyond the door, we can hear the sounds of a Christmas office party in full swing. \nON JACK ACKERMAN \nThe advertising manager. A balding man in his mid-forties, he wears a suit, complete with vest. At the moment he sits behind his desk listening to Ted's spiel, from time to time he glances at the resume on the desk in front of him. \nTED (O.S.) So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see from my resume, my experience in setting up the leisure package concept means that I've spent a lot of time working along the same lines as your multiple buys and your regional advertising ideas. I know the pitfalls, but \u0096 and this is more important \u0096 I know the potential revenue for the company inherent in these programs. \nON TED \nAs he finishes. He sits back, pleased with himself. \nCROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: \nACKERMAN Well, Mr. Kramer, I must say this has been very impressive. I'd like to think about it and get back to you. \nTED (leaning forward) Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else that I should see before you come to a decision. \nACKERMAN Mr. Spencer, our Advertising Director. \nTED (no time to waste) Could I see him right away? \nACKERMAN (taken aback) I'm sorry, but he's leaving this evening for a two-week vacation. I'll set up something the moment he gets back. \nHe gets to his feet, starts to shake Ted's hand, ready to end the interview. \nTED I'd like to see him now \u0096 before he leaves. \nACKERMAN Mr. Kramer, I don't think \u0096 \nTED (means it) I want this position very much. \nAckerman gives Ted a long, considered look, then: \nACKERMAN Wait here. \n", "test3_input": "TED (pleased) You like it? \nBilly crosses to the window, presses his nose to the glass, looks out. \nBILLY Wow! Is this really where you work? \nTed nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting paperwork to do over the weekend. As he does, Billy goes through the office, sitting in every chair, looking in every drawer. \nBILLY Is this really your desk? \nTED Yep. \nBILLY Is that really your chair? \nTED Uh huh... \nBILLY Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it? \nTED Sure. \nBilly plops himself down in Ted's chair, swivels around. \nBILLY Did mommy ever see this? \nTED No, she never did. \nBILLY Are you going to get remarried? \nTED I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it. \nBILLY Are you going to remarried Phyllis? \nTED (shaking his head) No. \nCLOSE ON BILLY \nThere is a long pause, then: \nBILLY Will you and mommy get remarried? \nTed stops what he is doing, looks across at Billy: \nTED No, son. Daddy and mommy will never get remarried. \nBILLY (looking around Ted's office) Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

COURTHOUSE \u0096 DAY \nWIDE SHOT \nIt is a bleak January morning, the streets around the courthouse are mobbed with people on their way to work. We SEE Ted Kramer, a tiny figure among hundreds, coming out of the subway. He crosses the street and starts up the steps of the large and forbidding courthouse. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTHOUSE \u0096 DAY \n", "test3_true": "As Ted gets off the elevator and starts down the corridor, toward the courtroom. In the f.g., \u0096 standing by the door of the courtroom itself is John Shaunessy, he greets Ted, they shake hands and talk together for a moment. Then, as they enter the courtroom: \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM \nON THE DOOR \nAs Ted enters, looks around. Mrs. Willewska sits in one of the back rows, wearing her best Easter hat. Ted pauses by her, thanks her for coming. \nSeveral rows in front of her is Thelma. Ted crosses to her, they talk quietly between themselves for a few moments. Then Ted moves on to a table at the front of the room where John Shaunessy waits. \nON THE DOORS AT THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM \nAs they swing open and Joanna, along with her lawyer, a MR. GRESSEN. THE CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as they walk to the front of the room and take their seats at the table opposite Ted and his lawyer. \nCLERK Oyez, oyez... The third Circuit Court of the State of New York, Judge Atkins presiding is now in session. All rise... \nWIDE SHOT \nAs the judge enters, takes his seat. \nOpening business of the court. \nWIDE SHOT \nAs Gressen (Joanna's lawyer) gets to his feet. \nGRESSEN Your honor. As our first witness I would like to call Joanna Kramer. \nTWO SHOT \u0096 TED AND SHAUNESSY \nThe lawyer leans across to Ted. \nSHAUNESSY (stage whisper) Real direct. Motherhood... They're going right for the throat. \nWIDE SHOT \nAs Joanna gets to her feet, crosses to the witness stand and is sworn in. \nNote: Throughout the following, we continually CROSS-CUT to Ted Kramer, leaning forward, listening intently. It becomes evident that, in spite of himself, there are moments he feels great compassion for Joanna. \nGRESSEN Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married? \nJOANNA Six years. \nGRESSEN And would you describe those years as happy? \nJOANNA The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult. \nGRESSEN Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband? \nJOANNA No, I did not. \nGRESSEN Did you wish to? \nJOANNA Yes. I tried to talk to Ted \u0096 my ex- husband \u0096 about it, but he wouldn't listen. He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby-sitter for Billy. \nGRESSEN Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time? \nJOANNA Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer. \nGRESSEN And what is your present salary? \nJOANNA I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year. \nREACTION \u0096 TED \nStunned. \nGRESSEN (switching tactics) Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child? \nJOANNA (emphatically) Yes. Very much. \nGRESSEN And yet you chose to leave him? \nThere is a long pause, then: \nJOANNA (speaking carefully, with great thought) Yes... Look, during the last five years we were married, I had... I was getting more and more... unhappy, more and more frustrated. I needed to talk to somebody. I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what. But every time I turned to Ted \u0096 my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it. He became very... I don't know, very threatened. I mean, whenever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack. Anyway, we became more and more separate... more and more isolated from one another. Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex- husband's attitude \u0096 his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self-esteem... (with feeling) At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me \u0096 that my son would be better off without me. It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person. And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother. \nGRESSEN (to the judge) Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California. \nAnd with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick sheaf of papers. Then, turning his attention back to Joanna: \nGRESSEN Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York? \nJOANNA Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father. \nGRESSEN Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody? \nThere is a pause, then: \nJOANNA Because he's my child... Because I love him. I know I left my son, I know that's a terrible thing to do. Believe me, I have to live with that every day of my life. But just because I'm a woman, don't I have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man? Don't I have a right to a life of my own? Is that so awful? Is my pain any less just because I'm a woman? Are my feelings any cheaper? I left my child \u0096 I know there is no excuse for that. But since then, I have gotten help. I have worked hard to become a whole human being. I don't think I should be punished for that. I don't think my son should be punished for that. Billy's only six. He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't need his father, but he needs me more. I'm his mother. \nThere is a beat of silence, then: \nGRESSEN Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. I have no further questions. \nON SHAUNESSY \nAs he stands, collects his papers from the table and, taking his own sweet time, crosses to Joanna. \nSHAUNESSY Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct? \n"}

{"train": "THELMA & LOUISE \n\"THELMA & LOUISE\" \nby \nCallie Khouri \nFinal shooting script \nJUNE 5, 1990 \nFADE IN: \nINT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY) \nLOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early- thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with. \nINT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nTHELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last night's dinner which had to \"soak\".  She is still in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g. \nFrom the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room, an obvious \"do-it- yourself\" attempt by Thelma. \nINT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING \nLouise goes to the pay phone and dials a number. \nINT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nPhone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it. \nTHELMA (hollering) I got it!   Hello. \nINT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING \nLOUISE (at pay phone) I hope you're packed, little housewife, 'cause we are outta her tonight. \nINT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nTHELMA Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go. \nLOUISE (V.O.) You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown. \nThelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of \"101 Ways to Cook Pork.\" \nTHELMA He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work? \nLOUISE (V.O.) No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion. \nTHELMA I'll call you right back. \nThelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister. \nTHELMA Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry up. \nDARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in \"men's\" jewelry.  He manages a Carpeteria. \nDARRYL Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning. \nTHELMA I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late. \nDarryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and \nit's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. \nHe is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair.  Thelma watches approvingly. \nTHELMA Hon. \nDARRYL What. \nTHELMA (she decides not to tell him) Have a good day at work today. \nDARRYL Uh-huh. \nTHELMA Hon? \nDARRYL What?! \nTHELMA You want anything special for dinner? \nDARRYL No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are. \nTHELMA Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend. \nDARRYL Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am. \nHe's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek. \nThey are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun. \nTHELMA Louise, will you take care of the gun? \nLouise shrieks at the sight of it. \nLOUISE Why in hell did you bring that? \nThelma wonders if Louise is really that naive. \nTHELMA Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers, bears... snakes!  I just don't know how to use it.  So will you take care of it? \nLouise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. \nThey are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring. Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC. \nTHELMA Whose place is this again? \nLOUISE It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys. \nTHELMA I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl. \nLOUISE How come he let you go? \nTHELMA 'Cause I didn't ask him. \nLOUISE Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you. \nTHELMA Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what. \nThey are both silent for a minute. \nTHELMA (looking straight ahead) I left him a note.  I left him stuff to microwave. \nAfter a pause. \nTHELMA I guess you haven't heard anything from Jimmy... yet? \nLouise's jaw tightens.  The car speeds up. \nTHELMA ...never mind. \nA huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says: \"Lick you all over -- ten cents.\" \nLOUISE One of your friends? \nThelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette. \nTHELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads \"See you in church on Sunday!\" \nThelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out. Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything. \nINT.  CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nTHELMA How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry. \nLOUISE Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month. \nTHELMA I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes... \nLOUISE We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma. \nTHELMA Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this. \nLouise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in. \nLOUISE Alright, but it's gonna be a quick stop. \nEXT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT \nThey pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.  It's called the SILVER BULLET.  The sign flashes COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.  There is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.  Even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot.  It's already pretty crowded. \nINT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT \nThis place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds all around.  The long bar is filled with customers. \nThere are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke. There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single men.  Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an empty table. \nLOUISE I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas. \nTHELMA Isn't this fun? \nA WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table. \nWAITRESS Y'all wanna drink? \nLOUISE No thanks. \nTHELMA I'll have Wild Turkey straight up and a Coke back, please. \nLOUISE Exactly. \nTHELMA In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some! \nShe again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune. \nPractically the whole place \"whoops\" and heads for the dance floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass, too. \nLATER \nThelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while. Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan is studying her closely.  Louise notices this. \nLOUISE (over the noise) Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road. \nTHELMA (eyes closed, swaying with the music) Ready when you are. \nLouise heads off to the bathroom. \nTHELMA (eyes still closed) Louise, I'm gonna come with you. (she gets a funny look on her face) I don't feel so good. \nShe stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle. \nLouise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her. \nHARLAN (catching Thelma, copping feels) Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you some fresh air, little lady. \nHe steers her towards the door. \nLouise leans against the wall, waiting in line. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nHarlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot. She is pretty limp. \nTHELMA Oh shit. \nHARLAN What's wrong? \nTHELMA Stop. \nHARLAN What for? \nTHELMA I'm spinning. \nINT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT \nThe Waitress is going over to their table.  She picks up Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair. \nShe sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she can see them and walks away. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLouise goes into the bathroom.  She stands in front of the sink and looks at herself in the mirror. \nEXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nThelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but he's right back in there. \nHARLAN How you feelin' now, darlin'? \nHarlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her head away. \nTHELMA I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better. \nHARLAN Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too. \nHe pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her. Thelma pulls away. \nTHELMA (uncomfortable) I think I need to keep walking. \nINT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT \nLouise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in. She scans the room looking for Thelma.  She doesn't see her. She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there. She picks up the check and looks at it. \nEXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nHarlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot. He is trying to kiss her now.  He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away. \nTHELMA Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick. \nHARLAN It's okay.  I'm married, too. \nHarlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder. \nINT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT \nLouise is paying the Waitress.  The Waitress is shaking her head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either. \nThey get onto the interstate going west. \nTRAVELING SHOT FROM BEHIND -- VARIOUS DRIVING SHOTS \nINT.  CAR - NIGHT \nLouise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes the gun off.  Her movements are as if in slow motion.  She puts the gun under the seat.  Thelma is watching her. \nTHELMA Louise. \nLouise does not answer. \nTHELMA Louise.  Where are we going? \nLOUISE (shaking) I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think. \nThelma starts to cry quietly. \nTHELMA Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police. \nLOUISE Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them? \nTHELMA I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened. \nLOUISE Which part? \nTHELMA All of it.  That he tried to rape me. \nLOUISE Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over! \nEXT.  INTERSTATE - NIGHT \nThelma pulls off to the side of the road.  Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car.  She stops when she gets to the back of the car, and she is sick.  Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side.  Louise gets in the driver's side. \nTHELMA Louise... Are you alright? \nLouise rests her head on the steering wheel. \nLOUISE Oh Christ. (to Thelma) Thelma. \nThelma doesn't hear. \nLOUISE Thelma. \nThelma looks at her blankly, without answering. \nLOUISE I've gotta stop for a minute.  I've got to get it together.  I'm gonna find a place to get a cup of coffee and I'm gonna sit down for a second. Do you want to come? \nThelma's head moves almost imperceptibly.  Louise studies Thelma's face. \nLOUISE Is that yes?  Are you up to this? \nAgain, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod.  Louise puts the car in gear and pulls OUT OF SHOT. \nEXT.  TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks. Louise turns to Thelma. \nLOUISE We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means? \nTHELMA Yes. \nLOUISE It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that? \nAgain, she twitches more than nods. \nLOUISE Tell me you understand that. \nThelma nods more firmly now.  She understands. \nVARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee shop.  They look small and incongruous with the surroundings. \nINT.  TRUCK STOP - TIGHT SHOT - WAITRESS' HANDS - 4 A.M. \nslamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter.  REVEAL Louise and Thelma sitting at the counter.  Louise is looking at a map.  The car is parked outside, near the door. \nLOUISE (halfway to herself) We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move. \nTHELMA Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun. \nLOUISE If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now. \nTHELMA Just what is that supposed to mean? \nLOUISE It means shut up, Thelma. \nTHELMA So this is all my fault, is it. \nLouise looks at Thelma for a long time. \nAs she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her hands.  Thelma's not that good at handling money. \nTHELMA Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars. \nLouise has not noticed any of this.  She is so intent on her driving. \nTHELMA I'm cash poor. \nLOUISE Hmmm.  We gotta get some money. \nEXT.  MOTEL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY \nThe motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops. \nINT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.) \nThe curtains are open and we can see the car parked right outside the room.  Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at the ceiling.  Louise is bustling around the room, putting things in drawers. \nTHELMA Why are you unpacking?  You said we were just gonna take a nap. \nLouise did not realize she was doing it. \nLOUISE Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do. \nTHELMA Well, when you figure it out, wake me up. \nLOUISE Just what the hell is wrong with you? \nLouise slams the closet door.  Thelma jumps. \nTHELMA What do you mean? \nLOUISE Why are you actin' like this? \nTHELMA Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off! \nThey are silent for a moment. \nLOUISE You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me. \nTHELMA I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas. \nLOUISE Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ.  I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out... \nTHELMA Give me the keys. \nLOUISE You're not touchin' that car. \nTHELMA My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people. \nLOUISE Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it. \nINT.  POLICE GARAGE - DAY \nHal is at the police station where they're dusting the car with Harlan all over it for prints.  Hal looks closely at the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician over and points it out. \nHAL (pointing) What's that? \nThe I.D. TECH comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders. \nI.D. TECH Blood? \nHAL Whose? \nI.D. TECH His, I guess... \nHal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache. \nHe stares at the guy. \nHAL You guess? \nHal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the area of the black smudge and the drop of blood.  He shakes his head slightly. \nEXT.  MOTEL - DAY \nThelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool. \nShe stops, then decides to go on to the pool.  She lies down in a lounge chair facing the road. \nINT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nLouise in the motel room.  She's looking at the phone.  She picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror. She stares as if she's trying to see into herself, see through herself. \nEXT.  MOTEL POOL - DAY \nThelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately to feel like she's on vacation. \nINT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nJIMMY (V.O.) Call me back. \nLOUISE Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl. \nJIMMY (V.O.) I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay? \nLOUISE Okay. \nEXT.  MOTEL POOL - DAY \nThelma by the pool.  A car SCREECHES, a loud horn HONKS. \nLOUISE (bellowing) Come on, Thelma!  Get in the car! \nThelma bolts upright and grabs her sundress and dashes to the car.  She jumps in over the door.  She's in a mild state of shock. \nTHELMA Did you finish thinking? \nLOUISE I think better when I drive. \nLouise PEELS OUT of the parking lot. \nINT.  POLICE STATION - MAJOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nHal is in the office talking to his superior.  He stands in front of the desk with his hands in his pockets while his MAJOR sits behind the desk looking troubled. \nHAL All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'. \nMAJOR Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back. \nHAL Alright. \nMAJOR Is there any reason to believe they've left the state? \nHAL That's certainly possible. \nMAJOR Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this. \nHAL I have no problem with that. \nMAJOR Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que. \nEXT.  CAR - FARMLAND - DRIVING SHOT - DAY \nINT.  CAR - DAY \nTHELMA Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going? \nLOUISE Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then... \nTHELMA You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him? \nLOUISE No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal. \nTHELMA I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad. \nLOUISE I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years. \nTHELMA Do you think Darryl's having an affair? \nLOUISE I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair. \nTHELMA But you think he fools around. \nLOUISE Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass. Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do. \nTHELMA I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me. \nLOUISE Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time.  Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico. I'm going.  Are you coming with me? \nThelma is staring down the road.  She does not answer.  Then: \nTHELMA I think he does.  Fool around. \nEXT.  CAR - FARMLAND - DRIVING SHOT - DAY \nINT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nTIGHT SHOT of an \"indent-a-kit\" likeness of Louise.  On a table nearby lies a drawing strongly resembling Thelma. \nLena, the waitress, sits next to the plain-clothes cop who holds the indent-a-kit.  Hal picks up the drawing and studies it closely. \nEXT.  SMALL COUNTRY TOWN - DAY \nThe T-Bird rolls into town. \nEXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY \nLouise and Thelma pull up in front of an old store, the kind with a wooden front porch, the kind that sells bait and flannel shirts.  They enter the store and see an OLD MAN behind the counter. \nLouise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo. \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY \nTHELMA Honey? \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nDarryl in the den of their house.  The room is a mess. \nThere are beer cans everywhere.  The large screen TV is ON, showing a FOOTBALL GAME.  Darryl is in a recliner.  He is wearing loud shorts, a V-necked T-shirt, and a couple of necklaces and bracelets. \nDARRYL Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam Hill are you?! \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY \nTHELMA I'm... I'm with Louise.  We're in the mountains, we're... \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nDARRYL (interrupting) What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Have you lost your goddamn mind?!  Is that it?  I leave for work and you take complete leave of your senses? \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY \nTHELMA Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down now, honey.  Please don't get so mad.  I can explain... \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nDarryl is mad, but he's still watching the game. \nDARRYL Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit. \nHe covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where \"his team\" fumbles the ball.  This only makes him madder.  He puts the phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say: \nTHELMA (V.O.) ...only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night. \nDARRYL No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me? \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY \nThelma is trying not to cry.  She's trying to be strong. \nTHELMA Darryl, please... You're my husband, not my father, Darryl. \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nDARRYL (interrupting) That does it!  That Louise is nothin' but a bad influence.  If you're not back here tonight, Goddamnit, Thelma... well, I just don't wanna say... \nNeither one of them say anything for a moment. \nDARRYL Thelma? \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - DAY \nTHELMA Darryl. \nDARRYL (V.O.) What? \nTHELMA Go fuck yourself. \nShe hangs up on him. \nEXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY \nThelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car.  So she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see. \nBoth people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision. \nHITCHHIKER Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you alright? \nThelma nods her head \"yes,\" but tears continue.  Her crying is silent. \nHITCHHIKER Is there anything I can do? \nThelma shakes her head \"no.\" She tries to control her tears. She notices how blue his eyes are. \nTHELMA No.  Thanks.  Sorry. \nTHELMA \ncollects herself as she walks back to the car.  She gets in and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.  In the mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the side of the building.  He is several feet behind the car, and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and stuffs it into his duffel bag.  Now he is just in T-shirt and jeans.  He looks good.  Really good.  She watches in the mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road. She can see him as he's walking.  He stops.  He's thinking. He heads over to the car. \nHITCHHIKER Would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going?  I'm trying to get back to school and my ride fell through, so I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my way? \nThelma doesn't know what to do. \nTHELMA Umm.  I think we're going to Oklahoma City.  But I'm not sure. \nHITCHHIKER Do you think you could... I mean, I could help pay for gas. \nJIMMY Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble. \nLouise just looks at him for a minute. \nLOUISE Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what the trouble is.  Someday soon you'll understand why I can't.  But I won't tell ya, so don't ask me. \nJimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is. \nJIMMY (almost at a loss for words) Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing? \nLOUISE Maybe. \nJIMMY Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him? \nLOUISE It's nothin' like that. \nJIMMY (exploding) Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise! Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever? What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?! \nLouise spills her champagne. \nLOUISE Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'! \nJIMMY (calming down) Alright, alright.  I'm sorry. \nThey both take a second to regain their composure. \nJIMMY Can I just ask you one other thing? \nLOUISE Maybe. \nJimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket. \nJIMMY Will you wear this? \nHe hands Louise the box.  She opens it and it is a diamond ring.  Louise is flabbergasted. \nJIMMY Will you at least see how it fits? \nLOUISE Jimmy... it's beautiful! \nJIMMY You didn't see that one comin', did ya? \nINT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJ.D. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still undone and no shirt.  He has an incredible physique.  He also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety. Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7- Up.  She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror.  He definitely looks better with his shirt off. \nShe suddenly feels awkward and stands up. \nTHELMA You wanna drink? \nINT.  JIMMY'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nLouise has the engagement ring on her finger.  It's really beautiful. \nJIMMY So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right? \nLOUISE Why now, Jimmy? \nJIMMY (this is hard for him) 'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently. \nLouise doesn't know how to respond.  She struggles for a reply. \nLOUISE Jimmy, we've gone all these years... we never made it work.  We're not gonna be able to just... I'm not... What kind of job, honey?  Can you see it.  I can't. \nJimmy doesn't answer right away.  He's trying to see it. \nJIMMY I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do. \nLOUISE I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse. \nJimmy does not really understand why this is happening. \nJIMMY Are you just doin' this to punish me? \nLOUISE Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished. \nINT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge of the bed.  She walks over and hands it to him and as she does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the other.  He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds her hand with both of his.  He closely studies her wedding ring.  He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as intently.  He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring as if to say, \"This is not right for you.  This isn't going to work.\"  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink. He drops it in.  He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to say, \"There.  Now don't you feel better?\"  He smartly kisses her hand. \nINT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLouise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed. \nJimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his.  They both ponder it. \nJIMMY It does look good. \nINT.  THELMA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nINT.  SIESTA COFFEE SHOP - DAWN \nTIGHT SHOT of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee pot.  Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the same side.  They are both playing with their wedding rings. \nJIMMY Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is. \nLOUISE Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff? \nJIMMY I'm choking on it. \nThey sit for a minute. \nJIMMY Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to come with you? \nThey look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see that Louise is already gone.  Louise is really touched that he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is very kind to him. \nLOUISE Oh... now... it's probably not such a good idea right now.  I'll... catch up with you later, on down the road. \nIn her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box. She puts it on the table and slides it back to him.  He stops her, suddenly.  He covers her hand with his. \nJIMMY You keep this! \nJimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still. A taxi pulls up outside. \nLOUISE Your taxi's here. \nJimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at his watch. \nJIMMY Are you happy, Louise?  I just want you to be happy. \nLouise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand. \nLOUISE I'm happy, sweetie.  Happy as I can be. \nJimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup. \nWAITRESS Good thing he left when he did.  We thought we were gonna have to put out a fire. \nThe Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too.  Louise waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks at her.  She smiles to herself. \nINT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nThe room is totally trashed.  J.D. and Thelma are both asleep, naked and hanging off either side of the bed. \nJ.D. starts to stir... \nINT.  HAL'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nHal is in bed with is WIFE.  He has to get up.  He is holding his wife in his arms. \nHAL Honey? \nSARAH Yes, baby? \nHAL Do you think you could ever shoot someone? \nSARAH What? \nHAL Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone? \nSARAH I could shoot your cousin Eddie. \nHAL Why? \nSARAH Because he's an inconsiderate asshole. \nHAL I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger? \nSARAH I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend. \nHAL On what? \nSARAH (trying to picture it) Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children. \nHAL Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say... \nSARAH Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan. \nHAL That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range? \nSARAH (thinking) In the leg. \nHAL (getting up) I gotta go to Little Rock. \nINT.  COFFEE SHOP - MORNING \nLouise is sitting in the booth by herself.  Thelma comes hurrying by.  She looks disheveled but is grinning like an idiot.  She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop. \nHer energy and volume is several notches higher than the rest of the people in the coffee shop.  There are a couple more customers in there now.  Thelma slides into the booth seated directly across from Louise. \nTIGHT SHOT of rear wheel of green T-Bird LAYING RUBBER out of the motel parking lot.  Thelma and Louise, both looking a little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away. \nEXT.

THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY \nPolice are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull expression on his face. \nHAL (to Darryl) As you know, we've tapped your phone. In the event that she calls in. \nMax comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway. \nMAX We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them. \nHAL The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her? \nDARRYL Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as close as I can be with a nut case like that. \nMAX Well, if she calls, just be gentle. Like you're happy to hear from her. You know, like you really miss her. Women love that shit. \nEXT.  CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY \nThelma and Louise are sitting in the car.  They've put all their money together. \nLOUISE Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl. \nTHELMA (getting out of the car) Don't worry about it.  You want anything? \nLOUISE No. \nThelma marches off to the store.  Louise puts a tape in the deck and is listening to loud R&B MUSIC.  She checks herself in the rearview mirror.  She takes her lipstick out and is about to put it on.  She makes eye contact with herself and, instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans her head back on the seat.  She's in a world of shit. \nThelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the car. \nTHELMA (breathless) Drive! \nLouise looks at her. \nTHELMA Drive!  Drive away! \nLOUISE (driving away) What happened? \nThelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills. \nLOUISE What?  You robbed the store?  You robbed the Goddamn store?! \nThelma shrieks with excitement.  Louise is completely stunned. \nTHELMA Well!  We needed the money!  It's not like I killed anybody, for God's sake. \nLouise shoots her a look.  She puts the car in gear and FLOORS it out of the parking lot.  She is still looking at Thelma as if she has completely lost her mind. \nTHELMA I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it. \nLOUISE Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit! \nTHELMA (sternly) Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya! \nLOUISE Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say? \nTHELMA Well, I just... \nINT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nHal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV plays back VCR TAPE of Thelma in the convenience store pulling a gun.  In perfect lip sync is: \nTHELMA (V.O.) Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's see who'll win the prize for keepin' their cool.  Everybody lie down on the floor.  If nobody loses their head, then nobody loses their head... \nTIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock.  TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, etc., all looking intently at the screen. \nVIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her purse with money.  As he's loading the purse with bills, she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier. \nTHELMA (V.O.) (videotape playback) You, sir... You do the honors.  Just empty that cash into this bag and you'll have an amazing story to tell all your friends.  If not, you'll have a tag on your toe.  You decide. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CAR - DAY \nThelma and Louise in car, driving. \nLOUISE (incredulous) Holy shit. \nCUT TO: \nLOUISE Litterbug. \nThey come ROARING up on a semi-tanker carrying gas.  We see their FISH-EYE REFLECTIONS in the shiny tanker. \nThe mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that Thelma and Louise saw earlier.  The truck is going slower than they are. \nLOUISE Aw, great.  This always happens. Whenever you're in a hurry. \nShe noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car coming.  The car passes and the truck HONKS.  The truck driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past. \nTHELMA Isn't that nice?  Truck drivers are always so nice.  The best drivers on the road. \nAs they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling and waving at them.  They smile and wave back.  He flicks his tongue at them.  Louise screams. \nTHELMA/LOUISE Ugh!!  Gross!!  Oh my God!  Aw, God! \nLouise FLOORS it and speeds past him. \nTHELMA Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that? \nLOUISE They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on. \nLouise shivers with disgust. \nINT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nJimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys. Hal shows Jimmy a mug shot of J.D. \nHAL Is this the guy you saw them with? \nJIMMY (looking closely) It's him. \nMAX (clapping his hands) Oh, happy day. \nJIMMY You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked up a murderer?! \nHAL Armed robber. \nJIMMY Oh, great. \nMAX (to Hal) They're flying him here right now. He was picked up this morning for parole violation.  They also found about six grand on him, so he probably knocked over something while he was out there.  They can drop him by here for questioning.  I'm so happy. \nJIMMY (overhearing) How much cash did he have? \nEXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY \nJ.D. arriving, handcuffed, at State Police building. \nEXT.

CAR - DAY \nLOUISE Thelma. \nTHELMA Yeah. \nLOUISE I want you to call Darryl. \nTHELMA What for? \nLOUISE To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped. \nTHELMA Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so? \nLOUISE (agitated) Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma! \nTHELMA Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense? \nLOUISE But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away! \nTHELMA They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth! \nLOUISE It won't work. \nTHELMA Why not?! \nLOUISE No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now. \nThey both pause for a moment. \nTHELMA God.  The law is some tricky shit, isn't it? \nThen: \nTHELMA How do you know 'bout all this stuff anyway? \nLouise does not answer the question. \nLOUISE (V.O.) Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico. \nTHELMA (V.O.) I always wanted to see New Mexico. \nEXT.  THELMA'S POV - OUT PASSENGER WINDOW - PITCH BLACK \nEXT.  BACK ROAD - NIGHT \nThe car goes streaking by. \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT) \nAll's quiet.  The large screen TV is ON and the room is filled with dense smoke.

JIMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJimmy sits on his couch with his guitar while two plainclothes cops sit reading the paper, doing the crossword puzzle. \nINT.  CAR - NIGHT \nOver music from tape: \nThelma is sipping on a little Wild Turkey. \nTHELMA Now what? \nLOUISE Now what what? \nTHELMA Whaddo we do? \nLOUISE Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards. \nTHELMA I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me. \nLouise speeds up. \nThelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she drinks it down.  Thelma has one too. \nTHELMA Can I ask you kind of a weird question? \nLOUISE Yeah. \nTHELMA Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most? \nLOUISE You mean now or before? \nTHELMA Before. \nLOUISE I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs. \nTHELMA What little dogs? \nLOUISE You know those little dogs you see people with? \nTHELMA Like a Chihuahua? \nLOUISE Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth? \nTHELMA Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos. \nLOUISE Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you? \nTHELMA Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me. \nLOUISE I can see that. \nTHELMA I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. (quieter) I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it. \nLOUISE Well, now, maybe you won't have to. \nTHELMA Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya? \nEXT.

Thelma, wake up!  Shit!  We're gettin' pulled over! \nThelma jumps awake. \nTHELMA What!  What!  Oh shit!  Oh no! \nThey are trying not to panic.  They are slowing down, but still doing 70 mph.  The patrol car is right behind them. \nTHELMA What do we do?  What do you want to do?! \nLOUISE I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket. \nTHELMA Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please... \nLouise pulls the car off the road.  The patrol car pulls up right behind them.  The lights shine brightly in through the windows. \nEXT.  SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY \nPATROLMAN (O.S.) Turn off your engine. \nLouise does.  The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches their car.  He comes to the driver's side window.  It is rolled up. \nPATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him.  He gestures to her to roll her window down.  She does. \nLOUISE Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem? \nPATROLMAN You wanna let me see your license, please? \nLouise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and shows her license. \nPATROLMAN You wanna take it out of your wallet, please? \nLOUISE Oh yeah. \nShe does and hands it to him. \nTHELMA I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down. \nLOUISE About how fast was I going? \nPATROLMAN About a hundred and ten.  You wanna step out of the car, please? \nThey walk to the back of the car.  He notes the license plate number. \nPATROLMAN Is this your car? \nLOUISE Yes. \nPATROLMAN You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please. \nLOUISE In the back? \nPATROLMAN Front. \nLOUISE Am I in trouble? \nPATROLMAN As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are. \nPatrolman gets in the driver's side.  He picks up a clipboard and clips Louise's driver's license to it.  He picks up the hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun comes in his car window.  It's Thelma and she puts the gun to his head. \nTHELMA Officer, I am so sorry about this. Could you let go of that? \nHe drops it. \nTHELMA I really, really apologize, but please put your hands on the steering wheel. See, if you get on that radio, you're gonna find out that we're wanted in two states and probably considered armed and dangerous, at least I am, then our whole plan would be shot to hell.  Louise, take his gun. \nLouise reaches over and takes his gun. \nLOUISE (apologetic) I am really sorry about this. \nTHELMA I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please? (she opens the door for him) You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio. \nLOUISE What? \nTHELMA Shoot the radio! \nLouise SHOOTS the car radio.  The cop flinches with each shot. \nTHELMA The police radio, Louise!  Jesus! \nLouise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio.  It BLASTS all to hell. \nLOUISE And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach. \nTHELMA Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila? \nLOUISE You do? \nTHELMA Yeah, you want it? \nLOUISE Yeah. \nThelma starts to dig through her bag again. \nTHELMA It's in here somewhere. \nLouise is rubbing her face.  She looks pretty bad.  Her hands are shaking. \nLOUISE Shit.  I'm gettin' tired. \nTHELMA Are you alright? \nLouise does not really seem alright. \nLOUISE I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police. \nTHELMA You know why.  You already said. \nLOUISE What'd I say again? \nTHELMA Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else? \nLOUISE What? \nTHELMA That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass. \nLOUISE I said all that? \nTHELMA No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest. \nLOUISE (tired) Whatever. \nEXT.

Louise, I almost feel like I know you. \nLOUISE (V.O.) Well.  You don't. \nHAL You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone. \nLOUISE (V.O.) Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident? \nHAL I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here. \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING \nLouise does not answer. \nHAL (V.O.)

I wanna work at Club Med. \nLOUISE Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that? \nTHELMA It'd have to be pretty good. \nLOUISE It would have to be pretty damn good. \nThey are both laughing.  The car is still flying down the road.  The sun is coming higher in the sky now.  They come to an intersection in the middle of nowhere.  Louise stops and looks at the map. \nLOUISE We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.

More police cars have joined, and from every direction, police cars are swarming across the desert, although none are in front of them.  Way off in the distance, a helicopter joins the chase. \nINT.  CAR - DAY \nThelma is looking way up ahead in the distance. \nTHELMA Louise! \nLOUISE What?! \nTHELMA What in the hell is that up there? \nLOUISE Where?! \nTHELMA Way up ahead! \nLouise strains to see.

Finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and Louise SLAMS on the brakes. \nThelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up. The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind them.  The dust from the cars is blowing across them.  They just sit looking at the Grand Canyon. \nFrom the canyon, the FBI helicopter rises up in front of the car. \nINT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY \nHal sees Thelma and Louise for the first time.  They are sitting in the car, oblivious in a way, to all the activity around them.  He only takes his eyes off of them long enough to look at Max. \nINT.  CAR - DAY \nTHELMA God!

Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em! \nMAX The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'. \nMax climbs out of the chopper.  Hal sits for a moment and then leaps out and follows Max. \nPOLICE (O.S.) (over loudspeaker) This is the Arizona Highway Patrol.

I wish you could meet him. \nJ.D. Did you get married real young? \nTHELMA Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl. \nJ.D. Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole. \nTHELMA It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide. \nJ.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance. \nJ.D. Better slow down.  That's a cop. \nLouise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car coming down the road towards them.  She does not look alarmed but veers off the road into a \"rest area\" drive that has trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road. \nShe glides along as the cop car passes on the other side without seeing them. \nLouise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual has happened at all.  They realize they have not been spotted. J.D. and Louise look at each other. \nJ.D.

MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT \nAn older WOMAN behind the counter is looking at a computer screen. \nLOUISE Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.  Are you sure? \nWOMAN Nothin'.

You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here? \nJIMMY (to Woman) Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card. \nThe Woman hands them a key. \nWOMAN 'Round to the back. \nEXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nLouise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very close to J.D.  Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat to the other side of the car.  She tries to look nonchalant. \nTHELMA Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here? \nJIMMY Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. \nTHELMA Good answer.  Same goes double for me. \nJIMMY Who's your friend? \nJ.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable. \nTHELMA This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here. Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go.  And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.? \nJ.D. Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care. \nHe quickly turns and walks away toward the road. \nTHELMA (watching him) Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go. \nLOUISE (to Jimmy) Thelma kinda took to him. \nJimmy is smiling. \nJIMMY (to Thelma) Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can go on in and take a nice cold shower. \nTHELMA Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman. \nJIMMY I always knew that. \nTHELMA A regular outlaw. \nLouise shoots Thelma a look.  The three of them drive around to the back of the motel.  Thelma turns and looks at the road.  J.D. is standing there.  He blows her a kiss. \nEXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThey stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them climb out of the car. \nLOUISE Let me just go in and freshen up for a minute.  I need to wash my face, you know. \nThelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk. \nJIMMY Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush you.  I just wanna talk to you and... (whispering) ...be alone with you.  I'll just be in my room, 115, you just come on down when you're ready. \nJimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.  He stops at the door. \nJIMMY I'll be waiting. \nLouise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe he's acting this way.  He turns on his heel and slinks away. \nTHELMA I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad. \nLOUISE He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away. \nTHELMA I heard that. \nINT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThey close the door to their room.  Louise sets the envelope of money on the table. \nLOUISE (indicating envelope) Our future. \nLouise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup. \nShe stands very close to the mirror.  She is putting on lip liner.  Thelma is watching. \nTHELMA So what are you gonna tell him? \nLOUISE Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is. \nTHELMA You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man. \n", "test2_true": "LOUISE I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase. \nTHELMA Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he? \nLOUISE Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115. \nTHELMA I won't wait up. \nLouise turns to face Thelma. \nLOUISE How do I look? \nTHELMA You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are. \nLOUISE Have another drink, Thelma. \nLouise walks out the door. \nTHELMA Good idea. \nEXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's raining out.  Louise goes to Jimmy's room. \nLouise knocks on the door to room 115.  The door opens slightly and one red rose pops out. \nLOUISE Hello... \nJIMMY (in a falsetto voice) Who is it? \nLOUISE It's me. \nThe following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with LAUGHTER. \nINT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING \nThelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a T- shirt.  Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she did when she arrived.  Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses.  There is a KNOCK on the door.  She stops what she is doing and is completely still. \nTHELMA Louise? \nAnother KNOCK. \nTHELMA Louise, is that you? \nJ.D. (O.S.) (through the door) Thelma?  It's me. \nThelma opens the door and there stands J.D., soaking wet from the rain pouring down behind him. \nJ.D. I just thought I... I know I'm supposed to be gone, but... \nHe's kind of looking over towards the road.  He's still slightly shy. \nJ.D. I'm not havin' much luck gettin' a ride. \nHe notices looking past her into the room that Louise isn't there.  Thelma just stands there looking at him. \nJ.D. Well, I guess I'd better... \nTHELMA Wait...!  Um, where ya going? \nJ.D. I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'? \nTHELMA I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower. \nJ.D. That sounds nice. \nTHELMA Well, you wanna use the shower? \nYou can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so. \nSo instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin on his face. \nJ.D. Oh.  I... where's Louise? \nTHELMA She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend. \nJ.D. That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely. \nThelma pretends like she's had a lot of experience with this sort of thing. \nTHELMA (letting him in the door) Oh, yes, well, they can be. \nINT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy is pouring champagne into Louise's glass.  There are a dozen roses in a vase on the table.  He pours for himself as he sits as close to Louise as possible. \nJIMMY Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything. \nLOUISE (cringing) Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that... \n", "test2_id": 1009, "test3_input": "Darryl is sitting in the hallway.  Hal comes out of the room first. \nHAL Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang on, I want a word with you and then we'll take you home. \nPolice officers lead J.D. out of the interrogation room, down the hallway.  Darryl is watching J.D. closely.  J.D. is smirking at him. \nJ.D.

If you think he knows, even if you're not sure, hang up. \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe TV is ON and the place is a mess. \nDarryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the phone RINGS, putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders. Darryl picks up the phone. \nDARRYL Hello. \nEXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT \nTHELMA Darryl.  It's me. \nINT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nHal, Max, etc., all are gesticulating wildly. \nDARRYL (real friendly) Thelma!  Hello! \nEXT.

I... \nLOUISE You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?! \nLouise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door and fires up the ENGINE.

Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit! \nLouise careens back onto the road. \nTHELMA I'm sorry.  I mean I... \nLouise slams on the brakes. \nLOUISE Goddamnit, Thelma!  Let me explain something to you.  Right now we have only two things goin' for us.  One, nobody knows where we are, and two, nobody knows where we're going. Now, one of our things that was going for us is gone! \nLouise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control. Thelma looks pitiful. \nLOUISE Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma!

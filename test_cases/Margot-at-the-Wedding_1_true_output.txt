MARGOT I have that. I blank out on certain words now too. Like the other day, I couldn't remember the word for... (laughs) I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine. Sediment! That was it. 
MALCOLM I know that. I was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for Motley Cr√ºe. Malcolm lights up a cigarette.   He offers one to Claude who shakes his head, No. 
PAULINE Ingrid, why don't you show Claude and Bruce the game trunk. 
INGRID Okay. 
Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce.      He looks back longingly at the table of adults. 
MALCOLM (relieved, to himself) Mick Mars. 
MARGOT Toby, I think you need to have Bruce diagnosed. 
TOBY Margot, I don't want to have this conversation with you. 
We follow the kids inside.   We hear in the background: 
MARGOT It's vital. If you keep telling him he's like everyone else he'll wonder why he isn't. He's suffering. 
TOBY He's tested very well.    He does B's in school. 
Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the window. Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no connection -- she goes back to Toby. 
MARGOT But, that's how autism works. One part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged. ALAN We had him diagnosed, Margot. Nothing was found wrong. MARGOT Did you really, though? TOBY I'm...I'm not going to have this conversation. I'm sorry. 
Silence. 
MARGOT I know it must be so difficult for you, but I think you have to -- 
13   INT. KITCHEN - SAME                                          13 
Pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter.   She hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath. 
14   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           14 
Margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb garden. She drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a joint. The bottle lies at her feet, three-quarters empty. 
JIM'S VOICE What are you doing? 
MARGOT I left you a note. 
JIM'S VOICE Come back. Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday. 
MARGOT No...no. The wedding is on Saturday. I'm here for that. I can't really pull out. How would that look? 
JIM'S VOICE You haven't spoken to her in years - 
MARGOT Well, we're speaking now. She is my closest friend despite it all... You're the one who's been trying to get me to call her. JIM'S VOICE Did you tell Claude what you're doing? MARGOT (suddenly laughing) Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's exactly what you'd imagine except I think he's clinically depressed. (MORE) 
MARGOT (CONT'D) Not ugly, but completely unattractive. And he has no job. The best I can make out is that he's a letter writer. I don't know, the house looks weird to me...she's trying too hard and it's kind of a mess...they took down the swing... 
Silence on the other end. 
MARGOT Hello? 
JIM'S VOICE You said you weren't a hundred percent on this. You said that like a week ago. Can I come up there? 
MARGOT No. I don't want to see you -- I feel happier already having done it. 
JIM'S VOICE Really? You feel happier... (silence) Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more. 
MARGOT I need to tell him. And we need to tell Josh. Did he do his homework?

GUY Asshole who ran us off the road. 
She's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now. She turns to look, puzzled. 
There's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere. They're alone. 
GIRL I don't know. I guess maybe he decided just to hit and run. 
GUY So where are his tire tracks? 
She looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow. 
GIRL In case you haven't noticed, it's coming down pretty hard. 
GUY (points) Yeah, but you can still see our tracks. 
The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus. 
She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be. 
GUY (cont'd) What the hell?! 
He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank). He begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight.

ANGLE ON HER 
Deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it. 
She looks back down the long dark road. 
Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile. 
Too risky. 
Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself. 
No tracks. 
Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints. 
GIRL (to herself) This doesn't make any sense... 
At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings. 
The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice. 
He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs. 
GUY (calling) HELLO! 
She jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled. 
GUY (cont'd) (calling) ANYBODY OUT THERE!? ANYONE?! HEY! 
His voice is swallowed by the dark. After the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and a weird otherworldly HUM. 
He snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket. 
GIRL What now?

GUY I guess we see how bad we're stuck. 
They trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow. 
GUY (cont'd) You steer, I'll push. 
He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat. He leaves the door open so they can communicate. 
He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile. 
He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside. 
Little wooden crosses. 
Just two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606. 
Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him. 
GIRL (calling) Ready?

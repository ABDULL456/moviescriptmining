Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on one of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watching the expressionless figure as it counts the money. 
There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear muffled noises of frustration from under the mask. Something that sounds like a low, angry scream. 
Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall. 
EXT. GAS STATION 
Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas station. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards it. We transition to... 
FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS. 
Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio. 
We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station store. 
INT. GAS STATION 
The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store. Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who says something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown out of frame. After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter, and floats over to Andrew. 
Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him; as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. He goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun. 
EXT. GAS STATION 
Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells, raising the shotgun. Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as he's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild, striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage. 
The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down. 
FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA. 
The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING. 
It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays motionless, burning. 
The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is horribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on the ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt. 
Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces himself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fire on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump. 
The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station. 
The camera is spun violently out into the street- 
VIOLENT DISTORTION AND CRASH TO BLACK. 
FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat distorted audio. The image is a little blown out. 
Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutely scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper, blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged are already soaked through with blood. 
He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines. Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensured by the handcuff on his left wrist. 
The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the other side of the door. 
MR. DETMER -come down to the city, cause his mother's all alone right now. She's got MS, I had to leave her at the house all a fucking alone. 
POLICE DETECTIVE I understand, Mr. Detmer.

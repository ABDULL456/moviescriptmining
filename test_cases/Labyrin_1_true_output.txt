84	ESCHER ROTUNDA - NIGHT 
SARAH enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and doorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that obviously have no relation to what we know as gravity. Her knees buckling from vertigo. Then she gasps. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
JARETH is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly. 
JARETH: I've been expecting you. 
SARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. She tries to adjust to being upside down. 
SARAH: Where's Freddie?!!! 
She has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearly grueling. 
JARETH: He's right there. 
And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle from the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but from SARAH's point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the top. 
SARAH (screaming): Freddie! No!!! 
FREDDIE gets to the top but doesn't fall, instead he ends up crawling up the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sends her reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries to orient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABY is about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. He begins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what was gain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like "up" and "down." 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
FREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a staircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETH creates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course, it bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. She turns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the archway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while she's looking, the first reflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right, and so on all the way down the line. And SARAH's still standing there! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor, watching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances on the wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIE on one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls off that, he'll really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and finds that there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way to reach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then at FREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end of the song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH and can't repress a grin of her own. 
SARAH: Like the man said, "nothing is what it appears to be!" 
She jumps. 
85	INT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT 
SARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETH sits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his lap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is a few minutes before 13. JARETH stands up. 
JARETH: There's still time. 
He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her watch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. He looks down at her. 
JARETH: Besides, I'm no longer interested in having a little goblin prince. I've decided I'd much rather have a queen. 
He looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesn't look away. Instead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him. 
SARAH (archly): A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know. 
She glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chuckles appreciatively. 
JARETH: You've come a long way, little girl. 
SARAH looks out at the labyrinth. 
SARAH: I certainly have. 
She turns to face him. 
JARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. (he moves closer to her) No one else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has ever been worthy ... 
He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smiles down at him. 
SARAH: What's your offer. 
JARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a long way! 
JARETH: Why, everything ... you'll rule by my side.

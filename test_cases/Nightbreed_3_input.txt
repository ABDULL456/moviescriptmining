236. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT 
Tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number of wounded Breed against one of the walls. One of the creatures attempts to scramble away. Tommy guns him down. He turns to the other gunmen. 
TOMMY: Watch this! 
The two posse members prepare to kill the Breed. The ground around them begins to shudder, and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs the leg of a posse member and drags him down. 
Another fist then bursts out of the ground. 
Then in silhouette the Berserkers climb out of the earth beside the posse. Two of the posse turn, and fire at the Berserkers, who advance through the hail of the bullets, and quickly dispatch the two gunmen. Tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered Breed, obliging them to dance. 
TOMMY [laughs]: Dance, fuckers! 
The display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three surviving posse members, who - like Tommy - are as yet unaware that the Berserkers are advancing on them. Tommy continues to fire at the ground around the Breed, as one by one his three companions are dispatched by the Berserkers. We close in on Tommy, whose face is suddenly spattered with blood. He stops firing. He looks round to find himself surrounded by Berserkers. The shadows fall over him. Their hands take hold of him. 
We see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls: his body is torn apart. 
We cut to the Berserkers. Ghost has Tommy's gun, with the hand still attached. He tosses it aside, roaring like King Kong. The wounded Breed hurry away as the Berserkers head off in search of new mischief. 
237. EXT. NECROPOLIS NEAR THE GATES NIGHT 
With the tide turning inside the Necropolis, a disorganized retreat is underway. Eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his 'army' staggering away. Joyce is watching the scene. 
EIGERMAN: Stand your ground! Stand your ground! They've got to come this way. We can mow 'em down. 
He climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates. In the driving seat is Gibbs. Beside him, a woman, her face smoke-stained, her expression near catatonic. 
EIGERMAN: Gibbs? 
GIBBS: Sir? 
EIGERMAN: Lights! 
Gibbs switches the lights on, to pierce the smoke. Bad move. The illumination shows the Berserkers appearing. They approach the vehicle. 
EIGERMAN: Shit! 
Eigerman jumps from the vehicle, as the retreating posse fire at the Berserkers. It's a useless response. Bloodied but unbowed, the Berserkers run at the vehicles. The woman throws herself out, but Gibbs isn't quick enough. One of the Berserkers pushes the vehicle up the wall of the Necropolis, and Blatz, a small, vicious creature, stamps on the roof. Inside, Gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in. He is crushed. 
Joyce, who has been watching this entire scene, moves away from the gate towards the Necropolis. The fires are dying down somewhat, and an eerie half-light bathes the scene he moves through. A few surviving posse hurry away, firing at every movement in the shadows. 
Back at the gate we see one of the escaping Berserkers flip another car over, while his brothers dispatch posse members. The survivors simply drop their weapons and flee.

237B. SCENE DELETED 
238. INT. MAUSOLEUM NIGHT 
The dog-faced man lies dead at the door and beside him Babette, her face subtly bestial. Joyce hears Babette weeping; her cries hit him hard. He goes to her, gathers her up gently in his arms. Babette clings to him; he sees her arms are partially transformed into claws, but he keeps holding her. 
Boone emerges from the depths, into the wrecked mausoleum. 
BABETTE: Boone...[he goes to them] Lori. She's hurt. 
BOONE: Where? 
Babette points outside. 
239. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT 
Lori runs, Decker follows, his steps steady, relentless and gaining. Lori takes another stride and the ground gives way beneath her. She slides down into the earth. 
240. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT 
Boone is tracking them, Joyce following, carrying Babette, who has a vision. 
BABETTE: Falling! 
241. EXT. BELOW MIDIAN 
Chaos, and collapse. Earth is falling all around. Lori picks herself up and finds her way back up is blocked by debris. She has no choice but to cross the swaying walkways, while the air thickens with dust and smoke. 
There are only one or two Breed left alive down here, desperately collecting their belongings. They exit the chamber leaving the smoking bowls...We track towards the bowls, as the contents brighten and bubble. 
241A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN 
Lori descends a flight of stairs, to find Peloquin badly wounded at the bottom. 
PELOQUIN: It's all over. I didn't believe the prophesies and now it's all over. 
LORI: What prophesies? 
Peloquin takes her arm. 
PELOQUIN: You want to see? 
241B. INT. ENTRANCE TO MURAL CHAMBER NIGHT 
Peloquin pushes Lori ahead of him. 
PELOQUIN: See? 
We track towards the mural. Lori can barely believe her eyes. Here, laid out on the walls, is a whole history; and featured amongst its more recent additions, the face of Boone. 
PELOQUIN: Yes, it's him. 
Boone squatting in front of his fire of love letters. Boone dead in the reeds. 
PELOQUIN: All these years waiting for a saviour. But he hasn't saved us. He's destroyed us. I made him, and he's destroyed us.

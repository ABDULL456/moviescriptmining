Mr. Smith, sir! 
Still no response. The valet taps the bedclothes-shrouded shoulder gently. 
DAWSON 
Mr. Smith, sir혰 
Sleepily, Stew turns, his eyes heavy with sleep. 
128. MEDIUM SHOT 
DAWSON 
How do you like your bath, sir? 
STEW 
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath? 
Stew peers up, puzzled. 
STEW 
Who are you? 
DAWSON 
(surprised) 
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir. 
STEW 
You're my what? 
DAWSON 
Your valet, sir. 
Stew still stares at him. Then he nods to himself - thinks he gets the idea. Stew kicks back the covers and sits on the edge of the bed in his pajamas. Still sitting on the edge of the bed, he starts to slip his feet into a pair of slippers. The valet bends on one knee to help him. 
STEW 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was? 
DAWSON 
Dawson, sir. 
STEW 
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night? 
DAWSON 
Drunk, sir? 
Stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown, but again the valet beats him to it - holding it for him and helping him slip into it. 
STEW 
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet. 
DAWSON 
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir. 
Stew, surprised, turns on him quickly. 
STEW 
Who did engage you then, if I didn't engage you? What are you doing with my pants혰 
The valet picks up his pants. 
STEW 
Did you take anything out of those pants? 
DAWSON 
Oh no, sir! 
STEW 
What are you doing fooling around in here? 
DAWSON 
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir. 
Stew pulls out a cigarette. The valet, without missing a beat, leans over and offers a light. A wary Stew accepts. 
STEW 
Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith - to engage me a valley. 
129. WIDER SHOT 
Stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a small table, waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal. The valet is right behind him, holding up his bathrobe for Stew to step into. 
STEW 
(putting on the bathrobe) 
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife. 
DAWSON 
Thank you, sir. 
STEW 
But not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today. 
The valet pays no attention to him, but walks around the room, picking up the clothes that Stew has flung about. 
DAWSON 
Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman, as it were. Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you - it's really most essential, sir. 
Stew, with his cigarette between his lips, stands watching the valet as he retrieves the various articles of cast-off clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat patronizing. He walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers, preparatory to laying out fresh things for Stew. Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes him by the shoulder, and yanks him around to face him. 
130. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND DAWSON 
The valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the belligerent expression on Stew's face. 
STEW 
(over-sweetly) 
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up? 
DAWSON 
Quite so. Quite. 
STEW 
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact. 
DAWSON 
Now Mr. Smith, now please혰 
Stew is rapidly losing his temper. 
STEW 
You've got a nice face, Dawson, you wouldn't want anything to happen to your face, would you? 
The valet puts a bewildered hand to his face. 
DAWSON 
Oh no, sir혰

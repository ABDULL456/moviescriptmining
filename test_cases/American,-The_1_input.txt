LARRY (V.O.) I told `em if we couldn't trust you to keep a tight lid on operations the who could we trust? 
JACK They can. They can trust me and so can you. 
JACK is tense. Every word is carefully enunciated: 
JACK I've never jeopardised an operation in my life. 
LARRY (V.O.) You don't have to tell me that, Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed your own girlfriend's account... 
ECU on JACK. 
127   INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY                            127 
The words are out before he can stop them. 
LARRY Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry. 
He rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity. 
LARRY That was, um.... I'm just saying you can be relied on. 
Silence. 
LARRY Jack? 
CLICK. 
128   EXT. PAY PHONE- DAY                                          128 
JACK has hung up. 
He is lost in fearful thought, jaw muscles grinding. 
129   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- NIGHT                                     129 
Amongst the GARGOYLES... 
...JACK, looking through his miniature binoculars. 
His POV: 
Of CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick, tough YOUNG ITALIAN MAN in a suit. 
He is showing her photographs. Of what- we cannot see. CLARA looks very, very serious. 
The YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves. JACK watches him get into a smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN. Rome plates. 
When he looks back at the cafe, CLARA has gone.

CLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to the Parco della Resistanza, sheltering in the shade of a tree. 
She is holding the RED PURSE. At her feet is blue plastic bag rounded out by a watermelon. 
JACK pulls his CAR into the curb. 
CLARA Ciao, Eduardo! 
She opens the passenger door, leans in and kisses JACK long and full on the lips. 
JACK Put them in the back. We've got a way to go. 
She puts the plastic bag in the trunk. 
Inside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER. 
132   INT. CAR-   DAY                                             132 
CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt. 
She puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the RED PURSE. 
And drives. 
CLARA Where we go? 
JACK Swimming. 
CLARA How far do we go? To Fanale? 
JACK An hour. And we're not going to the sea, we're going to the lakes. In the mountains. 
CLARA For a... come se dice... you have in the back... 
JACK A picnic. 
CLARA A pick-nick! We are going for a pick-nick. Just the two of us. 
She looks at him. 
CLARA I have practise my English, Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick. It is a beautiful day, isn't it? 
JACK It is.

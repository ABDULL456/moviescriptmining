As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a tablespoon of castor oil. 
BUDDY (wanly) Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil? 
MOTHER This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this. 
BUDDY (he is resigned, there's no way out; he makes a face, swallows the castor oil) Geccch, yehh, guhhhh! 
MOTHER Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it. 
BUDDY Uhhh, gahdam stuff! 
MOTHER What did you say, Brother? 
BUDDY I said ahhh-dam stuff. 
MOTHER No, you didn't say that, Brother. 
BUDDY Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff. 
DOLL No, Mother, he's lying... 
BUDDY Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts 
WASKI (happily excited, stammering) He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook! 
BUDDY Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you! 
MOTHER Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! (the children at once simmer down) The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow? 
BUDDY She's getting herself up to go out. 
MOTHER (frowns, adjusts hearing aid) What'd you say, Brother? 
BUDDY She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now. 
MOTHER Oh, yes, it's Thursday. (glances around at sound of an opening door) Hello, Rose, dear... (her eyes open wide as she stares at Rose, disconcerted; now weakly) ... my, you're... looking pretty... 
CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all. 
The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is on her face. 
ROSE How do you like my outfit? I made most of it myself. 
Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP Mother. 
MOTHER (smiling, slightly aghast) Well, it's... very gay. 
We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway. 
BUDDY Here comes Daddy. 
ROSE (staring down admiringly at the outfit) I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook. 
MOTHER (makes up her mind to defend Rose) Well, I think it's charming, Rose. (tactfully) But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight? 
ROSE Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging. 
We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening. 
CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual, he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees. 
DADDY Ye gods and little fishes. What have you done to yourself, Rose? 
ON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of attention. 
ROSE Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all. 
DADDY Got yourself up? 
ROSE Yeah. I'm goin' out. 
Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at table. 
DADDY Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose. 
MOTHER Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful. 
ROSE (smiles affectionately at Mother) You're so sweet. 
DADDY If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup. 
ROSE Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.

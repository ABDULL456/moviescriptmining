CHANCE So am I, Eve. 
Allenby comes out the door, his mood is serious, professional. Eve turns quickly, awaits his news. 
ALLENBY (sits alongside Eve) ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben... 
EVE (anxious) ... But he's...? 
ALLENBY He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet... 
Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the house. 
MRS. AUBREY Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post. 
CHANCE (not moving) Thank you. 
MRS. AUBREY Would you care to take it, sir? 
CHANCE Yes. 
Chance still does not move. Eve mistakes Chance's not moving for concern for herself. She puts a hand on his shoulder. 
EVE I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey... 
CHANCE (rising) Yes, Eve. You'll be all right. 
Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey into the house. Eve watches him go, then turns to Allenby. 
EVE ... He's such a sensitive man, so considerate... 
INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mrs. Aubrey leads Chance to a phone at one of the desks. The three television sets are on, attract Chance's attention. 
CHANCE (picks up phone, looks at TVs) Hello. 
INT. WASHINGTON POST - COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
SID COURTNEY, a Black man in his fifties, wears a rumpled wool jacket, smokes a pipe. 
COURTNEY Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post. 
INTERCUT - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE / COURTNEY'S OFFICE 
CHANCE Hello, Sid. 
COURTNEY I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy. 
CHANCE (looking from one TV to the other) No. I'm not busy. 
COURTNEY Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself. 
CHANCE The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much. 
COURTNEY Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation? 
CHANCE I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. 
COURTNEY Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you. 
CHANCE Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that. 
Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning. 
COURTNEY I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business? 
CHANCE I have nothing more to say. 
Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs. 
Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver down. 
COURTNEY (to himself) Typical - no wonder he's so close to Rand... 
INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY 
Chance comes out of Mrs. Aubrey's office, notices the service elevator.

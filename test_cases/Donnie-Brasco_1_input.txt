MAGGIE ...He comes home at all hours of the night, without announcing when or why, or where he's been for three weeks. Or three months. Then he expects everything to be just the way he wants it.

46   CONTINUED:    (2) DONNIE I ain't runnin' from nothin'. MAGGIE (mimics) 'I ain't runnin' from nuttin'. The man I married was a college man. (to Berger) Sorry. BERGER (resuming, to Donnie) Being the distancer forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer. That gives you a feeling of power. Simultaneously you resent Maggie for expressing the very intimacy needs that in your own li fe yo u 'v e-- DONNIE . I ' m an undercover agent for the FBI! MAGGIE I didn't marry the FBI, Joe. He writes on a pad. Donnie tries to peek at what he's writing. BERGER Okay. I want yo u to spli t the week in half. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are Joe's intimacy days. Tuesdays, Thursday s, and Saturdays are Maggie' s. On your day, you make one intimacy request. Your partner agrees in advance to meet it. Whatever it is. DONNIE What's that---an intimacy request? BERGER A n i nti mac y r eque st. Li ke 'Ru b my back,' or 'Help me work out this problem with the kids.' Odd day, even day, Sunday's off. (beat) And mastur bate. I r ecommend i t, for both of you. It's a good way to blow off stress. CUT TO:

47   CONTINUED: DONNIE Can I ask you something? MAGGIE NO. DONNIE How much is this costing? Maggie doesn't say anything. DONNIE Okay, Maggie--I want you to answer my question. This is my intimacy request. MAGGIE A hundred dollars. DONNIE That was a hundred dollars? MAGGIE That's what I said, Joe. DONNIE A hundred dollars. And how many of these do you think we'll need? .              . MAGGIE I don't know. DONNIE One hundred dollars. MAGGIE Is this still your intimacy request?

DONNIE (mincing) 'Will you rub my back'? Va'a'fonaooll MAGGIE You're an animal. (CONTINUED) 
47   CONTINUED: D O N NI E You know wha   t my intimacy request is fo r him?   It' s very in timate. He can take    that bill he's gonna send me and    shove it up his ass. Maggie starts to PUNCH him. MAGGIE You're an animal1 Animal1 Donnie tries to fend her off while he drives. The car swings wildly. Approaching the opposite way: A TRACTOR TRAILER Donnie SWERVES. The car tumbles off the road onto a soft shoulder. Maggie continues to hit at Donnie. He wrestles with her. MAGGIE I hope (punch) those guys you're hanging out with (punch) are laying you (punch) because I ' m (punch) not anymore! He looks at her. She looks at him.

We h ave t hree child ren, Joe--r emember t hem? One of us has to play it safe. She SLAMS out of the car... OUT ON THE SHOULDER with cars whipping by...Donnie chases after her. DONNIE I just asked a simple question. You're the one that brought it up with the affair. MAGGIE Bulls hit. It's so fr iggi ng ironic that you'd think I ' m up to s omet hing. My n ights are homework and basketball games. What are your nights? DONNIE You know what I'm doing. MAGGIE I don't know a goddam thing. DONNIE I'm doing the job. That's the job. MAGGIE I live like a widow, Joe. That's the only way I can deal with this, with the photographs and memories and our children, and I go on with my life. Like you're already dead.

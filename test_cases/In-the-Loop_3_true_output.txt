MALCOLM Now. And don't say you weren't prepared because I rang ahead. (To JUDY) Give us a minute, will you love? 
Judy gets up as Malcolm turns back to SIMON 
MALCOLM (CONT'D) In the words of the late, great Nat King Fucking Cole, `Unforeseeable, that's what you are..' 
11   INT. DFI OPEN PLAN OFFICE                                        11 
JUDY has spotted TOBY. 
JUDY So you're...whatever your name is, Dan, the new advisor? Daniel. 
TOBY Toby. 
JUDY Right. Just most of you lot tend to be called Dan, or Danny, so it's always worth a punt. OK, hello. As you know, I'm Judy Molloy, Civil Service Director of Communications for International Development. 
They shake hands.

TOBY Is this a normal morning, or...? 
Judy's not got time for questions. 
JUDY Okay, I've got a meeting in (looks at watch) two minutes. And the minister was rubbish in last night's interview. 
TOBY Rubbish? 
JUDY It's a technical term. It means he went on the radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish. 
Someone goes into Simon's office. As door opens we hear heated conversation between Simon and Malcolm. 
MALCOLM [IN OFFICE] You sounded like a panicky chimp trapped in a washing machine. 
12   INT. DFID SIMON'S OFFICE. DAY.                                 12 
Back inside Simon's office. 
SIMON Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion. MALCOLM Oh why didn't you say? I mean, he asked you. Fuck. Of course, that explains it. Yeah. Say, if he'd asked you to fucking black up, or give him your PIN number, or shot yourself, would you have done that as well. 
SIMON I would have blacked up. It was the radio and no-one would have known. 
MALCOLM Yeah. Very good. 
SIMON But war is -- basically unforeseeable isn't it? 
MALCOLM That is not our line, alright? Walk the fucking line. Look. (MOR E) Page 10

We've got the US National Security Advisor's main guy coming. Yeah? We've got enough Pentagon goons here for a fucking coup d'etat. This is not the time to send out a signal like this in some personal fucking sodcast. 
JUDY and TOBY come in. 
JUDY Minister, this is Toby. 
MALCOLM Not the time love. Fuck off. 
JUDY smiles at MALCOLM, and doesn't fuck off. 
SIMON Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the madhouse!'I apologise for Malcolm. 
MALCOLM Don't apologise for me. You should apologise for yourself. (to Judy) Did I not just tell you to fuck off and yet you're still here? 
JUDY That's correct. 
MALCOLM (to Toby) Hey, foetus boy. Lesson One: If I tell you to fuck off what do you do? 
TOBY Fuck off? 
MALCOLM You'll go far.Now fuck off. 
TOBY Right. 
Toby fucks off. We can see him outside, wandering around, not knowing what to do with himself. 
SIMON We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that I could row back on Question Time tonight. 
MALCOLM No, You're not going on Question Time tonight. You've been disinvited. Page 11 
12   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          12 
SIMON Why? We've been prepping Question Time. 
MALCOLM Because they ask fucking questions on Question Time. And you're no good at questions. If it was Fumbling, Off- Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you'd be our main guy. But it's not. 
JUDY Sorry, why wasn't I told about this? 
MALCOLM Why should I tell you about this?

Rayon sways; Eve grabs his arm.   Ron watches as Eve helps Rayon inside. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 35 
RON You women love Nancy Boys. 
Ron crosses to help Rayon to the couch.   He leans his head back, labors to breathe. 
EVE (to Rayon) Tell me what's wrong. 
RON Hell, I'll tell you what's wrong, it's the goddamn AZT! 
EVE What? 
RON It's killin' him, can't you see that? Why you think I look so healthy? 
Ron reaches into his his jacket, produces a small BOX filled with MEDS. He takes out a brand new syringe and bottle of liquid. 
RON Tinkerbell, how much cash you got? 
Off his silence, Ron rummages through Rayon's purse, extracts two twenties, pockets them, and starts preparing the syringe. 
EVE What the hell do you think you're doing?! 
RON Helpin' him, that's what. 
EVE He's a participant in a clinical trial, we need to get him to the hospital! 
RON So they can fuck him up even worse? 
Ron disregards her protests, starts to inject Rayon. 
EVE Are you out of your mind?!    If anything happens to him-- 
RON Relax, it's just a little vitamin boost, A, C, zinc. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 36 
RON (CONT'D) (to Rayon) You want to live, get off the AZT. 
EVE It's a blind study! We don't even know if he's getting AZT! 
RAYON Everyone knows what they're gettin'. AZT tastes differently. I guess I got lucky and got the real thing. 
RON Yeah, real lucky. (to Eve) I've got stuff here that works. Healthy, non-toxic. You should trial it and we'll both get rich. 
EVE Leave, please! 
Ron turns to Rayon. 
RON Tell your friends about me. Send `em my way and I'll hook `em up. 
Ron heads for the door. 
RON And tell `em to bring their fuckin' money. Cash. No checks. 
Eve and Rayon can't believe this guy.

Dozens of GAY MEN mill about; Ron watches as some hold hands, others grope one another. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 37 
He spots a COUPLE just talking,   but as he approaches, they start making out. Ron stops in his tracks, turns to leave, bumps right into a MAN dressed just like him, except this cowboy's CHAPS have nothing covering his ass. The guy nods for Ron to follow him inside the club. 
RON Are you out of your fucking mind?!

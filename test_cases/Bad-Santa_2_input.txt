He puts the folio back, grabs the cash. 
KID You need money to fix your sleigh? 
WILLIE Huh? Yeah, whateverthefuck... 
KID You want milk and cookies? 
Willie bends down and faces the Kid with a smile. 
WILLIE Daddy got a car? 
EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily. 
KID Bye Santa! 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down. The inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow -- about six or seven seconds. 
ANGLE ON: 
A wiry, hard-bitten, sun-baked saddlebag of a man, GIN SLAGEL sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless Pall Mall. We can hear his in-taken breath rattling over and around the phlegm, growths, and polyps that line his embattled trachea. His words come out on an exhaled cloud chamber's worth of smoke: 
GIN "Fuck stick"? 
Bob Chipeska sits opposite. 
CHIPESKA Yes, I thought it was strange too, but you know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his little friend promised he wouldn't say it in front of the children. Which is fine because, you know, urn, there's an adult world and a child's world and that's okay. I'm not a censor. 
GIN Little friend? 
CHIPESKA Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget... a, a, I don't know what he's called exactly but... a little guy. Little. Billy Barty. God rest. But thin fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers. 
GIN "Little people," that's what they like. 
CHIPESKA Ah, yes, right. 
GIN So "fuck stick," that's all? 
CHIPESKA Well, no, there was something else... 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WOMEN'S BIG AND TALL - (EARLIER) 
Chipeska walks by a cashier station carrying some paperwork he's absorbed in, but hears some FAINT GROANS that make him pause. Curious, he heads in the direction of the sounds. 
They're coming from the dressing room area. 
Chipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of dressing rooms. 
CHIPESKA (V.O.) ...A couple of days ago I was in Women's Big & Tall? -- 
A sign reads: "Three Times A Lady". 
INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - DRESSING ROOM AREA - (EARLIER) 
He goes down a corridor of dressing rooms. 
CHIPESKA (V.O.) and I heard these, urn, you know, these... noises. 
The sound of throttling lust builds in volume. He follows his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door. A Big or Tall woman within screams with pleasure: 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Oh yeah! Oh yeah! 
WILLIE'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah! Yeah! You ain't gonna shit right for a week! 
He looks underneath and spots black Santa boots with red velvet pants around the ankles.

I/E. TAXI/BERLIN - SAME Martin getting in, agitated. 
MARTIN Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick. The driver pulls out into traffic. The rain still heavy. Martin stares out at the wet city. Eyes track as the shadowy columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by. He lets himself relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm. He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young, female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than her years. Layers of clothing. GINA. She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her. 
GINA Everyone says how much it's changed. Berlin. Eyes connect, brief. Wipers flip-flap. 
MARTIN .I wouldn't know. First time. 
GINA Yes, me too. I mean, I wouldn't know either. You're American? He looks back at her, inquisitive... 
GINA (CONT'D) For the airport, it's always Americans in the morning... Asians at night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Martin nods, pulls out his phone. Service dies as Gina downshifts, Doc Martins working the pedals, accelerates away from the large "Flughafen" (Airport) sign, down a cobbled road next to main route. 
MARTIN I think you missed... He stops, smiles as he realizes she's navigated around a large construction back-up, saving them time. 
GINA You do what you do, I do what I do, right? 
MARTIN What do you do, when you're not...? She laughs. He smiles, nods. Okay, dumb thing to say. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) Sorry, I didn't mean anything -- 
GINA It's okay. I know what you meant. Her eyes meet his in the mirror. She swings the taxi onto Wilhelmstrasse. Stops at a red light. Ahead, the Marshall Bridge over the River Spree. 
LIGHT TURNS GREEN Gina moves the taxi mid-stream in the traffic heading onto the bridge. Martin checks his phone, he's got service. He starts to dial... Suddenly -- the cars in front of her start VEERING WILDLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, just missing the boxed REFRIGERATOR tumbling off the truck in front of them. The box BURSTS open. Gina swerves to avoid it, CLIPS the corner... front tire BLOWS OUT... taxi skids crazily, HITS the CURB. Tires SHREDDING... shower of SPARKS. Taxi SLAMS over the curb, THROUGH the rail. Plunges off the bridge. 
MARTIN'S FACE Strangely serene. Intense vivid IMAGES... the playing card 'ACE TAXIS' logo on the dash... GINA'S EYES in the MIRROR... Silent free-fall dive. Timeless. Dreamlike.

WHAM--! TAXI HITS THE WATER Martin's head SMACKS against the side window. Gina cushioned by the airbags, which she wrestles back. WATER SPRAYS IN. Gina can't open her door. Steel steering-lock on the floor. Grabs it, SMASHES the side window. Hauls herself out... 
INTO THE RIVER . gasping. On the bridge above, people frantically flag down traffic... Gina turns, sees the Taxi, midstream, sinking. Martin still in back, unconscious. No time. Gina gulps air, dives. She reaches into the front of the cab, grabs the steering lock, HAMMERS it against the passenger window, glances up: THE SURFACE, starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath, sinking... Gina hammers at the glass again, it BREAKS. Grabs Martin's limp body, drags him up to the surface. A CROWD ON the bank. People wading out to help. Taking Martin from her, carrying him up onto dry land. LIGHTS, SIRENS... The POLICE arriving, pushing back the crowd. PARAMEDICS quickly laying Martin out on the concrete. Everyone's focus on the unconscious man. Gina eases back... melts away into the growing horde of on-lookers as the paramedics rip open Martin's shirt... feeding a tube down his throat. Pushing on his stomach. DEFIBRILLATOR paddles. WHINE as defibrillators charge. A PARAMEDIC lifts Martin's eyelid, shines a flashlight... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FAINT HALO OF LIGHT in a dark fog. Distant voices -- 
SUDDEN SHIFT --.INTENSE FLASH OF MEMORY... UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL. Youthful MARTIN speaking on the spotlit podium. Intense, energized. A college age LIZ in the audience. LAUGHTER of rapt students. Loud APPLAUSE. A jovial older COLLEAGUE eagerly shaking Martin's hand... 
SMASH BACK TO THE RIVER BANK... Paddles on Martin's chest. Paramedic calls out: 
PARAMEDIC Achtung! WHOMPF! The charge surges into Martin's body. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT... a CONSERVATORY. Martin as a CHILD. Fascinated, delighted as his FATHER shows him the opening bud of a blossom. Butterflies' wings SHIMMER in sunlight... 
WHOMPF! SECOND ARCING CHARGE... Martin's chest heaves up. Slumps back down... 
SMASH CUT INTO MEMORY -- TWO BODIES MOVING... . Liz and Martin making love. Passionate, intertwined. 
WHOMPF! ANOTHER SURGE OF ELECTRICITY... Martin's chest rising up... 
SMASH CUT AGAIN -- LIZ... . half-dressed, hair ruffled and wet. Towelling it. Turning toward us. Smiles. Her lips moving... 
WHOMPF! A FOURTH PULSE... Martin's body slumping back. Sudden QUIET now, the world removed. Just his face. His eyes. 
MARTIN (V.O.) They say your whole life flashes before you... but it's the little things... the details... the moments. Its like looking at a painting. Stand close, all you can see are the brush strokes. It's only when you step back that you get the whole picture... 
SLOWLY BECOMING...

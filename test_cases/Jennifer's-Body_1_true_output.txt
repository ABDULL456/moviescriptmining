TONI That's what you think. One of these days you're gonna be crying out for me and I might not be there. 
NEEDY Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning? 
TONI No. I just did my scratch tickets, snorted a few Lunesta and went straight to bed. Is something going on? NEEDY Nothing. Forget it. TONI Don't nothing happen in Devil's Kettle. 
She watches the FERRET skitter across the kitchen floor. TONI (CONT'D) Anita, that ferret stinks. He needs to be washed from craw to cornhole. NEEDY Yes ma'am. Toni shakes her head and heads upstairs. 
EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight. The sun has begun to set. An ambulance and four police cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS'S PARENTS are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating the ground with her fists. A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance. OFFICER WARZAK exits one of the police cruisers. Her signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect. She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother. OFFICER WARZAK We will get the man that did this to your son. You hear me? We'll get that sick M.F. JONAS'S DAD I'll get him myself! I will! You hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door! Like one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got! That'll be your balls! 
EXT. ACROSS THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the lake. The water is eerily calm. 
Suddenly, a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake. It's Jennifer, gliding through the water. She looks calm and serene. The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens, shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful scene. Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the pier, naked and dripping wet. She runs her tongue over her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out from between her two front teeth, like she's just finished a delicious rib dinner. Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier.

Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened. 
INT. NEEDY'S ROOM - EVENING Needy is sitting at her lamp-lit desk, reading an old E.C. horror comic and eating a banana. The phone rings. Needy picks it up. NEEDY Needy speaking. CROSS CUT PHONE CALL: 
INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's changed into shorts and a tank top. Music blasts from her stereo. She admires herself in the mirror, popping her ass. 
JENNIFER I feel sooo scrumptious! She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from the wound. NEEDY Good for you. JENNIFER You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate. NEEDY Yeah. JENNIFER It's that good. Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEEDY Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town? JENNIFER Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast. She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the FLAME to her tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently. 
NEEDY That's really nice. JENNIFER I tell it like it is. Besides, you should be happy for me. I'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar. NEEDY Jesus didn't invent the calendar. 
Jennifer giggles maniacally and sighs with happiness.

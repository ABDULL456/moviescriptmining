{"test1_input": "GORDO So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says \"The code's fine, the program's for shit\" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk! They all break out into LAUGHTER. JAKE So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, \"You're fired! Your whole team's fired!\" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo-- MILES But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine! More LAUGHS. GORDO I haven't been able to use a public bathroom since. LUPUS Especially with the thing! Lupus's non-sequitur brings the whole rhythm of the conversation to a grinding halt. JAKE Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses. ASHSY I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that. GORDO Masters of our own destiny. LILY So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with? ASHBY City Bank of Manhattan. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: GORDO That's that Gillette guy, right? (off Ashby's nod) You Like him? As a boss, I mean. ASHBY He's . . . He's okay. GORDO (goading) Come on... ASHBY No. More LAUGHS. JAKE What do you do over at your bank, Grant? ASHBY What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance. The group exchanges Looks. MILES Wow. We haven't met with anyone your level yet. VP? So that means there's you, then the P. ASHBY (Confidently Yeah.   That's right. FREEZE FRAME ON ASHBY... JAKE (V.O.) Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing. RESUME ACTION JAKE Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan. ASHBY Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JAKE A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part. ASHBY That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off. JAKE They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course. ASHBY Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back. JAKE We know exactly how we're going to make The money back. There in lies the Catch-22 ASHBY I don't follow. An uncomfortable silence falls. GORDO Jake... LILY It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys. She throws Ashby a flirty smile. LUPUS Yeah.   He's our boy. Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm. It's meant to be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's head to the side. Ashby lets out an uncomfortable LAUGH as he rubs his arm. JAKE (leaning in) Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? (off Ashby's nod) Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com? ASHBY Big.Com.   That Internet thing. \n", "test1_true": "CONTINUED: JAKE Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan. ASHY Sort of like a letter of intent. JAKE Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore. ASHBY And you have this letter of intent? JAKE (quietly) Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little. LILY We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now.   If they beat us to it... JAKE Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help. Ashby considers for a moment. ASHBY Should we get another round? Jake and Lily share an almost imperceptible look. CUT TO: \nTNT.- CITY STREET- NIGHT Jake, Lupus, Miles, Gordo and Lily walking, still on a celebratory high. GORDO Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy. MILES I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in? LILY I' m going home GORDO Let's go, Jake? JAKE Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off. GORDO You sure? Jake looks over at. Lily then nods.      Gordo, Miles and Lupus start to head off. JAKE Lupus! Lupus turns and Jake moves closer. JAKE (cont'd) When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al. LUPUS You going to have the time? JAKE I'11 find the time. Lupus nods and heads off.     Jake watches them go. LILY Look at you... You want to go. JAKE For what?   A couple hundred bucks? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LILY I think you'd do it for free. You' re almost drooling. You like the rush. JAKE It's what I do. It's my job. LILY Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something? JAKE Are you asking me if I have something to prove? LILY Do you have something to prove? JAKE Not in that repressed anger sort of way. LILY I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option. JAKE Good quality porn has it's place in the world. LILY Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this? JAKE I'm good at it. Lying, cheating. Manipulating... I'm good at it. LILY It's more than that. JAKE Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would. LILY So that was my part?   Smile and shake my ass? JAKE No. You have another part?

Jake turns just in time to catch Rottovich's fist square in the face. Jake staggers back and Sobozinski pushes him into an alley. JAKE That tip not work-out for you fellas? ROTTOVICH Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed. JAKE Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business. Sobozinski punches Jake in the stomach.    Miles and Gordo lurch forward-- SOBOZINSKI (pulling his gun) Back up. LUPUS You want I should hold him down? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Gordo throws Lupus a look. ROTTOVICH Special Agent Gunther Moonan.     Ring a bell? JAKE Gunther?    I think I'd remember a Gunther. ROTTOVICH Ring it for him, Sobo. Sobozinski punches Jake again. JAKE Oh yeah.    Moonan.   I remember now. Thanks. ROTTOVICH Well he's   in town and he sure as shit remembers   you. What are we going to do about this   Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed   onto us. JAKE Wouldn't dream of it. Rottovich punches Jake hard in the stomach, sending him GASPING to the ground. ROTTOVICH I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develope a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake. JAKE (gasping for breath) Something stupid. ROTTOVICH Good boy. SOBOZINSKI And don't leave town! (to Rottovich) I always wanted to say that... As the cops exit, Lily, Miles and Gordo rush to Jake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: LILY People don't like you much, do they? Jake lets out a pained GROAN as they help him up. CUT TO: INT.- CAR- DAY Rottovich and Sobozinski get in the front of a squad car. In the back, Moonan sits reading the Travel section of the NY Times. MOONAN Did he buy it? ROTTOVICH I think so.    What'd he ever do to you anyway? MOONAN Let's just say he burned me once. Moonan calmly turns the page of the paper. LUPUS (V.O.) Why's this guy so hard up for you? You're not exactly a threat to national security. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY Jake sits at a barstool, battered and bruised. Lily tends to him with a towel. Miles and Gordo pour drinks. Lupus sits at a table, watching. JAKE We go way back... CUT TO: EXT.- DOG RACETRACK- DAY A BELL... A mechanical rabbit springs forward.         Greyhounds bolt out of the gate. JAKE (V.O.) About four years ago, we were working in Miami, turf fixing for some local goon.

But now he had me on attempted bribery of a Federal Agent. As Moonan stands, we see Big Al get up from the next table. A1 \"bumps\" into Gordo, dressed in a waiter's white jacket. Gordo \"trips;\" spilling scalding hot coffee into Moonan's lap. Jake casually gets up and leaves. FREEZE FRAME ON MOONAN'S CONTORTED FACE. JAKE (V.O.)

LILY So what?   We just stay clear of him. Jake gets up, hard enough to knock the chair over. LILY Jesus... Take it easy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JAKE No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time. MILES What do we do? We change the scam? JAKE There is no scam!    I've got a fucking sign on my back!    I can't leave town now and come back   with a suitcase full of money. You get    it? It's over. We walk. GORDO Jake-- JAKE What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up. LILY That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this! GORDO Jake, I mean, come on-- JAKE No, no, no! Not  this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop.

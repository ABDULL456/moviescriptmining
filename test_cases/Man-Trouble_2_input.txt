BACK TO SCENE Harry takes her by the arm and looks amiably toward the Nurse. 
HARRY Which way? 
NURSE ONE                           * (gesturing a direction) That way, Doctor, and thank you very much for your patience. 
HARRY Don't mention it. The Nurse watches briefly as they move away, then extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the door and locks it. 
87   EXT. M.P. CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                         87 Harry, outside the Mercedes, glancing around furtively, while inside the car, Andy continues to perseverate about Red Layls as she struggles out of Joan's clothes: ANDY And this man, who wouldn't know the truth if it came up and spit him in the eye, is accusing me of lying... She hands him the skirt out through the window: 
ANDY You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me? 
Harry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins getting out of the doctor's jacket. ANDY That I   was a pretty, grudge- bearing   little malcontent, grasping at some   splinter of celebrity for myself   at his expense. Can you believe   that? She hands him out the blouse and he turns politely away from her semi-nudity as he hands her the doctor's jacket. 
HARRY Here, put this on. ANDY I mean, the arrogance... (getting into the jacket) What did she say your name was? 
HARRY Harry. 
ANDY (flirtatiously) Have you got a cigarette, Harry? 
He takes a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from his shirt pocket and hands them to her: HARRY Stay in the car. Don't talk to anybody, and I'll be right back. 
He immediately moves off, rolling Joan's clothes into a bundle and heading back to the hospital grounds. 
MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                             92. 
88   EXT. M.P. CENTER/ GROUNDS - NIGHT                            88 Harry, hurrying across the grounds to the rear of  the hospital. (In the distant b.g. beyond him, the Continental can be seen pulling up and parking on  a street bordering the hospital. Moncrief, carrying   a briefcase, and his chauffeur (Sturge), get out and   move onto a walkway leading to the hospital entrance) 
89   EXT. M.P. CENTER - REAR - NIGHT                              89 Harry rounds the corner of the hospital building and stops: Two male hospital employees are smoking and conversing outside the door he had previously entered with Joan. 
HARRY Fuck! He turns and moves OUT OF SIGHT. 
90   INT. M.P. CENTER/ANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT                         90 
Joan, in a state of extreme nervousness, paces about the room. Her perambulations bring her near the door to the hallway. She reaches to the doorknob, tests it and finds she is locked in. 
JOAN Christ. A soft WHISTLE comes from the vicinity of the windows behind her, followed by Harry's voice, whispering: HARRY (O.S.) Joan?   Are you there? 
She crosses quickly to the windows, looking out through the thick wire mesh at Harry: 
HER POV He stands several feet below, looking up at the window. 
HARRY Is that you? 
BACK TO SCENE 
JOAN Yes, it's me.    Hurry up, will you! 
(CONTINUED) 
90   CONTINUED:                                                     90 HARRY I'm having a little trouble getting back in. JOAN Oh great, Harry. What have you got me into? 
JOAN Don't worry, honey... 
JOAN You have to get me out of here! HARRY Everything's under control, just hang on a few more minutes and I'll be right back, okay? As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it.

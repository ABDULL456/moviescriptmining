ALFRED Ta ta, Hudson Hawk. 
HAWK (breathless) Too-do-loo, babe. 
INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN 
Hawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading the paper. 
ALEX Did I miss anything? 
HAWK Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way. 
ALEX Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to? 
Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle with the cappuccino machine. 
HAWK The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo.. 
ALEX (professorial) Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things. 
The cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes a couple extra seconds to back off. 
HAWK Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS. 
ALEX (holding up newspaper) Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight. 
HAWK "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I.... 
Hawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the "Sforza."  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs. 
HAWK Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand... 
ALEX Why try? 
HAWK (hurdling the bar) Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up. 
ALEX (pulling back newspaper) You re not thinking of going to... 
HAWK Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux? 
INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT 
Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER ...fan-taas-tic example of Florentine marble... Who will start at 160,000...160,000......180,000. 
Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage. Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. 
HAWK All these years of attending auctions, I still get goosebumps.  The paintings, the sculptures....the things that aren't really paintings or sculptures... 
THE WOMAN .... the pretentious vultures who don't even look up from their calculators to see what they're buying.  Now that gives me goosebumps.  Auctions are disgusting. 
HAWK I couldn't agree more.  Savages. 
The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce attributed to the Cellini school.. 
AUCTION ENTRANCE 
Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area wearing a blue ribbon. 
AUCTION AREA 
Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE, A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER, and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara. 
THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his arm. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Sold!  To the caller from Newfoundland. 
A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs and shakes his head. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER And finally, Lot number 17, thought to be lost in the war, and again last night, the Da Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

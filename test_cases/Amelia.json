{"train": "AMELIA \nWritten by \nRonald Bass & Anna Hamilton Phelan \nSeptember 14, 2007 \nEXT. BAR, LAE, NEW GUINEA - DAY \nCLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN. A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the- art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting. PULL BACK to see... \n...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open- sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And peering down through the mist and rain... \n...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane. Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her. Something fierce lives there. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   LAE, NEW GUINEA - 1937. \nFRED (O.S.) Sure I can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous? She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt- streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a Coke which he sets down for her. \nAMELIA Adventurous? You've got the wrong girl, Mister. You should know that by now. Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself four fingers. \nFRED Actually. I knew that the moment I met ol' George. He sips his drink.    She says nothing. \nFRED (CONT'D) I like how you don't talk about him. \nAMELIA That why I get so many chances to not do it? \nFRED Well.   Natural curiosity. His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila. She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her side of the table. \nFRED I mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show. Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail? \nNo response.   Just her clear direct gaze. \nFRED (CONT'D) I'll bet he knew that. First time he met you. \nShe looks out to sea. \nAMELIA He thought I hated him.      He never knew I was fascinated. \nINT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY \nAlone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now, there are none to be seen. Even as... ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad. Does he know she's there? \nSUPERIMPOSE:   NEW YORK, LATER 1937. \nGEORGE (without turning) The first time I met her she sat in that chair. The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And still with his back to her... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You may as well write it down, Mary. Write it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring. He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) We'll see if I remember how to edit. She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'd kept her waiting two hours. \nT She hated me on sight, but she hought I couldn't tell. His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was... His smile is kind.   And honestly self-mocking. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator. But then I guess you know all that, don't you? She looks up reproachfully.   Nothing of the kind, and you know it. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for compliments. He's made her laugh. \nDISSOLVE TO... \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nShe is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an exam. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS PUBLISHING CO. 1928. \nGEORGE (V.O.) The waiting made her furious. She undoubtedly felt I was \nE stablishing my dominance and importance. She doesn't look furious at all. Thumbing through WE by COL. CHARLES LINDBERGH. Photos of Lindy beside the Spirit of St. Louis in Paris. \nGEORGE Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator. She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) And Bill Stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working. She takes Bill's powerful hand. The look between them calm, yet somehow intense. As if each is establishing a tone for their relationship. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got his plane... \nAMELIA \nY ou mean the Admiral flies on those? The pontoons.   She does not seem admiring. \nGEORGE Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself. Bill nods on that.   Sure were. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) This way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue. \nAMELIA Hmmn.   What does that do to our fuel? \nBILL Costs us at least 400 gallons. Don't bother bringing clothes for Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in Ireland. Real lucky. \nGEORGE The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles. But Amelia looks to Bill.   That's not really possible is it? \nBILL The Admiral is the Admiral. He gets to estimate any damn thing he wants. All we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol. She turns to George with challenging eyes. \nBILL (CONT'D) Don't go blaming the bookseller. He's been all through this with Mrs. Guest, but she worships the Admiral. And it's money that puts planes in the air. \nAMELIA I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try. \nBill's small smile.   Maybe the girl's all right. \nEXT. DOCK - LATER \nGeorge and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights of Boston glimmer across the harbor. His head is down. She's watching his profile. \nAMELIA Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth shut. \nGEORGE What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile. \nH e meant that.   And she seems oddly touched. \nAMELIA Careful.    I could get to like it. No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her decide. And then... She reaches to clasp his hand.   Hops down beside him. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything. \nGEORGE (a smile) Simpkin. \nAMELIA It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching. \nEXT. ROOF, COPLEY PLAZA HOTEL - DAY \nAmelia in a flying outfit.   Hands on her hips as if posing. \nAMELIA (V.O.) There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin. PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston. \nT \nA \nAMELIA (V.O.) He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored. We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is labeled `LUCKY LINDY.' \nAMELIA (V.O.) THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace. The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh in a different pose. \nAMELIA What are you boys doing over there? \nGEORGE Trying to make you look like a girl. George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to Lindbergh's angle. \nMELIA (V.O.) I wondered.     Was I Mr. Putnam's 43rd mouse?     Or his 307th. Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face... \nG \nEORGE he more we can make you look like a girl, the better. \nAMELIA Oh god, is it worth the effort? He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not. \nGEORGE Wondering who should play you in the film of all this. I'm thinking Chaplin. \nAMELIA Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs? The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.   They keep POPPING as Amelia makes her way to them. \nBILL Don't blame us, lady. I think somebody's starting to sell books. The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR \nATLANTIC HOP. There beneath the headline, the glamorous PHOTO we watched being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy. Next to it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker. \nA melia is sifting through the other papers, grinning and shaking her head. \nEPORTER Say, Amelia. What have you got for Mabel Boll to chew on? \nAMELIA Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold. The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US! \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Hey, not even silver. The boys make room.   Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair.    A friendly murmur... \nBILL The ham's a little tough, Commander. But the bacon's swell. \nINT. WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - DAY \nMOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature fanfare theme. Once more, the hotel conference room jammed with press. Today Mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat, shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium. Flashes start POPPING. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, upstaged by upstart social worker, seems madder than a rich wet hen. Hey Mabel, tell us about your rival! The sound switches to Mabel leaning her sultry voice to the mikes... \nMABEL Well, how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man? Reporters furiously writing, more flashes EXPLODE. \nMABEL (CONT'D) Bill Stultz and I were going to make history together, until this poor little social worker and her sugar daddy, oh excuse me, `publisher,' started throwing money and I don't know what else at him. \nR \nEPORTER Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot? \nMABEL I don't know, Charlie, I never seen her. Has she got any? LAUGHTER, they're all calling out.   She shows them a smoky smile, but stays on message. \nMABEL (CONT'D) Well, she had to use something on somebody to get from nowhere to here. You figure it out, or wait til George Putnam feeds it to you. Two dozen questions at once.   She's not even listening. \nMABEL (CONT'D) We're going to Canada, waiting for some good weather on the Atlantic, and then we'll kick Little Miss Whoozis in the keester. \nREPORTER What makes you so cocky that she won't leave first? \nMABEL Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to go to China. That thing they're flying can't load enough gas to make Yonkers. Tell that to Putnam's girlie. And while you're at it... She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her. \nMABEL (CONT'D) Tell her I do wear silver.   So I'm two up on her. \nEXT. HARBOR, TREPASSEY, NEWFOUNDLAND - EARLY MORNING \nMOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. We are looking at foggy, bleak Trepassey Harbor as the Friendship makes an unsuccessful attempt to take off. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) Eleven days of failure for plucky Amelia Earhart and her crew. If it isn't storms over the Atlantic, it's the inability of the seaplane's pontoons to lift from the sea. \nS ERIES OF ANGLES.    One failed take-off after another. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Perhaps it's for the best. Remember, no woman has beat the jinx of the Atlantic and three have died trying. Including a princess and the niece of former President Woodrow Wilson. The plane's engine SPUTTERS and STALLS.     It floats on the sea. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Maybe this one's not to be. Hey, Mabel! How's your weather report? \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, NEWFOUNDLAND - LATE NIGHT \nAmelia coming down the hotel corridor. She passes a room, and hearing DRUNKEN LAUGHTER from a group of MEN within the room... She stops.    Stares at the door with more concern than anger. \nA \nINT. ROOM - SAME MOMENT \nBill, Slim and three of the REPORTERS are drinking up a storm. \nBILL \nEXPLORER, MY ASS. BYRD COULDN'T \nFIND A PUBIC HAIR IN A WHOREHOUSE \nT RUSH HOUR! \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, NEWFOUNDLAND - LATER \nSHERIFF (CONT'D) Because you're stuck with it. From here on. She is brought to a smiling avuncular HILTON RAILEY, standing beside the closest thing Burry Port has to a limo. She throws an affectionate arm around him, kisses his cheek. \nAMELIA Hullo, Hilton. Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.   He's brought photographers with him. And more. \nR \nAILEY Amelia, say hullo to Allen Raymond of the New York Times. A hearty handshake.   She holds out her sheets of paper. \nAMELIA I believe you've come for these. Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.     Come for these indeed. \nEXT. SOUTHAMPTON - DAY \nMOVIETONE FOOTAGE of Amelia being welcomed by a SEA OF PEOPLE on the dock at Southampton. A mob . Folks spilling into the water. Ships circling, fireboats spray, every craft BLARES its horn. Police hold back the screaming throng as FLASHES EXPLODE and NEWSREEL CAMERAS CHURN. Amelia at the center of the storm. Welcomed by AMY GUEST and the lady LORD MAYOR of Southampton. Throughout, we see SUPERIMPOSED IMAGES of the article she gave Railey, displaying her byline, on the front pages of the London Times, New York Times, the Times of India, Sydney Morning Herald, the Toronto Star, Le Monde, as her story echoes around the world. These IMAGES CONTINUE OVER... \nQUICK SERIES OF ANGLES. Amelia cheering animatedly at the races...watching tennis at Wimbledon...front row gallery at the House of Commons, as... \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) A whirlwind week for Boston's Amelia Earhart, our own Lady Lindy. Races at Ascot on Gold Cup day...watching Helen Wills Moody play at Wimbledon...Lady Astor's 3              guest at the House of Commons... \nINT. HYDE PARK HOTEL, LONDON - DAY \nMOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. The British press are gathered in a huge Victorian parlor. Dark woods, rich leather, a bank of microphones, an electric expectancy... Bill and Slim stand next to a seated Amy.    Amelia steps to the microphones... \nAMELIA I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise... \nREPORTER (calls out) But you can fly, can't you? Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas. \nAMELIA This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record. \nREPORTER So you could have done it yourself! \nAMELIA This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man. Such calm self-possession.    Such confidence in that. \nY \nS \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Aviation is clear today for the pioneer. And if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether P            the pioneer is a man or woman. olite applause.       Mostly from women.   She looks around the room. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) I hear your doubt. That doubt is our challenge. This is where our Atlantic flight, or any other good flight by a woman can help... She nods.    To them, to herself. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) It starts women thinking. \nEXT. BROADWAY, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nTicker tape PARADE down Broadway, crowds lining the streets, leaning from windows to welcome Amelia home. \nUPERIMPOSE:       NEW YORK CITY Amelia sits in an open car between Bill and Slim, WAVING to everyone. In the front seat, George and Dorothy share the moment. \nEXT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY \nAmelia flanked by George and Dorothy, coming out of a reception hall. Amelia glances to George... \nAMELIA Guess you can burn those letters. Dorothy wonders.       Letters? \nGEORGE I saved them for your book. One simple shake of Amelia's head.       A soft... \nAMELIA The book's yours.     The letters are mine. He smiles.       Bows in submission. \nGEORGE ou're the boss. \nDOROTHY Hey, that's my job. (to Amelia) Do you think there's enough of him to boss for the two of us? Amelia still looking at George.    Laughs. \nAMELIA Barely enough for one. A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade. \nREPORTER Miss Earhart, can you tell us some- thing about your future plans? \nS he likes this question.    Fixes the man with that clear, honest gaze. \nAMELIA Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over. She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) ...if I haven't been fired. George holds the door of their limo. She looks up to him with a mischievous smile. And with no warning... ...Amelia bypasses the limo, climbs into the SIDECAR of a cop's motorcycle, and SMACKS its side. The cop looks up to George, who... ...nods, go for it. And the cop DOES, wheeling out into traffic, opening up the SIREN, as everyone laughs or cheers or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo. George watching her go.    Dorothy watching George. \nREPORTER Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social worker like Miss Earhart become comfortable as a celebrity so quickly? George smiles.   His eyes still following Amelia. \nAMELIA Feel like a drink? \nGEORGE Amelia!   What would her mother say? \nAMELIA Relax, George. I meant a Coke. As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others, the kid reacts. Oh, my. \nL ATER. Tea in the sitting room.    Elinor leaning forward, guileless, eager... \nELINOR They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit. \nGEORGE                          AMELIA On a bad week.                  On a good week. \nThe girl looks from one to the other. \nAMELIA All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real. \nELINOR Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling. It's why I'm here. \nGEORGE A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record, then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River. You don't seem to need much help selling yourself. \nELINOR Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her. Inadvertently, her eyes flick to the bedroom door. Catching this, our couple shares a dry smile. The kid sees that. Uh- oh. \nELINOR (CONT'D) What I mean is. It's a good thing. That's why I want it. Now our couple is trying not to laugh. \nGEORGE Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? ELINOR (straight back) To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot. The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically dumbstruck. \nAMELIA Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip? \nELINOR I do. \nAMELIA Keep doing what you're doing. The girl nods, seriously.    Okay. \nA \nMELIA (CONT'D) And don't let anyone turn you around. \nINT. PUTNAM HOUSE - CHRISTMAS DAY \nHoliday party in progress. Christmas decorations everywhere. A small crowd around the living room bar where George is telling a story. Now we see Dorothy standing, drinking, watching George with hard eyes. She turns on her heels and walks OUT into the garden. George sees this, excuses himself, follows her, as we PAN to... \n...Amelia standing with a group of guests.    She's seen it all. \nEXT. GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER \nHere she comes along the roses, still drinking, still fuming. A figure comes up behind her. Falls in step. \nGEORGE Lovely party, huh? \nDOROTHY Depends on your point of view. I've been listening to some idiot brag about his girlfriend. Still walking.   She never looks at him. \nGEORGE Well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind? \nDOROTHY It's not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket. It's just a pity we can't have one honest conversation about it. \nGEORGE What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department. She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our ANGLE we can now see D Amelia in the window, watching them. \nOROTHY If this is what you call an honest talk, I'd say you need some practice. \nGEORGE Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton. She stops walking.   Turns in shock, to see his easy smile. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Well, I'm waiting for our practice conversation. Hoping I'll learn something. About honesty. \nShe GLARES at him, and storms off. He lets her go. Hear a car engine TURN OVER. Dorothy PEELING OUT. George reflects. As he walks back toward the party, he now sees Amelia in the window. He stops. Their look holds. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT \nGeorge at the kitchen table in dim light. It's very late. A HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him. Followed by a slice of pie. A fork. He smiles. And softly... \nGEORGE Dorothy and I are through. She sits beside him.     Very close. \nAMELIA For a long, long time. \nGEORGE It's different now. She looks at him.   Squints.    How? \nGEORGE She probably meant me. So honest, the words confuse her. \nELINOR Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat. \nGEORGE Oh, sure she does. A straight smile... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) She just doesn't care. ...which silently fades. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) My job.     Is to care for her. \nDISSOLVE TO... \nY \nS \nW \nINT. OAK ROOM, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nLONG ANGLE. Sophisticated watering hole. Crowded tonight. PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not returned. We CLOSE as they sit... \nGEORGE \nA hat's wrong? MELIA (clearly furious) What could be wrong? I had such a lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith. Oh. \nGEORGE he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true. \nAMELIA And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE (calm, straight) Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this. \nAMELIA What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work? \nGEORGE I didn't say that. \nAMELIA Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but... \nGEORGE ou're making your life hap... \nAMELIA But this is different. It is. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) If women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere. \nI \nF \nT \nAre you listening? \nGEORGE rom here on, I'll just stab men in he back. A \nMELIA You didn't do this for business, anyway.   G \nEORGE I did it for fun? \nAMELIA You did it because you love me. That stops him. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) And when we're married, you mustn't ever... Now she stops.      Because his eyes are wide. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married. Full beat. \nGEORGE did.   I do. \nAMELIA Well, then. His eyes moving over her face. \nGEORGE What about what you said? The day S            will come when you run away. he nods.    It will. \nAMELIA You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. And yet. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry. Tears stand in his eyes.       He is so happy. \nAMELIA (a whisper) (CONT'D) Yes? GEORGE (a whisper) Hell yes. \nA reaches now, starts REPACKING her soil... \nMELIA (CONT'D) But you don't think that, do you, ear? \nGEORGE Of course not. But if I did... She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) ...all the more reason to say yes. \nEXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT - DUSK \nAERIAL ANGLE. In the sun's last light, two figures walk slowly, far below us. The Vega waits. CLOSE ANGLE. They stand beneath the wing. Her ground crew in far distance, giving them their moment. Her look is not breezy and cavalier this time, but tender and intimate. She knows the fear beneath his easy smile. He produces a RING, a band of black fibers. \nGEORGE Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your toe. It's good luck. He puts it in her hand. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Anyway. That's what the elephant told me. Amelia looks at the ring.   Turns it in her fingers. \nAMELIA I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is... She glances up. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) We make our own luck, you and I. Remember that. He will remember that.    And more. \nGEORGE Do you have money? \nAMELIA No. He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.      Hands it to her. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) All this? G \nEORGE Sure. \nAMELIA Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half. \nGEORGE I spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back. It's non-refundable. So try to do your part. She nods.   She'll try.   He doesn't want to leave her yet. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) So the Simpkin thing. What was all that? \nAMELIA I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? He shakes his head. GEORGE (very soft) Either way, something to look forward to. She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave him either. \nAMELIA (murmurs) Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and... And. AMELIA (a whisper) I want to see their heads high. When I come home. She leans up to kiss him. And again.    Feeling in her eyes that he will never forget. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) See ya. \nINT. VEGA - NIGHT \nAmelia alone. Starry night.   12,000 feet below are ICEBERGS. A single fishing boat. \nAMELIA (V.O.) The weather report wasn't perfect. But we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn't. Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight.   Too high to fly over. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five years to the day from Lindbergh's flight. It was too good a sell for George to resist. 5              What we didn't know... \nEXT. VEGA - LATER \nA terrifying STORM BATTERS the plane, which bobs and darts and dips like a leaf in a gale. \nAMELIA (V.O.) ...was that my altimeter would conk out. Never to return. \nINT. VEGA - SAME MOMENT \nAmelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN. \nAMELIA (V.O.) The only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea. \n(MORE) \nAMELIA(cont'd) When the engines sputtered, that was my low-level limit. A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the nose UP, the engine COUGHS... ...and CLIMBS. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. The joke was... LATER.   Flying in and out of cloud cover. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) All those months flying only with instruments, I should have been practicing without them. PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I started to wonder if luck was paying me back. For thinking I knew the rules. A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then I smelled burning oil. She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in the manifold ring.  A \nMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) A bad weld, already a small flame. It would be hours back to Canada, trying to find an unlit field, landing with a heavy fuel load. She stares at the little flame.   Is it growing bigger? \nEXT. NEW YORK HARBOR- DAY \nMOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of Amelia arriving at New York Harbor to an overwhelming reception. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) Amelia Earhart arrives to a tumul- tuous New York reception after her whirlwind tour of Europe, in which our Queen of the Skies danced with her royal counterpart the Prince of Wales, before meeting both Benito Mussolini and the Pope. The MAYOR, the GOVERNOR, every dignitary that could get an invitation is there to greet her. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) The second human to fly the Atlantic solo, she is the only one ever to fly it twice. And she set the record, man or woman, for the fastest crossing. Fourteen hours 54 minutes. As she waves to the crowd... \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Now it's America's turn to show our girl what we think of her! \nDISSOLVE TO... \nINT. BACKSTAGE, CONSTITUTIONAL HALL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT \nWe are standing in the wings. Through the curtains, we GLIMPSE the eager, packed house in an auditorium. From the stage, a speaker DRONES, but backstage... ...George peeks out at the throng. When he looks back, we see Amelia, her troubled face. The folded newspaper in her hand. \nG \nW \nW \nAMELIA (reads) `Only an average flyer, she has pushed herself to the front by following the tactics of the feminists... She looks up to him. \nGEORGE ell, I'm glad someone besides me finally noticed. His smile is light.    Her eyes watching him.   Then... AMELIA (reads) `Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.' She stares at the paper.    His voice comes gently... \nGEORGE hy would you even read that garbage? \nAMELIA Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble. \nGEORGE ood. And remembering how little you owe me keeps me humble. And softly... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) He's a crackpot. Let it go. He points to the packed hall... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Cheer up.     They're crazy about you. AMELIA (quiet) Well, they're crazy about something. She looks down.   Self-doubt flickers. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) What have we really done? \nGEORGE You've made them feel like this. \nAMELIA That's not enough. \nGEORGE Most of them are women. And for them, it's very much enough. She shakes her head. \nAMELIA The World Telegram said, `a magnificent display of useless courage.' \nGEORGE The question is. Can any magnif- icent display of courage be use- less?     A \nMELIA The point is. Men do it every day. And no one throws a parade. Ah.   Well... \nGEORGE One day closer, then. To the day when they won't think to throw one for you. She doesn't turn.   She doesn't smile. \nAMELIA Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. He nods to himself. \nGEORGE And.   It's fun. From the stage... \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) \nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE \nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HAIL TO THE CHIEF strikes up. We hear the deep applause. George begins to straighten Amelia's outfit, touching her hair, as he did long ago on the Copley Hotel roof. \nPRESIDENT HOOVER (O.S.) \nTHE GOLD MEDAL OF THE NATIONAL GEO- \nGRAPHIC SOCIETY WAS LAST AWARDED \nFIVE YEARS AGO TO COL. CHARLES \nLINDBERGH. George murmurs close to her ear... \nGEORGE If a bomb goes off tonight, the whole government of the United States is out there... \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) As a result, he was basically a single parent to their young son, Gore. He glances at his watch.      Wow. \nGENE I'm rattling on here, and you've got a morning train. But she's just staring in his eyes.   This could be her last chance to ask... \nAMELIA How's Nina doing? \nGENE Oh, fine. Really?   He smiles, gently. \nGENE (CONT'D) Actually, she hasn't been feeling her best. She'll probably summer in Newport. So my kid's stuck with Dad again. \nAMELIA If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes. \nGENE You suggesting you're less boring than I am? \nAMELIA Well, yeh. He smiles first.    Hers is slower, but here it comes. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches. A full beat.    He's deciding. \nGENE Gore would love that. He has a little crush, I'm afraid. \nAMELIA At seven? \nGENE He's eight. Well, then. He breaks the look.     Fishes out some cash for the bar tab.        G \nENE (CONT'D) Listen, Paul and I would be thrilled to rope you into our shuttle. \nAMELIA Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure. He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding. \nGENE The next adventure.    What is it? She shrugs.    No idea. \nGENE (CONT'D) Because we're running out of oceans. \nAMELIA Wish you'd do something about that. \nGENE I'm serious, Amelia. Her soft smile. \nAMELIA I know.   Always. \nGENE The only way you can stay where you are. And be who you are... Serious indeed. \nGENE (CONT'D) Is to keep feeding the beast. She can't smile anymore.     Because this is the very fear she lives with. \nGENE (CONT'D) And the beast always needs something larger, greater, more daring... AMELIA (quiet) He costs money, too. \nGENE The price of fame, literally. Do you and George talk about this? Silence. \nAMELIA We don't have to. \nGENE With all respect.    Yes, you do. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER \nWalking together down the hallway of her hotel. No one speaks. Their thoughts are their own. She reaches her room, finds her key. Opens the door, and... ...turns to him. A brief, direct look.       She reaches one hand gently behind his head. Leans up. \nK isses his mouth. AMELIA (a whisper) Thank you. His eyes question. \nT \nT \nH \nAMELIA For understanding. There is no smile. Without a word, she goes into her room. CLOSES the door behind her. e stands alone. Do I knock on that door?     Then, smiles to himself, and simply... Walks away. \nDISSOLVE TO... \nINT. BANQUET HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT \nCrowded hall, each table ringed by diners in formal dress. At a table of honor, George sits next to Elinor Smith, chatting comfortably. PAN to the head table... \nGEORGE (V.O.) After Roosevelt won, his wife Eleanor brought the advancement of women to national attention with stunning success. CLOSE on ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, eating heartily, chatting, laughing with a companion we don't see until... \nGEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) A gutsy gal who rode a bobsled in he Winter Olympics, spent hours each morning on horseback, and carried a pistol on car trips. She possessed boundless energy, a towering intellect... ...we reveal Amelia in a formal satin dress at her side, dishing with the First Lady like the closest of girlfriends. \nA \nAMELIA(cont'd) me to build a women's careers department there. Really?   He likes that. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) I'll be back and forth. When I'm there, I've asked to stay in the dorm with the girls. \nGENE That's a wonderful idea. Especially now. Something in the way he said that. \nAMELIA What's special about now? \nGENE A good time for some positive press about you as a role model. Her eyes harden.   Whatever do you mean? \nGENE (CONT'D) You don't read the papers? \nAMELIA Not unless someone makes me. \nGENE Well, someone should. Because they're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity. Meaning, money. Dead.   Silence.     G \nENE (CONT'D) They also harp on a growing list of products that you commercially endorse. \nAMELIA How thoughtless of me to be doing ll this in a society where no one else is interested in making money. Present company included. He's not afraid of her. \nI \nI \nO \nG \nH \nI \nA \nS \nF \nGENE Look, George had you taking money rom the sugar cartel for the Hawaii flight, the Mexican Government for theirs, he's selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights... \nAMELIA If this is about George, just say o. Because we made those calls, nd we includes me. \nGENE I'm sorry I said it that way. This s actually about you, because I'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about. \nAMELIA And what's your point? Women are eld to some higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? ENE (quietly) Of course they are. \nAMELIA Well, let's change that, shall we? r would you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier. Staring at each other. \nGENE If you want to make money, my guess s that people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful. \nAMELIA Thanks for the tip. \nGENE Thanks for not being defensive. Full beat. \nT \nAMELIA Well, I'm an open-minded girl. And o prove it, I'm hereby resigning as your consultant at the S            Aeronautics Branch. he throws some money on the table for the drinks. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together. She stands up. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Next time you read the papers.      Try reading between the lines. Walks out.       Gene makes no move to follow.   He's said his piece. \nDISSOLVE TO... \nEXT. ROSE GARDEN, WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nMOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE introduced by its theme. Against a backdrop of flowerbeds, Amelia is flanked by four WOMEN with conservative hats and middle-aged gravitas. The photographers edge closer. \nAMELIA I came to Washington today with the National Women's Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia Mott Amendment for equal rights. She waits for the press to quiet. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) And that's because I haven't needed it. The winsome smile. \nAMELIA And your surprise is, you robbed a bank. \nGEORGE Actually.    A university. They stop.    What on earth...? \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I've sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue. And suggested a budget item of... He shrugs. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) ...oh, eighty grand. For a suitable `flying laboratory.' Her eyes just bug out.      No!   He nods, slowly.   Uh-huh.   And she... ...THROWS her arms around his neck, KISSING him hard enough \nG to startle passersby. It only makes him chuckle. \nEORGE (CONT'D) As I said, I've sort of persuaded Ed. There are a bunch of trustees and donors, tho. We have to get them on board. \nAMELIA Think I could help? He looks in her eyes. \nGEORGE Nah. She grins. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) By the way. That's not the surprise. It's not?    Uh-uh.   And he glances to... ...the window of the GALLERY they've stopped at. She sees a magnificently carved CHEST. On a crest in the front: AE. We PAN the surface, to see planes, oceans, a shamrock for the Londonderry landing, dozens more symbols of her triumphs, and in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder... ...a small cat.     In a long frock coat. GEORGE (a whisper) Merry Christmas. Her tears just come. She's standing on Park Avenue and she can't do anything about it. He reaches a tender hand... ...and strokes her hair.      He is her hero.   See it in her eyes. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Can't wait to see what you got me. She sniffles. \nAMELIA Cat food.    A whole case. \nINT. HOME, RYE - DAY \nAmelia at her writing desk.       Determined, focused.   She begins to write... \nAMELIA (O.S.) Dear Mr. President: Some time ago I told you and Mrs. Roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight. The chief problem is the jump westward from Honolulu... \nA s she writes, DISSOLVE TO... \nINT. DINING ROOM, PURDUE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT \nA glittering table surrounded by high rollers. George and President Elliot sit on either side of Amelia, who has risen to speak. \nAMELIA As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue. She looks into the eyes of each in turn... \nAMELIA (CONT'D) It is much more. I believe that women should do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have not. Yes? \nAMELIA (CONT'D) This might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you gentlemen desire that. There is gentle laughter.   Amelia reacts in mock surprise. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) I know, of course, from my chats earlier in the evening. With each of your wives. More laughter.   Applause from a wife, then the others, then all. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) In that spirit, I want each of you to reach for your checkbooks... She regards their amusement.   And losing none of the warmth of her own smile... \nAMELIA (CONT'D) I mean that quite literally. This is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most. \nG eorge and Amelia gaze at each other. \nY \nA \nF \nA \nY \nAMELIA (CONT'D) The capacity. To be relentless. \nINT. HANGAR - DAY \nThe LOCKHEED ELECTRA, a sleek state-of-the-art aircraft with its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a huge space. Its engines are on hoists, being worked on by a team of MECHANICS. Eight-year-old Gore gazes up, as if he has never seen anything quite so wondrous. Amelia and Gene watch, with barely suppressed smiles. He's in a suit. She's in grease- stained overalls from working with the mechanics. \nGORE So you'd be the first one, right? ou always like that. First one? \nGORE (CONT'D) To fly around the world. \nAMELIA Well, there's Magellan, 400 years go. Actually, he didn't make it. And he died. And he used a boat. \nGORE So it's almost the same, except it's completely different. \nAMELIA Pretty much. He glowers at her.    She glowers back. \nGENE (CONT'D) This is Howland Island. It's half- way between Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists. \nAMELIA It's your vacation home. \nGENE We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there. She blinks.   The Japanese. \nGENE (CONT'D) Try reading the newspapers between he lines. We haven't started building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew could get the President's attention... She stares at the map.   The dot. \nGENE (CONT'D) It's really tiny, a grain of sand n the middle of a thousand miles f nowhere. Her eyes are clicking through a calculus of their own. \nGENE (CONT'D) \nF You'd need a first-class navigator or that leg. Which means the trip can't be entirely solo. And softly... \nGENE (CONT'D) Can you handle that? \nT \nNo answer.       He waits without saying a word. AMELIA (softly back) Don't rush me. I'm thinking. \nEXT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nA Coast Guard station overlooking the Pacific. A lone woman leans on a railing. From the station, a MAN emerges, he has... ...a thermos and two large mugs. He pours steaming coffee into each, and brings them to the woman at the rail. She has turned to study him as he approaches. \nAMELIA Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you. She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug... \nFRED I hear you like your coffee black. \nAMELIA This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs. His slight grin.       A handsome guy. \nFRED Be right back. \nAMELIA Over easy on the eggs.      Your job could depend on it. Silence between them.       Comfortable smiles. \nFRED Are we sizing me up? And, of course, this is exactly what she's doing. \nAMELIA I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities. \nFRED Maybe, maybe not. 20% it works. 0% you crash. 60% you don't get he fuel, so you're cooked anyway. \nE \nP \nAMELIA Better odds of hitting that island? \nF \nRED How do you feel about 100%? Watching his eyes as he says that.    Evaluating. \nAMELIA Even with cloud cover? \nFRED I've crossed the Pacific by air 18 times. Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen. \nAMELIA They did. \nFRED Someone else told you I have a drinking problem. Which is a big art of why we're here, yes? No answer. \nFRED (CONT'D) Pan Am will tell you. Everyone I ver worked for will tell you. Nothing's interfered with my performance. Not once. \nAMELIA My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul. \nFRED You trusted Bill Stultz. That worked out. Rest his soul. \nAMELIA Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet. He shakes his head. \nFRED That's what you're looking for. I'm looking for coordinates on a map. And if it doesn't work... He spreads his large hands... \nT \nI \nFRED (CONT'D) Money-back guarantee. She holds the look. AMELIA (softly) Hey.   How can I lose? \nhe looks wildly around to... ..George, who's there, SNATCHING the receiver. \nVOICE (O.S.) Have you heard? They crashed, the ship's in flames. SMASH CUT to the cockpit, the Electra SPINNING crazily on its belly, SPARKS EVERYWHERE, the plane suddenly comes... ...to a BONE-JARRING STOP. The right MOTOR is pushed up INTO its wing, which itself has BUCKLED, the stabilizer BENT, the left wing extends UPWARD from scraping the runway, the landing gear no longer exists. SIRENS SCREAM as fire trucks and ambulances race toward them. Amelia is ashen, disbelieving. Next to her, a gentle... \nFRED Good reaction, cutting the switch. You saved our ass. She doesn't even hear, THROWING open the cockpit, WAVING to signal they're all right, we SMASH CUT TO... \nEXT. OAKLAND AIRPORT - DAY \nGeorge wandering numbly on the airfield, as someone RUNS LIKE CRAZY from the office, shouting... \nMAN \nNO FIRE! NO FIRE, FALSE REPORT! \nO ONE HURT! George alone on the tarmac.   Stops in his tracks.   Now he can cry. \nI \nT \nEXT. GARDEN, LOS ANGELES HOME - ALMOST SUNRISE \nTwo figures in a garden, walking in light so spare they are silhouettes. Her head is down. His hands are in his pockets. We CLOSE on them as she fingers a blossom, we now see she is miserable, fighting absolute despair. \nGEORGE Three weeks, she'll be good as new. It's a remarkable crew. The best \nT hat... He stops.   Realizing where he was going.   She never looks up. \nAMELIA ...the best that money can buy. I just can't believe I've done this o us. All the money wasted that's never coming back. \nGEORGE You cut the engines. It would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned-up plane. Not to mention pilot. She shakes her head.    No. \nAMELIA I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle. Tears stand in her eyes. She is so ashamed and remorseful. He lets it stay silent as they walk. Then... \nGEORGE t's only money, we'll figure it out. We always do. \nAMELIA I'll make it back and more, I promise. The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years. \nGEORGE Maybe.   Or... \nAMELIA No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are going to double. \n(MORE) \nW \nA \nAMELIA(cont'd) This showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted... \n(SNIFFLES) They thought I was competent. GEORGE (softly) I meant.    Or maybe we can quit. She looks over.    Not sure if... \nAMELIA You mean after. \nGEORGE Or.     Even now. A strong smile.    He nods.     We could. \nAMELIA So my exit would be a stupid crash. nd withdrawing from a world- publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before. \nGEORGE Yeh. That. And it would be fine ith me. Her eyes overwhelmed A his offer. by                  Her voice soft with... \nMELIA But that's because you're an idiot. \nGEORGE Lucky for you. A held beat. \nAMELIA And what if it's not something I have to show the world? Hmmn? \nAMELIA What if it's something I have to show me. He has no answer for that.       Takes her hand.   They head toward the house. \nINT. HANGAR - NIGHT \nMassive enclosed space. The rebuilt Electra in pieces at various work stations, being perfected by teams of mechanics. \nT \nO \nT \nO \nAMELIA I'll be flying sky no one's ever been in. You made that happen. She looks down to his easy smile. \nGEORGE Hate to think where you'd be without me. She smiles back.       Tenderness we don't always see. \nAMELIA I'll try to make you proud. \nGEORGE You did that long, long ago. Only ne person left to prove yourself o. Just make sure you do it. \nA beat.   The doubt comes. \nAMELIA And then what? \nGEORGE Then the best part.    The future. She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him. AMELIA (a whisper) Oh yeh.    That. She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep. Longing. Her body sinks into him. LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other. \nEXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - DAY \nLONG ANGLE. From the open door of a hangar we see Amelia and George facing reporters in front of the idling Electra. She sits on the wing, he's just beneath her. \nGEORGE (V.O.) The radio problems crept up on us ver time. \nSUPERIMPOSE:      MIAMI AIRPORT.   JUNE 1. \nGEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The marine 500 kilocycle radio was left in Oakland. Amelia said she \n(MORE) \nC \nGEORGE(cont'd) and Fred were both amateurs at Morse Code, so the radio wasn't worth what it weighed. Amelia has made the boys laugh.    George laughs with them. \nGEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The 250 foot trailing auxiliary antenna, she would leave behind in Miami. Too heavy, not important. FLASHES now. And plenty of them. She reaches down to take George's hand and HOPS down from the wing. More FLASHES... \nGEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then, suddenly our remaining radio ouldn't reach its designated frequencies. Pan Am hurriedly replaced the main antennae. And we thought all was well. Amelia and George coming toward us now, hand in hand, leaving the press behind. Into... The hangar. In shadow here.     The world far away, she takes his hands. A silence. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Race you to California. I'll go west. Five bucks? \nAMELIA If you'll fly the plane.   Make it twenty. And then... \nAMELIA (CONT'D) Simpkin keeps many mice at one time. Each under a different teacup. Wow.   He's finally going to hear this. \nGEORGE We're saying he's cruel? \nAMELIA No. \nGEORGE Controlling? \nAMELIA Insecure. \nI \nT \nAh.   The light begins to dawn. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) He needs the illusion of activity o feel comfortable. That he's preparing for all contingencies. George has to grin. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) That he has more irons in the \nF ire than anyone knows. \nGEORGE Especially the mice. \nAMELIA Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it's all about her. Staring at each other. \nGEORGE And one of them.    Is right. AMELIA (a murmur) She knows. And then... \nGEORGE want you to give me something. He's never sounded quite like this before. \nEXT. ELECTRA - LATER \nA wrenching battle, plane versus monsoon. The storm is heavier, deafening, actually STRIPPING PAINT from the Electra's wings. \nINT. ELECTRA - SAME MOMENT \nAmelia beyond exhaustion, but focused, fighting it.      We think she's flying alone. Until... ...Fred drops into the seat beside her. No words as he watches her struggle. Our plane is all over the sky. The DIN is ungodly. \nAMELIA \nYOU THINK WE SHOULD TURN BACK, HUH? \nFRED \nNOPE.     I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE \nCOME. An AIR POCKET DROPS them 200 feet. \nAMELIA \nHARD TO IMAGINE LANDING IN THIS. \nFRED \nI'VE GOT AN IDEA.     LET'S NEVER COME \nDOWN. She glances over.    For once, she's scared. \nAMELIA \nHOW COULD YOU FIND OUR WAY BACK? \nFRED \nSINCE I FORGOT TO DROP BREAD \nCRUMBS, WE'LL HAVE TO USE DEAD \nRECKONING. Beat. \nAMELIA \nTHAT'S IT?     JUST A GUESS? \nI \nF \nFRED \nUS NAVIGATORS PREFER THE TERM `WILD- \nASS GUESS.' Held look. \nAMELIA That's more like it. She starts to TURN the plane around. \nINT. ELECTRA - DAY \nAmelia flying down through heavy turbulence, though it is no longer raining. Her features tense. We see the accumulated strain of the adventure. \nF red appears from the catwalk, slips into the seat beside her. He's worried. Points, and we see... ...CALCUTTA below, sprawling and endless. Between us and the ground, a huge gathering of FLYING SHAPES. \nRED Black eagles. If one of those clips a propeller. Or flies into the engine... Her tired features form a smile. \nAMELIA 've got an idea. Let's never land. Better safe than sorry. He takes her point.    She turns back to work... \nAMELIA (CONT'D) I'll wake you when the coffee's ready. And with cold-blooded nerve, she SWOOPS down, down, THROUGH the flock of eagles, scattering them as we arc in for a perfect landing. She never turns to... ...Fred, who is still white-knuckling, trying to get his heart started. He can't believe what she's just done. Rolling, rolling... \nFRED Cream, no sugar. \nA \nEXT. GOVERNOR'S HOUSE, CALCUTTA - TWILIGHT \nAMELIA (CONT'D) You show up tomorrow morning. You show up sober and you get me to Howland Island. Okay? \nAMELIA (CONT'D) And I'll forget you ever said that. She WHEELS around and holding her slicker over her head, goes OFF into the POUNDING RAIN. Fred's smile is gone.     He stares after her. \nDISSOLVE TO... \nEXT. RADIO HUT, LAE - LATER \nAmelia down the path in her slicker toward a small hut.       She knocks. Opens the door to reveal... \nINT. RADIO HUT - NIGHT \n...the radio receiver and transmitter.     The operator BALFOUR is a wiry Scot. He nods respectfully. \nBALFOUR Ready, Mum. He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't understand. AMELIA (gently) Feel like stepping out for a smoke...? \nBALFOUR I don't smoke. \nAMELIA ...or something? Oh.   The monsoon beats down. \nBALFOUR If you need help, I'll be right outside. In the rain. \nAMELIA Thank you.     I'll only be a moment. \nI \nG \nHe puts on his slicker.   OPENS an umbrella.    Leaves. She looks back to the radio.   FLIPS the switch. E         AMELIA (soft) arhart here. \nINTERCUT:   COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - DAY \nGeorge at a window, looking west.     Over the Pacific.   She's there somewhere. \nEORGE You should be sleeping. He smiles to keep his voice up. The eyes aren't smiling.       We INTERCUT their conversation throughout... \nAMELIA You should be working. \nGEORGE I'm running a big adventure here, 'm a very important fellow. \nAMELIA You told me I was the star.   And you were no one at all. GEORGE (soft) I thought I was lying. Guess the joke's on me. Silence. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) How's Fred? \nAMELIA I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay? \nGEORGE Don't keep me waiting. \nAMELIA I won't dare. You're a very important feline. Uh, fellow. \nGEORGE Talk to me about Fred. \nAMELIA Fred is fine. He's calculating head-wind speed versus fuel as we speak. CLOSE on his face. \nGEORGE You wouldn't sell a salesman would you? \nAMELIA He's fine. \nGEORGE So what's that I hear in     your voice? A beat. \nGEORGE Is he drinking? AMELIA (soft) I can handle it. \nGEORGE Call it off. Right now.      I mean it. \nAMELIA I can handle it. And then... \nAMELIA I love you. Silence. \nGEORGE After the Fourth.     We're going home. \nAMELIA Where's that? \nGEORGE For me?   Anywhere you are. She begins to cry. Both hands fly to her mouth and she looks away. She swallows hard. \nEXT. HOWLAND ISLAND - DAY \nERIAL ANGLE. A tiny, flat, nearly invisible speck adrift in the endless Pacific. Howland Island. PAN to see just offshore... \nGEORGE (V.O.) The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca had been anchored off Howland just for us. CLOSE on the ITASCA now... \nGEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Its radio would be her lifeline. Its black plume of smoke would reach for miles. More visible than the island itself. DISSOLVE TO NIGHT. The island visible only by its slender LIGHTHOUSE. The ship illuminated in the darkness. CLOSE now on a path by the sea. A lone figure with a FLASHLIGHT approaches a SHACK. Enters... \nINT. RADIO HUT - NIGHT \n...a room filled with radio equipment.

Amelia's friend runs for her life. But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the plane... ...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the slender girl with her outstretched arms. LOUDER and FASTER, as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. The aircraft SCREAMS past, just above her head. \nAMELIA (V.O.) As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me.

And then you'll have opportunities to work in aviation. Anywhere you want. She laughs. \nAMELIA Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation. She looks up at his eyes. \nI         AMELIA (CONT'D) 'm not going anywhere, social work is my life.

Its red-orange fuselage stands beside gigantic PONTOONS, each 29 feet long. The pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to the plane. They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with quick eyes. Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not necessarily happy to see us. \nAMELIA (V.O.) George had told me Stultz was Adm. Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. He drank. But George said it never affected his work. George waves as we approach.   Bill and Amelia seem locked on each other. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) When he said it, I must have had a funny look. So I just said, `Yeh, I grew up around a guy like that.' \nGEORGE Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart. \nAMELIA We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.'

Dazed, she sees Bill turned around... \nBILL \nHOLD ONTO SOMETHING FOR CHRISSAKE! She GRABS the leg of the navigation table which has been bolted down. Stares out the window, wondering if she'll make it. \nAMELIA (V.O.) Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know that.

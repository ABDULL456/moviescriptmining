A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the- art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting. PULL BACK to see... \n...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open- sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And peering down through the mist and rain... \n...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane. Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her. Something fierce lives there. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   LAE, NEW GUINEA - 1937. \nFRED (O.S.) Sure I can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous? She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt- streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a Coke which he sets down for her. \nAMELIA Adventurous? You've got the wrong girl, Mister. You should know that by now. Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself four fingers. \nFRED Actually. I knew that the moment I met ol' George. He sips his drink.    She says nothing. \nFRED (CONT'D) I like how you don't talk about him. \nAMELIA That why I get so many chances to not do it? \nFRED Well.   Natural curiosity. His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila. She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her side of the table. \nFRED I mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show. Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail? \nNo response.   Just her clear direct gaze. \nFRED (CONT'D) I'll bet he knew that. First time he met you. \nShe looks out to sea. \nAMELIA He thought I hated him.      He never knew I was fascinated. \nINT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY \nAlone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now, there are none to be seen. Even as... ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad. Does he know she's there? \nSUPERIMPOSE:   NEW YORK, LATER 1937. \nGEORGE (without turning) The first time I met her she sat in that chair. The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And still with his back to her... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You may as well write it down, Mary. Write it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring. He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) We'll see if I remember how to edit. She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as... \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'd kept her waiting two hours. \nT She hated me on sight, but she hought I couldn't tell. His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was... His smile is kind.   And honestly self-mocking. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator. But then I guess you know all that, don't you? She looks up reproachfully.   Nothing of the kind, and you know it. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for compliments. He's made her laugh. \nDISSOLVE TO... \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nShe is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an exam. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS PUBLISHING CO. 1928. \nGEORGE (V.O.) The waiting made her furious. She undoubtedly felt I was \nE stablishing my dominance and importance. She doesn't look furious at all. Thumbing through WE by COL. CHARLES LINDBERGH. Photos of Lindy beside the Spirit of St. Louis in Paris. \n", "test1_true": "AMELIA (V.O.) I figured he'd be pompous. Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers, explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of George with the great Lindbergh. A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises, smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down the corridor. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever. They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly pushes it open... ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him, negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric, masterful. \nAMELIA (V.O) But to be rejected by this... parasite. A man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous. He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is there. Sit, please. But she doesn't. \nAMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk. He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze from him. He hangs up the phone. They stare at each other for a frozen beat.   He breaks the moment with a charming smile... \nGEORGE Miss Earhart? \nAMELIA Mr. Putnam? GEORGE (softly) I asked you to sit. \nAMELIA Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog. His smile now only a trace.       But more genuine. \nGEORGE A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like. melia sits. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'm told you want to fly the Atlantic Ocean. \nAMELIA I do. \nGEORGE In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died. \nAMELIA I'll make it. \nGEORGE Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which...is the real attraction for both of us, I suspect. She nods.    No smile. \nAMELIA Always nice to know what the real attraction is. His smile.    Beginning to enjoy this conversation. \nGEORGE The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement... He gestures.   Perhaps you. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) ...who is American, educated, well- spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive... \nAMELIA Why would that matter? \nGEORGE Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention. \nAMELIA Was that your advice? \nGEORGE Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name. Understood...?       G \nEORGE (CONT'D) But all the money from these will go to Mrs. Guest. \nAMELIA Except for the part that goes to you. \nGEORGE Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you. \nAMELIA You said she wants a flyer. \nGEORGE Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger. \nHe waits for reaction.   She keeps her mouth shut. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) That's good for your chances. Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at all. No punches pulled.   Not his style. \nAMELIA Why would anyone want a book from a passenger? \nGEORGE Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight. \nAMELIA Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan... \nGEORGE The job's yours. She blinks.   Stunned speechless. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I chose you the moment you walked through the door. He smiles his charming smile.    Several phones are RINGING. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise. May I give you a lift to the station? Amelia rises.   Is she pissed at being toyed with? \nAMELIA You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I can find my way. The look holds.   He shrugs.   You probably can. \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - LATER \nTwo figures on the platform.   Her train is ready to leave. \n", "test1_id": 2784, "test2_input": "AMELIA (CONT'D) So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?

For the first time, we can see the inside of the plane. The cabin is too small for anyone to stand. The plane has been emptied of everything but two huge elliptical FUEL TANKS. he wedges herself between the gigantic tanks. Bill pulls the throttle and the Fokker Tri-motor LURCHES forward, STRAINING against the surface of the sea in a rattling, throbbing desperately VIBRATING all-out attempt. \nAmelia crawls to the tiny window, her face to the glass as chop and spray FLY PAST like shrapnel, and the engines WHINE and PULSE louder... ...twenty seconds, thirty. Still on the surface. Forty seconds, fifty, her eyes shut, her forehead bangs against the glass, come on, sixty seconds, and at 67... \nEXT. HARBOR - SAME MOMENT \n...the seaplane LIFTS, struggles, then SOARS FREE. \nINT. FRIENDSHIP - DAY/NIGHT \nAmelia kneels at the tiny window. A kid on a rainy day. Only outside this window is impenetrable FOG and a STORM that ROCKS the plane like the shock waves of endless explosions. As she braces herself against the hull... ...water DRIPS onto her from a loose seam. Could this be dangerous? She looks around. Through the opening between the elliptical fuel tanks... ...Bill and Slim at the controls. Bill is banging on something beside the instrument panel. Beneath his seat, she sees the TOOLBOX. The water drips on her faster. She crawls forward toward the boys, arriving to see... ...Bill POUNDING what we can now see is his RADIO.   His face is red, angry. She watches for a beat. \nAMELIA \nYOU OKAY? \nBILL \nBE BETTER IF OUR DAMN RADIO WOULD \nJOIN THE PARTY! He never turns to her, but she studies him. Is he impaired or simply frustrated? She slips the toolbox from beneath his seat and crawls back to the leak. But as she opens the box... ...there, among the wrench and pliers, a BOTTLE of whiskey. She stares at it as we SNAP TO... \nFLASHBACK:    EXT. AMELIA'S HOUSE, ATCHISON, KANSAS - DAY \nRAPID SERIES OF ANGLES. War-painted Amelia looking up from the cowboy she's tied to a tree. The car pulling to the curb. Out climbs... \n...her FATHER glassy-eyed.   Stumbling through the children. Her MOTHER at the door. ANGLE. Amelia still in war paint enters her parents' room She knows just where to go. Opens a drawer, digs beneath crisply starched shirts. Finds the BOTTLE. ANGLE. Amelia in the bathroom, POURING the bottle out into the sink. She looks up in the mirror to see... ...her father in the doorway. She turns straight to him. MEETS his eyes, direct and unafraid. \nINT. FRIENDSHIP \nBACK to Amelia with Bill's bottle, as the battered plane lurches every which way in the storm. She lifts it from the toolbox. Hides it in the camera bag, as suddenly the plane DROPS fifty feet, and Amelia is SLAMMED against the ceiling, then crashes back to the floor. Dazed, she sees Bill turned around... \nBILL \nHOLD ONTO SOMETHING FOR CHRISSAKE! She GRABS the leg of the navigation table which has been bolted down. Stares out the window, wondering if she'll make it. \nAMELIA (V.O.) Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know that.     I have no faith we'll meet anywhere again, but I wish we might. HOLD on the gray eyes.   DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia at the window, still opaque with fog. Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the clouds. There to the south, a FREIGHTER running across our path. No land in sight. \nA melia SCRAWLS a note, ties it to an ORANGE from her flight bag, and crawls back to the boys. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) \nHOW FAR TO LAND? The boys are studying the freighter. \nBILL \nRADIO'S   STILL OUT. NO WAY TO \nCOMPUTE   WINDSPEED AND DRIFT IN THE \nFOG, SO   GOD ONLY KNOWS WHERE \nIRELAND   IS. Checks his watch. \nBILL (CONT'D) \nNINETEEN HOURS PLUS. WE'VE GOT \nMAYBE AN HOUR OF PETROL LEFT. \nPROBABLY LESS. She shows him the note and the orange. \nAMELIA \nWESTERN UNION, SPECIAL DELIVERY. Bill has to smile. Are you serious? As a heart attack. Okay, he tries to get closer to the ship, but we're jerked and buffeted as we swing past and Amelia... ...DROPS the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy winds CARRY it two hundred yards WIDE of the mark. Our three stare grimly. \nAMELIA (CONT'D) \n", "test2_true": "RESCUE. Their eyes are locked. \nBILL \nTHINK THOSE RIDICULOUS SKIS COULD \nHOLD US UP IN THIS KIND OF SEA? She's been wondering the same. \nBILL (CONT'D) \nYOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT. \nARE YOU A LIAR? \nAMELIA \nNOT ON THIS OCCASION. A rare smile... \nBILL \nWELL, THEN. And SWOOPS back on course.   Amelia's hand squeezes his shoulder. DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia crouched behind Bill's seat.       Fog starting to break up. \nA \nHer face drawn, she almost seems to be holding her breath. Something down below. As we drop, we hear the engines \nA \nSPUTTER. \nMELIA \nWHEN'S THAT HOUR OF FUEL RUN OUT? \nBILL \nEIGHTEEN MINUTES AGO.   WHY? She glances over to Slim, who is busy unwrapping a sandwich. She can't believe this. He takes a healthy bite. \nAMELIA \nTHE LONGER I OBSERVE MEN THE MORE \nI AM AWESTRUCK. BY THEIR CAPACITY \nFOR DENIAL. She crawls back to the navigation table. As she looks out her window, a SANDWICH SAILS past! She WHIPS around...Slim's arms raised in jubilation. Down below... Land. \nEXT. SHORE, BURRY PORT, WALES - DAY \nThe little plane sputtering, shuddering, as Bill drops in for a splashdown. We PAN to the shore... ...a rural railroad dock. Deserted except for THREE WORKERS who glance up as the Friendship taxis to a buoy a few hundred yards offshore. Amelia at the hatch, tiny in distance, WAVES a towel... ...one friendly worker takes off his coat and WAVES back. Then all three guys go back to work. SNAP TO... REVERSE ANGLE. From the Friendship, we watch the workers ignoring us. Bill and Slim HOLLER and jump up and down on the pontoons. Nobody cares. Amelia sits in the doorway, her legs swinging free. \nAMELIA Out of gas. May have to swim for \nI t. LATER. Amelia alone. Six pages written by her side. Still working, as a rowboat pulls up. Bill stands in the bow. Calls to her... \nBILL Mr. Putnam phoned. He says there's fella coming from London. Hilton Railey. \nAMELIA Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More important than any of us. Really?    Yep. \nBILL He says ya mustn't come ashore til he gets here. No matter what. Great.    She doesn't like it, but there it is.   She waves, so long. \nBILL (CONT'D) Some kind of royalty, is he? She nods. \nAMELIA Public relations. Goes back to work.    DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her feet from the hatch. Alone. Hear the BUZZ of... ...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the water on its pontoons. She stares at it. Gathers up her things. LATER. Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring past him, vaguely apprehensive. REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand. The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia jumps out, the crowd... \n..begins to soberly APPLAUD, and slowly CLOSES IN around her. At first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand thrust toward her. She doesn't see that Bill and Slim have been shunted to the back. Suddenly... ...people get BOLDER. CLAPPING her on the back, reaching to TOUCH her, someone SNATCHES her scarf, she looks around frantically for Bill and Slim as... ...a SHERIFF and three DEPUTIES muscle their way to her using billy clubs to push people back. They surround Amelia, begin to escort her to the station... \nSHERIFF Sorry Ma'am. Shoulda brought more men. \nAMELIA No, really, this is very sweet, it's an honor. I'm actually enjoying it. \nSHERIFF That's a good thing. She looks at him as they are jostled along. \n", "test2_id": 2785, "test3_input": "AMELIA Feel like a drink? \nGEORGE Amelia!   What would her mother say? \nAMELIA Relax, George. I meant a Coke. As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others, the kid reacts. Oh, my. \nL ATER. Tea in the sitting room.    Elinor leaning forward, guileless, eager... \nELINOR They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit. \nGEORGE                          AMELIA On a bad week.                  On a good week. \nThe girl looks from one to the other. \nAMELIA All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real. \nELINOR Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling. It's why I'm here. \nGEORGE A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record, then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River. You don't seem to need much help selling yourself. \nELINOR Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her. Inadvertently, her eyes flick to the bedroom door. Catching this, our couple shares a dry smile. The kid sees that. Uh- oh. \nELINOR (CONT'D) What I mean is. It's a good thing. That's why I want it. Now our couple is trying not to laugh. \nGEORGE Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? ELINOR (straight back) To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot. The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically dumbstruck. \nAMELIA Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip? \nELINOR I do. \nAMELIA Keep doing what you're doing. The girl nods, seriously.    Okay. \nA \nMELIA (CONT'D) And don't let anyone turn you around. \nINT. PUTNAM HOUSE - CHRISTMAS DAY \nHoliday party in progress. Christmas decorations everywhere. A small crowd around the living room bar where George is telling a story. Now we see Dorothy standing, drinking, watching George with hard eyes. She turns on her heels and walks OUT into the garden. George sees this, excuses himself, follows her, as we PAN to... \n...Amelia standing with a group of guests.    She's seen it all. \nEXT. GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER \nHere she comes along the roses, still drinking, still fuming. A figure comes up behind her. Falls in step. \nGEORGE Lovely party, huh? \nDOROTHY Depends on your point of view. I've been listening to some idiot brag about his girlfriend. Still walking.   She never looks at him. \nGEORGE Well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind? \nDOROTHY It's not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket. It's just a pity we can't have one honest conversation about it. \nGEORGE What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department. She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our ANGLE we can now see D Amelia in the window, watching them. \nOROTHY If this is what you call an honest talk, I'd say you need some practice. \nGEORGE Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton. She stops walking.   Turns in shock, to see his easy smile. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Well, I'm waiting for our practice conversation. Hoping I'll learn something. About honesty. \nShe GLARES at him, and storms off. He lets her go. Hear a car engine TURN OVER. Dorothy PEELING OUT. George reflects. As he walks back toward the party, he now sees Amelia in the window. He stops. Their look holds. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT \nGeorge at the kitchen table in dim light. It's very late. A HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him. Followed by a slice of pie. A fork. He smiles. And softly... \nGEORGE Dorothy and I are through. She sits beside him.     Very close. \nAMELIA For a long, long time. \nGEORGE It's different now. She looks at him.   Squints.    How? \n", "test3_true": "AMELIA I can't do that. \nGEORGE If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me. He seems so sunny and strong.     What can he be feeling? \nAMELIA I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you. GEORGE (a murmur) Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse. \nS he comes close enough to kiss. \nAMELIA I know me.     And you don't.   Not really. \nGEORGE What if I promise not to learn? \nAMELIA The day will come. When I will run away. And when it does... He stops her with a kiss. \nGEORGE If you love me. I'll take my chances. He stares in her troubled eyes.   There is no answer. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Race you to bed. \nEXT. AIRFIELD - DAY - NEWSREEL \nAmelia and nearly 20 WOMEN lined up in front of planes. Waving, smiling, talking to each other. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely competitors say hello to the press announcing the First Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers `the Powder Puff Derby,' these gals certainly know how to capture our attention. The next ANGLE shows Amelia watching some of her colleagues bouncing playfully on a see-saw. She smiles tolerantly, but maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA, PUTNAM'S - DAY \nThe crowded waiting room. We CLOSE on a young woman we scarcely recognize. It is Elinor. Though less than a year has passed, she seems much older. Sophisticated, poised. ANGLE. A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to George's office. As they enter, George is pacing on the phone.              G EORGE (into phone) Because Amelia invented the Powder Puff Derby for female pilots. Then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the Rockies so they won't crash into the mountains! Listens, impatient. \nGEORGE (into phone) I'll tell you why it's a front page story. Because Amelia pulled every woman out of the race. So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. You want me to write your headline? He glances over.   Elinor in the doorway. GEORGE (into phone) Call you back. I've got a very important guest. He hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit.   As she does... \nELINOR Wish I was important enough for you to manage. \nGEORGE Well, I've just got one client. And most days she's more than I can manage. Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety. \nELINOR Get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the Derby. He grins back.   You bet. \nELINOR (CONT'D) Some of the gal flyers had their doubts about her...well, her skill level. But she's everyone's champion now. \nGEORGE And both of those things.      Are the S         reasons I called you. trange words.   He has her attention. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I think it would be huge for women flyers if Amelia won the Derby. The publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys. \nELINOR I'm not sure she has much of a chance, Mr. Putnam. \nGEORGE Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. We're thinking the Lockheed Vega. The girl's shock.    He really means this. \nELINOR Sir, I've test piloted the Vega. It's way more than she could ever handle. It wouldn't be safe, let alone successful. He smiles. \nGEORGE That's why I'm thinking of you flying with her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75 a week. Elinor WHISTLES low. \nELINOR Well, I think that's the most generous opportunity I've ever been offered. He stares at her. \nGEORGE There's just one thing. Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side. Her eyes narrow.    He's completely serious. \nELINOR In that case, I'll get my own plane and win the race myself. \nGEORGE You haven't changed. \nN o smile at all. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Unfortunately for you, neither have I. The look in his eye is not to be ignored. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You can't win if you can't get a plane to enter. Let me predict that you won't. The voice calm and low and riveting. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) In fact. If you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it. For a long, long time. \nELINOR That's a threat. \nGEORGE I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And this is what my loyalty requires. She's glaring.   Reeling.   Trapped. \nELINOR She's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around. \n", "test3_id": 2786}

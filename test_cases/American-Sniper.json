Some gave all. 1   OVER BLACK                                                  1 \nThe groan of tank treads drowns out THE CALL TO PRAYER as an entire MARINE COMPANY advances over the top of us. \n2   EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY                           2 \nThe sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street. MARINE COMPANY creeps toward us like a cautious Goliath. FOOT SOLDIERS walk alongside Humvees and tanks. \nCOMMANDING OFFICER (OS) (radio chatter) Charlie Bravo-3, we got eyes on you from the east. Clear to proceed, over. \n3   EXT. ROOFTOP, \"OVERWATCH\" - SAME                            3 \nSun glints off a slab of corrugated steel. Beneath it-- \nCHRIS KYLE lays prone, dick in the dirt, eye to the glass of a .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle. He's Texas stock with a boyish grin, blondish goatee and vital blue eyes. Both those eyes are open as he tracks the scene below, sweating his ass off in the shade of steel. \nCHRIS KYLE Fucking hot box. \nGOAT (24, Arkansas Marine) lies beside him, woodsy and outspoken, watching dirt-devils swirl in the street. \nGOAT Dirt over here tastes like dog shit. \nCHRIS KYLE I guess you'd know. \nGoat balks and fixes his M4 on the rooftop door. \nCHRIS SCOPE POV \nTRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction. We see him studying windage; we see what he's thinking-- \nSFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ escalates over picture as his concentration deepens. Cross-hairs land on-- \nA MAN ON CELL PHONE watches the convoy from a rooftop. \nCHRIS KYLE (keys mike) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over. \nCOMMANDING OFFICER (OS) If you think he's reporting troop movement you have a green-light. Your call. Over. \nGOAT (OC) He could be calling his old lady. \nMAN ON CELL studies the convoy, his hair tossed by wind. CROSS-HAIR push left of target, compensating for windage. \nSFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, holds it, then expels. \nHis finger is taking up trigger-slack when the man dips his shoulder slightly. Chris holds off as-- \nMAN ON CELL hangs up and steps away. \nCHRIS KYLE (keys mike) He stepped off. \nChris sucks air. Close. The ambient world floods back in. Barked orders, diesel engines and-- \nA WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street. \nCHRIS KYLE (keys mike) Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving toward the convoy. \n(ECU)-- The woman cradles something beneath her robes. \nCHRIS KYLE Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something. \nCROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object from her robes. His vision obscured but-- \nCHRIS KYLE She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid. \nCOMMANDING OFFICER (OS) --you say a woman and kid? \nSFX: his heart-beat, THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP. \nCHRIS KYLE You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? \nCOMMANDING OFFICER (OS) Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call. \nGOAT (OC) They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth. \nTHE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade. \nCHRIS KYLE (OC) Fuck-- \nMOTHER motions the Kid to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her son's footsteps; all blowing the same direction. \nTHE KID sprints toward the Marines. \nIN THE STREET \nYOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt. \nCLOSE ON CHRIS \nWAYNE KYLE Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf-- \nDEBBY Wayne-- \nWAYNE But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it. \nCHRIS The guy was picking on Jeff. \nWAYNE KYLE That true? \nJEFF (eye swollen) Yes sir... Yes, he was... \nWAYNE KYLE (turns to Chris) And did you finish it? \nChris shows the swollen knuckles of his hand, and nods. \nWAYNE Then you know who you are... \n13   EXT. BARN                                                   13 \nA GROWN MAN(CHRIS) exits the barn into the light of day. Behind him, horns of dozens of bucks cover the wall. \nWAYNE (VO) You know your purpose. \nThe barn door closes leaving us in brindled darkness. \n\"AMERICAN SNIPER\" \n14   EXT. RODEO ARENA                                            14 \nA hand grips the tie on a bronc. CHRIS sits bareback atop the horse, its nostrils steaming, eyes shock wide. (ECU)-- a hair-line crack along its right front hoof. \nBUZZER SOUNDS. GATE OPENS. The bronco leaps out. Empty stands blur past. The Bronc and Chris united in a futile struggle. He leans right, the bronc circles right, staying off that bad hoof. Chris makes the buzzer but-- \nHe gets tossed on dismount. The bronco stomps his hand. He scrambles out of the ring as RODEO CLOWNS distract it. \nFIND JEFF(19) ringside, with tight lips and severe eyes. He looks over the empty arena, laughing. \n15   INT. FORD TRUCK                                             15 \nHeadlights rattle over a dirt road. JEFF drives. CHRIS rides, BAG OF ICE on hand, BELT BUCKLE prize on the dash. He stares into the field where A WILD HORSE, races alongside them, a spectral image in the darkness. \nJEFF Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. What you supposed to do with it? \nCHRIS (grabs belt buckle) You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood. \nJEFF A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood. \nCHRIS Is that what they say? \nJEFF You know what they called her in high school-- \nCHRIS Don't say it. \nJEFF Sarah suck-a-- \nChris swings his bag of ice, smacks Jeff in the face. \nJEFF Shit man-- \nHe swerves off the road. The truck almost coming apart before he ramps back up, coming to a dusty halt outside-- \n16   EXT. BUNKHOUSE                                              16 \nSpanish moss hangs over a shackle-board residence. Chris tumbles out the truck, clips on the belt buckle and-- \n17   INT. BUNKHOUSE                                              17 \nCHRIS swaggers into the narrow bunkhouse. A sheet hangs in back, separating sleeping area from living area. \nCHRIS Who wants to hump a rodeo star? \nMovement back there. A MAN ASS suddenly protrudes from the curtain as a BURLY COWBOY-TYPE climbs into jeans. \nCHRIS What the fuck-- \nSARAH steps out, his high school sweetheart all grown up. \nSARAH You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow. \nCHRIS (wounded) Why would you do this? \nCowboy leaves his shirt open flaunting a big hairy chest. \nSARAH Just let him out. He didn't know... \nCHRIS (shamed, steps aside) You didn't know? \nCowboy doesn't answer. Chris SLAMS HIS HEAD into the refrigerator and ramps him out the front door. \nSARAH What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend! \nCHRIS Get out. \nShe jumps at the chance-- ripping clothes out of closets. \nSARAH You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? You're no cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay! \nCHRIS No, sir. \nINSTRUCTOR ROLLE Was that your ass talking then? \nTHE BELL RINGS. Chris jerks up, worried it was Biggles but-- an ATHLETIC CANDIDATE staggers off. \nINSTRUCTOR ROLLE That's a quitter. If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. When shit gets hairy he can't step up. You get shot, he can't pull you out. We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two. \nChris and Biggles share a look, a vow, as-- \nINSTRUCTOR ROLLE Wave goodbye to the sun, boys... \n23   OMITTED                                                     23 \n24   EXT. BEACH - \"SNAKE PIT\" - NIGHT                            24 \nA bonfire crackles atop a sand dune. CANDIDATES crouch in a pit they dug, hugging oars, shivering with hypothermia. CHRIS stands over the ditch, trying to make INSTRUCTORS laugh to earn a place by the fire beside BIGGLES. \nCHRIS --and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- (guys start laughing) So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, \"it stings, it stings\" but when I'd stop, she'd scream \"no don't stop\" and it's fizzing out and-- \nINSTRUCTORS in stitches. Fire flickering off Chris' face. \n25   EXT. \"MUD FLATS\" - DAY                                      25 \nFog shrouds CANDIDATES COVERED IN MUD, seated belly-to- back, chattering and quaking, hypothermic. \n\"INSTRUCTOR TONY\"(34), a salty cholo, walks their line. \nINSTRUCTOR \"TONY\" You really from Connecticut, Dauber? I never met a hick from Hartford. \n\"DAUBER\" is 6'4\" and 240 with a flop of yellow hair like the character from Coach. A sleepy Connecticut cowboy. \nDAUBER Country is countrywide, sir. \nINSTRUCTOR \"TONY\" I don't think he likes black dudes, \"D\". \n\"D\" is African American, from Indiana, stoic and stacked. He has a rhythmic grumble and a meat-eater's glare. \n\"D\" That's alright, sir. I'm not black. \nINSTRUCTOR \"TONY\" No? \n\"D\" No, I'm new black. We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. We make white folk proud then hose their ladies. \n\"BIGGLES\" still giggles, but he's looking fit as they chip away everything that isn't a Navy Seal. \nINSTRUCTOR \"TONY\" You hungry Biggles? I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck. \nBIGGLES Hooyah. I'd toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on. \n\"SQUIRREL\" is a San Clemente surfer kid, just tall enough to ride roller-coaster, with a jutty jaw. \nINSTRUCTOR \"TONY\" (screams in his face) Squirrel! Where'd you hide your nuts? \nSQUIRREL Nuts crawled up inside. The little shits are gone for good. \n\"CHRIS\" sits up front, covered in mud. His eyes burn steely blue, full of resolve. He's found himself here. \nINSTRUCTOR \"TONY\" How about you old man? How you feeling? \nCHRIS KYLE Dangerous, sir. Feeling dangerous. \nThe boys send up a spirited \"HOOYAH\" and-- TONY looks them over with some small measure of approval. \n26   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                         26 \nThe INSTRUCTOR CADRE watches 32 CANDIDATES SWARM each other, howling and dog-piling at the end of hell-week. \n27   OMITTED                                                     27 \n28   OMITTED                                                     28 \n29   INT. MULONEY'S BAR - NIGHT                                  29 \nA crowd watches the boys toss darts at a bulls-eye drawn on DAUBER'S naked back. At the bar, BIGGLES and CHRIS-- \nCHRIS I'm gonna try and get into sniper school. \nBIGGLES Can you shoot? \nCHRIS I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper? \nBIGGLES Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way cooler. \nA brunette steps to the bar. A sharp object with heavy eye-shadow and tight leather pants. This girl owns her sexuality but she's often been used for it. \nThis is \"TAYA\". She is trying to ignore the advances of A SHORT NAVY GUY but he's relentless. Chris watches as (ECU)-- Taya's fingertips whiten, gripping her glass. \nChris edges closer, she looks up, defensive-- but he just stands there, letting his protective presence be felt. \nDAPPER NAVY GUY (OC) Come on, just let me buy you a drink. \nTAYA (end of her rope) Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married? \nDAPPER NAVY GUY I'm not-- \nTAYA I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home. \nChris exhales, pauses, strokes-- BAM! \n32   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE                                        32 \nA ZOLOFT BROCHURE shows smiling faces. TAYA wears a suit- skirt and tries to mimic the esprit of the brochure. She leaves a box of samples with the RECEPTIONIST but her smile fades as she pulls her trolley to the door-- \n33   INT. TAYA'S CONDO - DAY                                     33 \nBlades of light leak through closed blinds. Taya hides under blankets on the sofa. PHONE RINGS, goes to message: \nCHRIS (OS) It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- \nShe snatches up the phone-- \nTAYA You figured what? \n--looking for a reason not to be alone. \n34   EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY                      34 \nON CHRIS, both eyes open looking downrange. \nPO TOSH (OC) Aim small, miss small. If you aim for his shirt button, you might miss by two inches. If you aim for his shirt, you miss by two feet. (over Chris, raises binocs) You better close those groupings, Kyle. \nChris chases his breath, trying to focus, but-- \n35   EXT. OCEANSIDE PIER - DUSK                                35 \nPAN ACROSS a \"target shoot\" game to a bench overlooking surf. CHRIS and TAYA sit with a GIANT TEDDY BEAR. \nTAYA Did you always want to be a soldier? \nCHRIS I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more. \nTAYA So you started rescuing girls from bars? \nCHRIS I rescued that bar from you. \nShe smiles at his sweetness. \nCHRIS Do you like country music? \nTAYA Only when I'm depressed. \nCHRIS You want kids? \nTAYA Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men. \nCHRIS That's a shitty thing to tell a girl. \nTAYA I've proven her right. \nCHRIS But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are. \nThe Ferris wheel casts its glow on them. \nTAYA What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun? \nCHRIS (uncertain) I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes. \nIt weighs on him. And she feels safe. \nBACK TO: \n35A   EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN                            35A \nPO TOSH (on spotting scope) stands over CHRIS. Mirage boils off the horizon at 35 degree angle, pushed by wind. BAM! Chris' shot hits the outer edge of target. \nPO TOSH Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle. \nCHRIS Check. I'm dialed for windage. \nPO TOSH Hold right-four, up-two. \nBAM! He misses. It spits dirt. Not even close. \nPO TOSH Are we looking at the same target? \n36    INT. TAYA'S CONDO - NIGHT                                   36 \nCHRIS sits on the couch, anxious, until TAYA appears in the hall in lingerie. She slinks closer, straddling him, determined to blow his mind but-- \nCHRIS You're trembling... \nTAYA I know. I don't... \nShe finds his eyes. Finds her breath. \nCHRIS We don't have to do this... \nTAYA I want to. I do... \nHe gently lifts her up and lays her across the couch. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSoft light on pale bodies. Taya writhes with impatient longing but Chris' steady hand forces her into the present. She's swept up, eyes filling with tears as he eases into her-- she gasps and arcs and draws him deeper. \nON DANCE FLOOR \nTaya sees the nod from Biggles to Chris, we're going. She tenses up in his arms, her feet growing heavy. \nCHRIS They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. \nTAYA I'm so afraid. \nCHRIS Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan. \nHe pulls her close, HIS EYES FIXED on someone else-- \nTAYA Your heart is beating out of your chest. \nCHRIS (nods, looking past her) I'm not the only one going to war. \nJEFF KYLE stands on the rail in MARINE DRESS UNIFORM. \nCAKE CUTTING - EVENING \nThe boat rocks on choppy water. Taya dabs cake on Chris's nose and they kiss. THE BOOM of distant fireworks is followed by AIR-RAID SIRENS as shock & awe hit Baghdad. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nCHYRON: \"OPERATION PHANTOM FURY: 2nd BATTLE OF FALLUJAH\" \nMARC LEE (PRE-LAP) Welcome to Fallujah. The new wild west of the old middle east. \n44   INT. M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER, FALLUJAH - DAY        44 \nSOLDIERS sit elbow to elbow. 6 SEAL SNIPERS and A SQUAD OF MARINES to watch their backs. CHRIS tucks the little blue Bible and American flag and into his webbing then removes his wedding band, hanging it from his necklace. \nMARC LEE AO2 (26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and handsome. He glows like a halo in a river full of shit. \nMARC LEE AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it. \nThe rig hits a pothole and faces clench expecting an IED. \nMARC LEE You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do \"overwatch\" for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. \nThe truck battles to a stop. \nMARC LEE The city was evacuated. Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home. Move-- \nThe hatch falls open-- \n45   EXT. HOSPITAL, NORTHERN BRIDGE, FALLUJAH                    45 \nA gunmetal sky. The staccato pop of GUNFIRE in the distance. SNIPERS and SUPPORT cross an orchard. \nCHRIS walks upright. The Marine paired with Chris is a mouthy Arkansas boy, \"WINSTON\", skitters tree to tree. \nWINSTON Keep your head down, Tex. The Muj' got snipers too. \nCHRIS A sniper won't aim for your head. \nA DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex. \nWINSTON They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out-- \n46    INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX                                      46 \nAn open atrium eight stories tall. CHRIS and WINSTON walk past a giant pile of furniture and debris tossed down. \nWINSTON (CONT'D) --they call him \"Mustafa.\" He was in the Olympics. \nCHRIS They got sniping in the Olympics now? \nThey start up the stairs. \n46A   OMITTED                                                    46A \n47    INT.

Chris pulls a Springfield .45 as-- \nA GOAT \nBounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors. \nRAILING \nCHRIS and WINSTON look down to the lobby, where Marines stand around the DEAD GOAT. \nCHRIS (laughing) You just got your first kill, Goat. \nHe nudges Chris, trying to get a celebration out of him-- \nCHRIS Get the fuck off me. \nThis is the reality of war. Not like he anticipated. \nCLOSE ON CHRIS \nBreath racing. Bleeding sweat. Trying to process his disgust. Trying to inject some purpose, mumbling: Protect the Marines. Protect the Marines. Protect... \nClouds crawl over Chris like ghosts, swirling feverishly as HOURS SLIDE BY. His face takes on a preternatural blankness as he begins to slip into the shadows of self. \nSuddenly-- clouds halt, pupils flare, chest inflates. \n49   EXT. ELIZABETH STREET - SAME                                49 \nSun flares as MARC LEE advances alongside 1ST PLATOON MARINES (40 men) when-- A SHOT SOUNDS. A BODY TUMBLES out of the sky and lands in their midst with a meaty thud. \n1ST MARINE #1 -Fuck, man! What the hell-- \nThe Marines duck for cover then look to the sky-- \n1ST MARINE #2 -Where'd it come from? \nMARC LEE That's your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. Keep moving. \nMarines slowly return to standing, glancing up at surrounding structures trying to spot their protector. \n50   INT. WINDOW - LATE AFTERNOON                                50 \nChris lays atop a baby crib. A scrim hangs in front of him. Sunlight burns through it, casting a thousand pinpricks of light across his face. SUN MARCHES ACROSS the sky and pixels twist over his cataleptic shape. \nSuddenly-- sun halts, chest inflates, eyes flare. \n51   INT. STREET - SAME                                           51 \nA CAR SPEEDS toward 1ST PLATOON. MARINES open fire with the feeble POP-POP of M4s. The car still coming-- \nA SNIPER SHOT BOOMS across the sky like thunder. The windshield spiders, blood splattered, and the car stops. \nAs Marines search rooftops for him-- THE CAR EXPLODES. \n52   INT. LOOTED ROOM, ELIZABETH STREET - EVENING                 52 \nCHRIS plants a loop-hole charge at the base of the wall and steps around the corner to trigger the charge. \nCUT BETWEEN: \nINT.

ELIZABETH STREET - NIGHT                                53 \nA palm tree burns like a candle over Fallujah.

(knocks on next gate) Derka, derka, derka.... \nMARINE VIPERS laugh, bowling into a courtyard. \nCHRIS SCOPE POV (N/V) \nGlowing green hue. CROSS-HAIRS track the Marines entry, sweep the street and push toward the rooftop, when-- \nA SHOT SOUNDS. A MARINE FALLS in a 2nd story window. \nMARINE VIPER #4 (OS) (over radio) --Fuck! Man down! It came through the window-- \nCROSS-HAIRS whip across rooftops, on a swivel. \nCHRIS (OC) That was sniper fire. Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. Over. \nMARINE VIPER CO (OS) Negative.

One of the Marines looks like Jeff Kyle. \nCHRIS (keys mike) Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target. \n\"Jeff Marine\" sets a charge, turns-- not Jeff. \nThe door blows off. Marines rush in. GUNFIRE POPS. Marines rush back out, dragging a WOUNDED MARINE. \nCHRIS Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. You coming? \nGOAT No man. No. I like my life. I wanna make it home. I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit. It's not my job to knock down doors. Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I ain't doing that shit. \nCHRIS (smiles) If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again. \n61   INT.

Chris glances that direction. \nCHRIS Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to hear that. \nMADS You should come down to the VA sometime. The guys would love it.

I wouldn't be here without him. \nMads stands and comes to attention, saluting Chris. \nMADS My family thanks you for your service. \nChris bites back emotion, nods, and walks out. \n100   INT.

Even when you're here you're not here. \nTaya pulls McKenna off her breast. Chris scoops her up. \nTAYA I hate the teams for it. I do. You're my husband and the father of my children-- but they're the ones that pull you back. \nCHRIS (doesn't look up from his daughter) We can wait.

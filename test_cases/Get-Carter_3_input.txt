CARTER You bitch! It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it? 
He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans out, his usual cheery self. 
CON Peter's very upset about his car. He's going to shit all over you. 
CARTER I'll catch up with you later, Margaret. 
And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar. 
PETER (shouts above the revs) Come on, get in. 
Con does and they race off. 
EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 
Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown steps leading down to the river road, where his car is parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off. 
EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY 
Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind. He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see his parked car. 
As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car. 
A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him just before the Jaguar and slows down. 
GLENDA Over here, Jack. 
Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off. 
The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre. 
Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill. 
INT. SUNBEAM - DAY 
Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take his eyes off her. 
GLENDA You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? 
CARTER No. I didn't know that. 
GLENDA A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky? 
CARTER So where are we going, Princess? 
GLENDA To the demon king's castle, of course. 
CARTER Of course. Where else? 
The car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark. 
INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY 
Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around each deserted floor. 
CARTER How'd you know where I'd be? 
GLENDA You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited. 
CARTER Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk! 
GLENDA Nasty. 
CARTER He must have been pretty sure I'd come.

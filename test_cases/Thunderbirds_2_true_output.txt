LADY PENELOPE Come in. 
Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is up to her shoulders in bubble bath. 
LADY PENELOPE Have a look at this, Parker. (There is a computer monitor near her feet.) He, and this 
woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood. 
PARKER Sounds like an alias, milady. 
LADY PENELOPE Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when 
his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. (takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker. 
The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. Belagant's brother. 
PARKER Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano. 
LADY PENELOPE How's my schedule, Parker? 
PARKER You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the 
Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore. 
LADY PENELOPE I suppose that's urgent. 
PARKER Yes, milady. There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in 
Jakarta. 
LADY PENELOPE The Thunderbirds haven't responded? 
PARKER No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis-Ã -vis their whereabouts. Parker turns on 
the news. 
CHUCK Over to Lisa Lowe. 
LISA LOWE Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds. 
Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a 
volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible machines 
LADY PENELOPE I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker. 
PARKER I fear you're not wrong, milady. 
LISA LOWE Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck. 
Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins to blink and beep. Back on Tracy 
Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is unable to get up to get to it because he is 
tied up. 
Scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle. 
ALAN I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.

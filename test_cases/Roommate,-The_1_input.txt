INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Irene opens the door and Sara walks in. 
IRENE What took you so long? 
SARA I walked. 
IRENE You didn't! 
SARA It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a student. 
IRENE Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines. 
SARA Duh? 
IRENE Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked. 
SARA What?! 
IRENE Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She answers. 
SARA Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene. 
SARA 
(TO IRENE) Do you like cats? 
IRENE Yeah, why? 
SARA We have to get rid of one. 
IRENE Can't. Travel too much. Poor thing would starve to death. 
SARA You're right. (back into phone) No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't know... whenever I get there. Bye. 
IRENE Who was that? 
SARA My roommate. More than a little overprotective. 
IRENE That's no fun. 
SARA So, where is it? 
IRENE What? 
SARA You said you had a surprise for me? 
IRENE Oh yeah. I went through my closet. There's nothing here I've worn in the past six months. Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes. 
SARA You're kidding, all of these?! Oh no. 
IRENE What ...what? 
SARA We have no closet space at the dorms. Rebecca's already using half of mine. 
IRENE Oh my God, I just had the best idea. 
SARA What? 
IRENE Why don't you move in here with me? 
SARA Seriously? 
IRENE Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets. 
SARA Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about it.

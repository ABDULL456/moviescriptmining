NOISES of Enterprise bridge, clicking of relays, minor electronic effects. We HEAR A FEMALE VOICE. \nSAAVIK'S VOICE Captain's log. Stardate 8130.3, Starship Enterprise on training mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14, coordinates 22/87/4. Approaching Neutral Zone, all systems functioning. \nINT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE \nAs the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations; (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con- sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan. In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless facial immobility of a Vulcan. \nSULU Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen. \nSAAVIK Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone. \nSULU Aye, Captain. \nUHURA (suddenly) Captain... I'm getting something on the distress channel. Minimal signal... But something... \nSAAVIK Can you amplify? \nUHURA I'm trying... \nSULU Course change projected. \nUHURA It's an emergency distress call! \nSAAVIK On speakers! \nVOICE (filtered, breaking up) Imperative! Imperative! This is the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen periods out of Altair Six. We have struck a gravitic mine and have lost all power... Our hull is... (breaks up, static) ... and many casualties. \nUHURA This is the Starship Enterprise. Your message is breaking up. Give your coordinates. Repeat -- \nVOICE Enterprise, our position is Gamma Hydra, Section Ten... \nSAAVIK In the neutral zone. \nVOICE Hull penetrated, life support systems failing. Can you assist us, Enterprise? Can you... \nBreaks up. \nSAAVIK Data on Kobayashi Maru! Tactical! \nTactical on big screen. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Subject vessel is third class neutronic fuel carrier, crew of eighty-one, three hundred passengers. \nSAAVIK Damn. (then) Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course. \nSULU May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone -- \nSAAVIK I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister. \nSULU (with a nod) ... Now entering the Neutral Zone... \n2   OMITTED                                                      2 \n3   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ANOTHER ANGLE                       3 \nCOMPUTER VOICE Warning. We have entered the Neutral Zone... Warning... \nSULU Estimating two minutes to intercept. \nOn screen: Enterprise approaches the stricken vessel. \nSAAVIK Stand by transporter room, ready to beam survivors, aboard. \nUHURA Captain, I've lost their signal! \nCOMPUTER VOICE Alert. Sensors indicate three Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316, mark 4, closing fast. \nSAAVIK Visual! \nOn screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels, they are dark and sinister. \nThe door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper. \nKIRK (continuing) Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods? \nBONES 'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday... \nWith a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue liquid. \nKIRK Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal -- \nBONES (broad) I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring... \nKIRK (reading the label with difficulty) Twenty-two, eighty-three... \nBONES Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme. \nHe takes the bottle and pours; continues talking. \nBONES (continuing) Now open the other one. \nKirk starts to obey. \nKIRK I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon -- \nBONES More antiques for your collection -- Cheers! \nThey drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold \"Ben Franklin\" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.) \nKIRK Cheers. Bones, these are... charming. \nBONES Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact. \nKIRK Uh -- what are they? \nBONES For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens. \nKIRK But I'm allergic to Retlax. \nBONES Exactly. Happy birthday. \nHe toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work. \nBONES (continuing) Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom. \nKIRK (reacts) Amazing! I don't know what to say -- \nBONES Say thank you. \nKIRK Thank you. \nAn awkward silence. \nBONES Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral? \nKIRK Bones, I don't want to be lectured. \nBONES What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies. \nKIRK Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and... \nBONES Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations -- \nKIRK And who am I hiding from? \nBONES From yourself, Admiral. \nPause. Kirk pours another drink. \nKIRK Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think. \nBONES (mild take) I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection. \nThey look at each other. \n12   EXT.

SURFACE CETI ALPHA V                                   14 \nA YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES, filtered, are hard to make out. \nCHEKOV Captain, we've got to get out of here -- now! Damn! Hurry! \nTerrell catches his urgency -- \nTERRELL But the child -- \nCHEKOV Never mind! Hurry! \n22   EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY                                      22 \nTerrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead. \n23   ANGLE - THEIR POV                                           23 \nA RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded. \n24   INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE                                   24 \nMr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti Alpha V on the forward screen. \nBEACH Try again. \nKYLE Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell ... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will you please respond, Captain... Captain Terrell, respond please. \nNothing. \nBEACH (thinks) Let's give them a little more time. \n25   INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V                              25 \nTerrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN. \nThey seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM. \nOut of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri- fied. The mask is peeled back. \nCHEKOV (aloud despite himself) Khan! \nKHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and examines Chekov and Terrell. \nKHAN (finally) I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it? (wonderingly) I never thought to see your face again. \nTERRELL Chekov, who is this man? \nCHEKOV A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering -- \nTERRELL What do you want with us? I demand -- \nKHAN (mild) You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk. \nTERRELL Listen to me -- you men and women -- \nKHAN Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he... (i.e. Chekov) ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze? \nTERRELL I've never even met Admiral Kirk -- \nKHAN Admiral? He didn't tell you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us? \nCHEKOV You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to -- \nKHAN This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails. \nCHEKOV Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him. \nKHAN (moves closer) And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how Admiral Kirk requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth! \nThe wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his eyes are filled with tears. \nKHAN (continuing) A plague upon you all. \nHe recovers his poise and returns to them -- \nKHAN (continuing) You didn't expect to find me. You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI. Why are you here? \nThey don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -- \nKHAN (continuing) Why? \nTerrell gasps, stays silent -- \nKHAN (continuing) No matter. \nHe lets go; Terrell falls with a thud -- \nKHAN (continuing) You will soon tell me willingly enough. \nKIRK Permission to come aboard, Captain? \nSPOCK Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. \nKIRK (dryly to Saavik) Yes, we've been through death and life together. \nSaavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte. \nKIRK (continuing to Scotty) Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well? \nSCOTTY I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through. \nKIRK Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott? \nUncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones -- \nBONES Shore leave, Admiral. \nKIRK Ah. \nHe stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand- ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an engineer's uniform. \nKIRK (continuing) And who is this? \nPRESTON (breathless) Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR. \nA big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute. \nKIRK Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston? \nPRESTON Yes, SIR. \nKIRK I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room? \nHe moves, followed by his staff. \nSCOTTY (eyeing his prot\u0082g\u0082) I believe you'll find all in order -- \nSPOCK We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral. \nKIRK Very good, Mr. Spock. \nKirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND SAAVIK. \nSAAVIK He's not what I expected, Sir. \nSPOCK What did you expect, Lieutenant? \nSAAVIK (uncertain) He's very human. \nSPOCK We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical. \nSaavik is humbled. \nSAAVIK As always, my mentor. Company dismiss. \n33   INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM - LOOKING DOWN                  33 \nThe inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc. Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention. \n34   ANGLE - FLOOR OF ENGINE ROOM                                34 \nFEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train- ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston. \nPRESTON (blurting) I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral. \nKIRK (sternly puts him on) Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap? \nPRESTON (scandalized) Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star -- \nThe repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused. \nPRESTON (continuing) If the Admiral can't see the facts for himself, then, with all due respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion bat. SIR. \nApproving laughter. Kirk looks amused. \nKIRK Midshipman, you're a tiger. \nSCOTTY My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space. \nKIRK Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. (brisk) Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise? \nSCOTTY Give the word, Admiral. \nKIRK Mr. Scott, the word is given. \nSULU We are clear and free to navigate. \nSAAVIK Course heading, Captain? \nSpock turns inquiringly to Kirk. \nKIRK Captain's discretion. \nSpock digests this with a slight smile. \nSPOCK Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose. \n43   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE (STOCK FROM FEATURE)                    43 \nShe gathers speed into the vastness of space. \n44   EXT. SPACE, FEATURING THE RELIANT                    44 \nmoving towards us, in opposition to the previous shot, close enough for us to read her markings. \n45   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                         45 \nKhan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol- lowers in their odd-looking clothes. \nAt the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console. Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation, symptoms of their mind-controlled state. \nJOACHIM Steady on course. All systems normal. \nKHAN It's not much different from Enterprise. (beat) When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ? \nCHEKOV Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information. \nKHAN Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information? \nCHEKOV I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff. \nKHAN Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis? \nCHEKOV To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I. \nKHAN (thinks) I see. Helmsman? \nHELMSMAN Aye, sir. \nJOACHIM May I speak? We're all with you, sir, but consider: we are free, we have a ship and the means to go where we will. We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V. You have proved your superior intellect and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk. You do not need to defeat him again. \nKHAN He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before I give him up. (as no one speaks) Prepare to alter course -- for Space Station Regula I. \n46   EXT. SPACE - SPACE STAION REGULA I                          46 \n47   INT. CAROL'S LAB                                            47 \nHuge and busy. Among the scientists going about their tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense; MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer console. \nDAVID Does that about do it? \nCAROL I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one. \nDAVID Who -- \nJedda at the Comm Console overlaps. \nJEDDA Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel ... It's Reliant. \nCarol moves forward as the others close in. \nCAROL On the screen, please, Jedda. \nButtons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV. \nCHEKOV ... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant -- \nCAROL Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead. \nCHEKOV Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days. \nCAROL En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? (pause) Has something happened? Do you read us? \nCHEKOV (fractional pause) All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out. \nPleased reaction from the scientists. \nCAROL I still don't under -- \nCHEKOV We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI. \nSPOCK Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. \nKIRK That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I. \nSPOCK Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command. \nKIRK But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you... \nSPOCK You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise. \nKirk smiles in bemused wonderment. \nKIRK You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions. \nSPOCK I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. (pause) Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. \nKIRK I would not presume to debate you. \nSPOCK That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. \nKIRK Or the one. \nSpock inclines his head. \nSPOCK You are my superior officer. You are also my friend. I have been and always shall be yours. \nKirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally: \nKIRK Will you accompany me to the bridge? \nSPOCK I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets. \nKirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice. \n58   EXT. SPACE STATION REGULA I                                 58 \nFloating quietly around the planet below. Tranquil as we PUSH SLOWLY IN. \nOVER we can hear, FILTERED, UHURA'S VOICE: \nUHURA'S VOICE Regula I, this is Enterprise. This is Enterprise calling. Do you receive... I say... \n59   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      59 \nFeaturing Spock and Uhura, as she keeps trying -- \nUHURA ... Again, this is Enterprise calling Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please. Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please -- it's no use; no response from Regula I. \nSPOCK But no longer jammed? \nUHURA No, sir. No nothing. \nSpock considers, moves to Kirk. \nSPOCK There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond. \nKIRK How far? \nSPOCK Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed. \nKIRK Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom? \nSPOCK It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was. \nKirk looks at him, nods; rising now. \nKIRK Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the con. \nThey start for the Turbo Lifts as Saavik reacts -- \n60   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                        60 \nBONES I've got the sick bay ready.

Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Identify for retina scan. \nKIRK Kirk, Admiral James T., Starfleet General Staff. Security Class 1. \nThe screen is suddenly busy with coded read-outs and then computer graphics of retina patterns. Then it glows green. SECURITY CLEARANCE, CLASS 1 GRANTED. \nKIRK (continuing) Summary, please. \nMore coded read-outs, a red line SECURITY SCAN, then over it APPROVED, in green.

On Khan's screen, the Enterprise grows larger -- \nKHAN (almost sing-song with joy) Slow to one-half impulse power. Let's be friends... \nHELMSMAN Slowing to one-half impulse. \nJOACHIM They're requesting visual communications, sir. \nKHAN Let them eat static. \nJOACHIM They're still running with shields down. \nKHAN Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold? (pause) It is very cold in space. \n72   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      72 \nSULU Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing -- \nKIRK Visual. \nVisual of Reliant appears. \nSAAVIK Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est -- \nSPOCK Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations. \nSAAVIK Aye, sir. \nKIRK (watches the screen) This is damned peculiar.

(a pause) He wishes to discuss terms of our surrender. \nThere is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's. \nKIRK On screen. \nUHURA (hesitating) Admiral -- \nKIRK Do it, while we have time. \nAll eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling -- \nKIRK (continuing; dumbfounded) Khan! \nSAAVIK Who? \nKHAN You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you. \nKIRK What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant? \nKHAN Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life -- \n88   EXT.

All I ask is that you spare my crew. \nKHAN That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think. \n90   EXT.

Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry... \nSAAVIK Reliant's command... \nKIRK HURRY. \nSPOCK The prefix code? \nKIRK It's all we've got. \nKHAN No! \nJOACHIM Sir, we must! (desperate urging) We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere. \nKhan calms as the other holds him; he breathes deeper. \n101   EXT.

I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been -- \nThe turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them. Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face; he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as the others rush forward. \n103   EXT.

Kirk enters and LEADS CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees Scotty and Kirk. \nPRESTON (faint) Is the word given? \nKIRK (soft) The word is given: warp speed. \nPRESTON (almost smiles) Aye... \nHe dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk. \nSCOTTY WHY? \nKIRK (looks at Preston) He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance. \nBONES Scotty, I'm sorry... \nSCOTTY He stayed at his post. When the trainees ran, he stayed. \nKIRK If he hadn't, we'd be space by now. \nSPOCK'S VOICE Admiral, this is Spock. \nKirk hits a wall intercom -- \nKIRK Yes, Spock. \nSPOCK'S VOICE Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power. \nKIRK (thinks) Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line? \nSCOTTY I dinna think so, sir, but you'll have my best -- \nWith an effort, he gets to his feet -- \nSCOTTY (continuing) Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor... \nSqueezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR the sound of impulse power taking effect. \nKIRK Are you all right? \nBones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston. \nBONES Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis? \nKIRK At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe... \nBONES There may still be time... you gave as good as you got. \nFor a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like being in a haunted house. \nKIRK Hello...! Anybody here? \nA WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries. \nSAAVIK (raises tricorder) Indeterminate life signs. \nKIRK Phasers on stun. Move out. \nThey separate. Each begins to search. \n114   ANGLE WITH SAAVIK                                          114 \nShe moves to the electronic and data area, examines the consoles, the equipment, then settles for the data bank.

Bones reacts with brave apprehension. \nRounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in front of him. \nBones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think he's safe. \nSUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside down human ARM. \n116   SAME LOCALE - LATER                                        116 \nKirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES from where they were hanged, upside down. \nHaving recovered his composure, Bones examines the corpses. We RECOGNIZE Madison, March, among others. \nOne is clearly the COOK. \nKIRK (stunned) They even killed the galley chief. \nBONES This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim. \nKirk looks around, despairingly -- \nKIRK Carol... \n117   INT.

As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously. Be this a room, a locker of some other place, this time they -- \"open the door.\" The limp bodies of Chekov and Terrell fall out. \nUHURA'S VOICE (on screen) Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in, please. Come in please. \nShe will continue sporadically. \nKIRK My God! \nChekov emits a live, reassuring moan. \nBONES That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've served with him. \nBones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov. \nBONES (continuing) Brain disturbance. Appears to be drug induced. \nHe reaches into his kit. He shoots Chekov moves off to Terrell. Uhura, voice continues in the b.g. \nKIRK Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right. \n119   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FAVORING UHURA                    119 \nUHURA I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal.

SPACE STATION - TIGHT GROUP                           120 \nChekov opens his eyes, and stares into Kirk's. \nCHEKOV Oh, God, Admiral...! \nKIRK Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range. \nUHURA'S VOICE Sir -- we won't leave you behind...! \nKIRK Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. (to Terrell and Chekov) You gentleman can remain here, or... \nTERRELL If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd like to share the risk. \nKIRK (hesitates) Very well. Let's go. \nBONES Go? Where are we going? \nKIRK (points to console) Where they went. Saavik. \nKirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console, rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk. \nBONES But what if they went -- nowhere? \nKIRK Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all. \nSAAVIK Ready. \nShe presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly they VANISH. \n123   EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA                           123 \nCAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues, with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead. The sound frightens us, and climaxes with: \n124   INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA                                 124 \nThe BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort- able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief. \nSAAVIK Admiral -- \nShe indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.) \nBONES Genesis, I presume. \nThey walk by a group of crates. It all happens very fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat. \nAt the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has them covered and helpless. \n125   ANGLE FAVORING DAVID                                       125 \nDAVID You're the sonavabitch who committed mass murder up there. \nHe raises the knife -- \nKIRK I'm Admiral Kirk... \nDAVID We were still there, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room -- \nAgain he raises the knife -- \nKIRK Where's Dr. Marcus -- \nDAVID I'm Doctor Marcus! \nCarol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave -- \nCAROL David -- \nDAVID Mother, go back! \nCarol sees Kirk -- \nCAROL Jim -- \nDAVID Go back. I'm going to kill him. \nCAROL (takes a breath) You do that and you'll have murdered your father. \nAll react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the phaser from Jedda. \n126   NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134)                             126 \nTERRELL (cool) I'll hold onto this. \nBut Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches up, trying to smile and touches his hair -- \nCAROL You've got a little grey -- \nShe can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look- ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there, stunned, looking back. \nKIRK Carol. Is that true? \n142   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        142 \nKhan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling. \nKHAN Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend... \nINTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH \n143   ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK                               143 \nKIRK Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target. \nKHAN (ironic) Perhaps I no longer need to try. \nHe punches several buttons. \nIn the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the Genesis torpedo and its arming control box. \nAs Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but Saavik holds him fast -- \nDAVID Let go -- he can't -- ! \nSAAVIK Only half of you would get there. \nThe beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them alone. \nKIRK (desperate) Khan, you have Genesis, but you don't have me! You were going to kill me, Khan, it was your sole purpose. You'll have to come down here to do it! You'll have to come down! \nKHAN'S VOICE I've done far worse than kill you, Admiral. I've hurt you. And I wish to go on hurting you. I shall leave you, as you left me -- where no one will ever find you: poetic justice; marooned for eternity in the center of a dead planet -- buried alive. \nKIRK Khan -- ! \nKHAN Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens. \nKIRK KHAN! \n144   OMITTED                                                    144 \n145   INT.

Chekov stirs -- \nBONES He's alive! \nBones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up. \nKIRK Pavel? \nChekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand -- \nSAAVIK No use, Admiral, they're still jamming all channels. \nBONES (looks across Chekov) It wouldn't make any difference. If Enterprise obeyed orders she's long since gone. And if she couldn't obey, she's finished. \nDAVID So are we, it looks like. \nCAROL I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan? \nKIRK It's a long story. \nDAVID We appear to have plenty of time. \nBONES (dry) You and your father can catch up on things. \nDAVID (bitter) My father. I hope you realize another man has just been killed because of... \nBONES Because of you, son. You shouldn't have tried to rush someone holding a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't one man dead, it's two, in case you've lost count. \nDavid has been effectively spiked. Long silence. \nA huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water- falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a round orb glows sending light and warmth downward. There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern. \n150F   BACK TO KIRK                                              150F \nas Carol comes up beside him. \nKIRK You did this -- in a day?! \nCAROL The matrix formed in a day.

But he can't see the writing -- he rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half-glasses -- \nOne of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes. \nA SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat. \nKIRK Yes... come. \nThe door whooshes open and closes to admit David.

(dry) As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique? \nKIRK (solemn) It had the virtue of never having been tried. \nSPOCK Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality. \nKIRK So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot\u0082g\u0082's first rare -- a trifle emotional -- \nSPOCK She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example. \nKIRK Than you.

Message, Spock? \nSPOCK None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times. \nKirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps: \nKIRK Hrummm... and where are you off to, now? \nSPOCK The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you? \nKIRK (shortly) Home. \nSpock studies him -- \nSPOCK Something oppresses you. \nThey are old friends -- \nKIRK Something. \nHe steps into a turbo elevator.

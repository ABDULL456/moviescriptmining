All the memory cells have been emptied. \nKIRK (ponders) Erased... \nTERRELL He tortured those people. None of them would tell him anything. He went wild, strung them up and slit their throats. He wanted to tear the place apart, but he was late: he had to get back to Reliant in time to blow you to bits. \nKIRK He came damn close... \nCHEKOV He left us. (with irony) We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead? \nTERRELL Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife... \nKIRK I know what he blames me for.

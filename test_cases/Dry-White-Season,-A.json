DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - STAFF ROOM - DAY Tea break for the teachers, Ben       among them. He is enjoy- ing a laugh with his colleagues       -- maybe in Afrikaans -- we should hear the language here       where we need not com- prehend. An African serves the        tea.

GORDON Mister Ben, sir. If it was me, all right. And if it was Emily, all right. We are not young. But he's out child. My time and your time, it's passing. But the time of our children is coming. And now if they kill our children -- if we let them -- what is it that we lived for? BEN (places a hand on Gordon's shoulder -- comforting) What can we do, Gordon? You or I... We can't change it. GORDON That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they whipped Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing.

He died on the day of the riots. \nGORDON That's what  they say. But I got to know for  certain. How can I have peace?   I must know how my son died and  where they buried him. \nThe game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the whistle. The kids run off past Ben and Gordon. Gordon climbs onto the small lawn mower and STARTS the ENGINE. BEN Gordon.   The police -- if they've said... GORDON I don't care what they say. He is my child. God is my witness today: I cannot stop before I know what happened and where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and me.

Love to Susan! \nAnd drives off, leaving Ben watching him, shaking his head at the man's obtuseness. EXT. NGUBENE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with a bucket and a pierced tin. Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child. Robert sees Gordon walking slowly to their house and says playfully to the baby: ROBERT Look who's coming? It's baba! Emily turns to look. She immediately realizes that some- thing is wrong. She drops the tin and walks a few steps toward the gate. \nGordon sees her and stops. Emily starts to break down. \nEMILY Oh, no... oh no, Lord. Gordon hurries to embrace her. \nEMILY (sobbing and repeating) Please don't tell me... \nGordon starts to lead her to the house. \nMargaret, Emily's neighbor, comes, hurries, helps her, comforts her, escorting them to the house. \n", "test1_id": 1998, "test2_input": "He laughs again.

STANLEY Emily is dead. \nBen stares at him in stunned disbelief. BEN Emily dead?   How?   When? Stanley doesn't answer - he cries. \nBen grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him. BEN What happened, Stanley?      Oh, my God. Please tell me. STANLEY (between two sobs) A broken heart.

INT. BRUWER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE EVENING \nA very tense Ben is sitting on Professor Bruwer's chair. Melanie is curled up on the old settee. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MELANIE They don't know what you've got and you're a danger to them. I know there's a point of no return, but with our system, one has to plot the route with care. \nBEN That's the main reason for coming here tonight. Melanie, I need your help. Without Emily, we can't pursue our civil suit. The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad. \nMELANIE And your safety also, Ben, lies in the press. (pause) That way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services; here questions can be asked in Parliament. And the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country. BEN You know, Melanie, I'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto. The enemy is ourselves. Our bigotry, our laws, our system. We have our own fight and it's just beginning. MELANIE We better win before the blacks have won. Ben and Melanie laugh. \nBEN Now, before going to the press, I have to have all the documents. I must have two vital affidavits; Dr. Hassiem's, he's detained and Jonathan's friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia. \nMELANIE Zambia? I'm going to Rhodesia... I can go to Zambia. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BEN (surprised) Could you? MELANIE And I can use my British passport. I know my way around Lusaka. \nBEN That would be very useful. \nMelanie jumps off the settee. MELANIE This calls for a drink.    Gin and tonic? \nBEN Please. As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs... her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace of her movement. On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes to the record player. There's a record already on the turntable. \nSuddenly as if rising from a dream, Ben murmurs: BEN Melanie.   Be careful. \nMELANIE (as she plays the record and flippantly) Of course, Ben. She goes into the kitchen. \nAs Melanie hums to herself to     the BLUES MUSIC, in the kitchen, Ben walks over to the     window and furtively glances out, to assure himself     that nobody is watching. He takes then a book on a pile     next to the settee and pages slowly through it. Melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy mood. She places Ben's glass on the side table next to the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit down. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MELANIE Cheers! \nBen raises his glass and touches it with hers. BEN Do be careful. I wouldn't want you hurt. She reaches for his hand. \nMELANIE (with gentleness) Don't worry. \nBEN And hurry back. A new track starts on the RECORD. MELANIE (excited) That's my favorite, Ben. \nJumping up and taking Ben's glass and placing it on the side table, she pulls him to his feet. BEN I can't dance. MELANIE Rugger player? They laugh as they start to dance to the slow BLUES MUSIC. The laughing subsides as they hold each other closer. The dancing starts to lose the beat of the music. They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel- ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as possible against him. They stop dancing.     Ben kisses her.   A long, warm and tender kiss. INT. MELANIE'S BEDROOM \nBen and Melanie in bed. \nHe is kissing her and fondling her passionately. During the love play, Ben reaches for the lightswitch of the bedside lamp, and knocks it over. They make love. \n", "test2_true": "Ben drops the package he was inspecting, back on the shelf and pushes his trolley towards the man to try and see his face. The man moves away. Ben follows him and has decided to confront him. Man picks up a pack of ham. Ben is about to remonstrate with him. \nBEN Listen, you... Just then a LADY and her daughter hurry to the man, push- ing a trolley. Man turns to look at Ben. WOMAN Darling, put that down, it's not good for your cholesterol. BEN (to the man) I'm sorry, my mistake. \nHe pushes his trolley away embarrassed. EXT. SUZETTE'S HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL - DAY The immaculate blue of the pool. Johan hurls himself out of the water, flops down at the side. Suzette and Ben nearby, sitting in the sun. \nPieter at the barbecue, sizzling thick steaks. A servant in white uniform soundlessly laying the table on the patio behind him. The nanny with the baby in the shade. \nBEN -- How's she doing? SUZETTE Better... She's waiting for you to ask her to come home. \nBEN I doubt it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She turns to Ben, squinting in the sun. \nSUZETTE Papa, I don't want to interfere... BEN Then don't. \nA pause. SUZETTE I know this is going to sound strange coming from me... I mean I haven't exactly been supportive for the past months... I can't say I agree with what you've done but I respect you for what you are... ON Johan listening. SUZETTE I'm just... destroyed by what's happening to us as a family. \nBEN Suzette... SUZETTE (interrupts, squeezing his arm.) Please, Papa, for Mom's sake... For all of our sakes... Let's try and patch it up. \nBen smiles sadly at her... Suzette understands.        Johan looks at them. \nMIX TO: EXT. SUZETTE'S HOUSE - LATER \nBen and Johan in the car.        Suzette leans in through the driver's window. SUZETTE Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. BEN Thanks.   I'm glad you understand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: SUZETTE I don't want to worry about you. That search, this vandalism, those shots... they're really after the evidence you've been accumulating ... Can I look after them for you, Papa? \nBen smiles. BEN You don't have to worry.   They'll never find them. SUZETTE (smiling) Where on earth do you keep them? ON Johan looking at Suzette then at Ben with concern. EXT. INDIAN TOWNSHIP - DAY Ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket section of the Asian township. He peers around him, then walks away. Ben knocks at a door. The door is opened cautiously by DR. HASSIEM, a tall, handsome Indian, aged 35 years. His clothes are casual but expensive. His six-year-old daughter, large dark eyes, is clinging to his leg. We recognize the little girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier. \nBEN Dr. Hassiem? I'm Ben Du Toit. I'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene's... \nDR. HASSIEM (raising his hands) The inquest is over, Mr. Du Toit. \nBEN Not for me, Doctor. I've got to know what happened to Gordon. \nDr. Hassiem looks shaky, nervous. DR. HASSIEM I only came home yesterday. After three months in detention and now I'm banned and confined to the house. There's nothing I can do for you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The little girl still clinging to his leg, watching Ben. \nBEN I know it may be painful to you, Doctor, but I need to talk to you. \nDR. HASSIEM How can I be sure you weren't actually sent by them? BEN Ask Emily. Doctor, we are in the process of filing a civil claim. And your help is vital. \nHassiem gives Ben a long look.    He picks up his daughter and opens the door fully. DR. HASSIEM Come in. Ben walks into the large living room, tastefully furnished. \nDR. HASSIEM Sit down. Ben is still looking 'round at the opulence.       He sits in a chair. BEN Thank you for inviting me in. DR. HASSIEM (the little girl on his knees) What do you want to know? \nBEN Just one thing, Doctor. Why did you sign the State Pathologist's report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well? DR. HASSIEM (disconcerted) What makes you think I signed Dr. Jansen's report. BEN The report produced in court had both your signatures on it. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DR. HASSIEM Impossible. \nBEN What did you write in your report? \n", "test2_id": 1999, "test3_input": "BEN (striding) I'll explain later. \nThey hurry out of the building in silence. EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nBen and Johan arriving at the house. An unsympathetic small crowd is there waiting... They react, murmuring in Afrikaans, watching them with hostility as Ben and Johan get out of the car and discover the chaos. The wreckage. The garage and Ben's study have been bombed.

It was a bomb. \nSTANLEY And the papers? \nBEN Don't worry. Safe. Thanks to Johan. Incidentally, I have Wellington's affidavit. Melanie found him. She's being deported. The official reason is that she possessed a British passport. I don't know how she managed to smuggle the envelope to me. \nSTANLEY Man, it's all happening! \nStanley walks out, glances at the devastated study. He reenters the kitchen and slams on a chair.

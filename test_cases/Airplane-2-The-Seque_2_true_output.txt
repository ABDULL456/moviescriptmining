EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - GARDEN AREA - DAY 
Rumack and Elaine walk INTO FRAME still talking. 
RUMACK So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick. 
ELAINE What can I do, Doctor Rumack? 
He stops next to a sign, "HOSPITAL GARDEN." 
RUMACK You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol. 
ELAINE I mean for Ted. 
RUMACK You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden. 
ELAINE Is that a good sign, Doctor? 
Rumack holds the "HOSPITAL GARDEN" sign. 
RUMACK It does the job. 
ANGLE ON TED 
He is ripping up small trees, shrubs, etc., and throwing them onto a huge pile of mud that resembles the mountain that Dreyfuss built in "Close Encounters." 
ELAINE Hello, Ted. 
Ted ignores her as he works frantically. 
ELAINE (holding out box) I brought you some spaghetti. 
Ted still ignores her as he works feverishly. 
ELAINE What are you doing, Ted? 
TED I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle! 
Ted scurries around. 
ELAINE Ted. 
TED Not now, Elaine! 
ELAINE Ted! 
He ignores her.  Rumack walks up and puts an arm around her shoulder.  Elaine starts to sob. 
RUMACK The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine. 
ELAINE Is he making any progress, Doctor? 
RUMACK Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.

124     REAR DECK - SAME TIME                                  124 
Finnegan and Trillian race out onto the rear deck just as the HARPOON HOOK finishes TEARING the railing off the ship. The HOOK, the TOW- LINE, and the ENTIRE RAILING DROP over the side and fall OUT OF SIGHT. The TWO BOATS are now UNCOUPLED. Finnegan reels at the rain soaked sky. 
FINNEGAN Will somebody give me a break here? 
And that's when Finnegan and Trillian hear the SOUND of a HYDRAULIC HOIST. They look over -- 
125     AT THE WATERSPORTS PLATFORM:                           125 
The speedboat is being hydraulically lowered into the water. Canton sits inside, fiddling with the ignition. ANGLE ON: Trillian and Finnegan racing down the spiral stairs leading to the watersports platform. 
TRILLIAN Wait! Stop! 
The boat touches down into the water. 
CANTON I'd like to but I have an appointment with my insurance broker! 
He HITS the HOIST-RELEASE BUTTON. The speedboat breaks free. Canton HITS the IGNITION. The boat's ENGINE ROARS. 
CANTON (CONT'D) Life takes the damndest turns, doesn't it? 
He red-lines the THROTTLE. The SPEEDBOAT HAULS ASS away from the cruiseliner. Canton steers for the island. Smiling. 
ANGLE ON: Trillian 
IN HER RAGE... 
TRILLIAN You son of a bitch!! 
She grabs Finnegan's pulse rifle, hefts it to her shoulder... 
FINNEGAN Look! 
He forces her to look in the distance. Their POV. The island. 
TRILLIAN Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there? 
FINNEGAN Not like him. 
Finnegan points to the water...and an INKY PSEUDOPOD FORM racing after the speedboat underwater. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) It's the engine...it can hear the engine...it goes for the loudest sound... 
The Tentacle quickly picks up speed, going faster and faster, getting closer and closer, stretching further and further. Suddenly, behind them, a METALLIC THRASHING SOUND is HEARD. They turn around and look -- The hook, the tow-line, and the entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis, trying to tear free -- The Saipan is still clinging by its fingernails to the Fuji Maru! Finnegan races over to a WINCH and grabs the winch- line. 
CUT TO: 
126     SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT                                      126 
Canton, smiling brightly, peers at the approaching island through the speedboat's windscreen. So relieved he sings to himself, from the operetta H.M.S. PINAFORE. 
CANTON Oh we sail the ocean blue, and our mighty ship's a beauty. We are strong men, yes it's true, and responsive to our duty... 
When...YANK!!...the SPEEDBOAT is GRABBED from below, practically exploding as it DISINTEGRATES into TWO PIECES. Canton is PROPELLED through the windscreen and onto the hood. 
CUT TO: 
127     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            127 
Finnegan struggles to clip the winch-line onto the tow-line, hanging precariously over the edge of the ship, clip in one hand, winch-line in the other. The whole METAL MESS is BUCKING and TWISTING and SCREECHING. His every joint is being ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the line before the entire rig tears away into the sea. 
With one last heroic effort of will and grit, he snaps the clip in place just as it all BREAKS LOOSE. One of the JET SKIS and the ENTIRE RAILING are RIPPED over the side and fall down into the ocean. Finnegan is also YANKED over the side, but he manages to hold on by his fingers, dangling precariously. 
FINNEGAN Hit it! Hit it! 
The HOOK and the TOW-LINE drop -- then SNAP TAUGHT as the winch-line holds them tight. 
Trillian throws the start lever on the winch. The WINCH KICKS ON and starts reeling in the Saipan. Finnegan tries to crawl up on the deck, exhausted. Trillian reaches down and pulls him the rest of the way up. He half collapses on top of her. 
TRILLIAN You know, Finnegan, I'm starting to believe what you said about you not being born to die on a luxury liner. 
Despite the grimness of their position, the closeness of their bodies is...a turn on...to both of them...and then a SCREAM from the sea. They look in the direction of...

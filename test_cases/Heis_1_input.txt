BELLA ...I only 
MOORE I don't want you to do anything unless and until... we hit the City, ditch the car. 
BELLA ...I'll... 
MOORE You do it, you do it. (PAUSE) You do it, Pinky... 
HE WIPES HIS HAND OVER HIS MOUSTACHE.    TAKES OFF HIS HARDHAT, AND WIPES THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW. 
INT BOAT REPAIR SHOP NIGHT 
A SPRAY OF SPARKS FROM A WELDING UNIT. 
ANGLE 
ON MOORE, AS HE PUTS UP THE SHIELD ON A WELDER'S MASK, WIPES HIS BROW, PUTS THE SHIELD DOWN AGAIN, AND CONTINUES CUTTING WITH AN ACETYLENE TORCH ON A LARGE, INDUSTRIAL AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT. 
ANGLE 
IN THE B.G. A RYDER RENTAL TRUCK. 
ANGLE.   ON PINCUS AND BLANE, AS A LONG ASSEMBLY TABLE. 
BLANE HOLDS A LEGAL PAD, AND IS MAKING NOTATIONS ON IT. 
HE SPEAKS TO PINCUS, AS CAMERA PANS OVER THE TABLE, HOLDING ON BLANE'S HANDS AS HE CHECKS THE VARIOUS PROPS. 
WE SEE: A SECURITY GUARD'S UNIFORM. A LEATHER BADGECASE, HOLDING A GOLD BADGE, SEVERAL SMALL METAL CANNISTERS, A TOOLKIT, A UTILITY BELT HOLDING TOOLS. SEVERAL WALKIE TALKIES. 
PINCUS AND BLANE CONVERSE, V.O. 
PINCUS The thing of it is, the thing of it is, it's a question of redistribution... 
BLANE How's that? 
PINCUS The question: how do we get the money from there to here... it's just a question in logistics. 
BLANE "What is the robbing of a bank, compared with the founding of a bank?" 
PINCUS Who said that? 
BLANE Anybody ever applied for a loan. 
ANGLE 
ON THE TWO, AS BLANE HANDS THE CLIPBOARD TO PINCUS. 
PINCUS (cont'd) ...load it up? 
BLANE NODS. THEY BEGIN HAULING THESE PROPS AND SUPPLIES INTO THE TRUCK, AND LOADING THEM INTO THE "FALSE" (HOLLOW) ENGINE. 
BLANE LOOKS OUT OF THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. 
ANGLE, HIS POV.   A CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE THE SHED.   BELLA GETS OUT. 
ANGLE 
ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS INTO THE SHED.   HE TAKES OUT AN ENVELOPE. 
ANGLE, ON BLANE, WHO OPENS THE ENVELOPE.    TO REVEAL CASH INSIDE. 
BELLA ...expenses for the truck, and... 
BLANE Yeah, I got it. I got it.     Okay. 
BELLA WALKS OFF, AS FRAN ENTERS FROM THE "LIVING" AREA OF THE BOATSHED, HOLDING TWO CUPS OF COFFEE. 
FRAN STARTS TO OPEN HER MOUTH, SMILING, AS HE STARTS TO PUT DOWN THE CUP OF COFFEE, MOORE GIVES HER AN INFINITESSIMAL SHAKE OF HER HEAD. AND MOTIONS TOWARD BELLA. FRAN NODS IN AGREEMENT, AND, NOT BREAKING HER STRIDE, WALKS TOWARD BELLA. 
BELLA (TO FRAN) Well, then... 
FRAN ...that's right. (PAUSE) 
BELLA ...long time. (PAUSE) 
FRAN ...that's right. 
ANGLE 
ON MOORE, LOOKING AT THEM. 
ANGLE, HIS POV: 
BELLA AND FRAN, IN THE B.G., BELLA CHATTING FRAN UP. 
ANGLE 
ON BLANE AS HE WALKS OVER TO MOORE, AT THE WELDING STATION.     HE HANDS MOORE THE ENVELOPE. 
BLANE The plan gonna work? 
MOORE It's gonna work if we make it work.   How's Fran doing? 
BLANE Looks like he maybe wantsa take her to the Prom. 
MOORE SMILES, AND NODS. 
MOORE Well, it's always the pretty girl stays home, innit? 
BLANE Izzat what they said in the White Community...? 
MOORE That's what I hear. 
BLANE And I hear, if you get a goose, it keeps the fox off the chickens. (LOOKS AT FRAN AND BELLA) What does that lady see in you, by the way? 
MOORE I'm very resilient. 
BLANE Yeah, so's Gumby. 
MOORE I got a more striking profile. 
PINCUS WALKS UP.   HE AND BLANE WALK ACROSS THE SHOP FLOOR, BLANE LIMPS SLIGHTLY. 
BLANE They're gonna leave that on the cutting room floor, Buenos Aires.

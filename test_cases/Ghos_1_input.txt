INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
It is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone. Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn. 
Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, smiling. 
SAM Search, you bastard! You'll never find it. It's gone. (he smiles) They'll kill you for this, Carl. You and Willie. They'll wipe you off the face of the earth. 
In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing is working. 
Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer, hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off. Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it back on again. Carl stares at it. 
CARL What the...? 
Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down, mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense. The word "M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R" is emerging before him. 
Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman. 
CARL (continuing) Who's doing that? 
There is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word appears. "S-A-M". 
Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for breath. 
Sam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his ribs. 
SAM You bastard! You goddamn bastard! 
Carl grabs his side. 
CARL Ah! 
He hits Carl again. Carl gasps in inexplicable pain. 
SAM It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you have a date with Molly, you creepy son-of-a bitch? 
Sam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section. Carl doubles over as though he's going to throw up. 
CARL Jesus! Oh God! 
Sam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk. He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes stark white as the attack continues. 
Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room. 
INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT 
Molly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair, asleep. Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door. He does not look well. Sam is with him. 
MOLLY Carl? Where were you? I thought we were having...? 
CARL I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy. I completely forgot. 
SAM Old Carl had a little trouble at the office. 
MOLLY Forgot? I was worried. Is everything okay? Are you all right? 
CARL I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I talk to you for minute? Can I come in? 
Molly eyes Carl with concern as he enters the loft. 
CARL (continuing) I need to ask you a question. 
SAM He needs to borrow four million dollars. 
CARL Molly, I know what the police said, but when you thought Sam was here, when you thought he spoke to you, what did you feel? What did he say? 
MOLLY Why? What happened? 
CARL (very tense) Molly, that psychic woman, I want to know what she told you. I want to know what she said. 
MOLLY Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. I told you. It wasn't real. She's a charlatan. (she hesitates and stares at Carl) Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today? 
SAM Oh shit! 
CARL (gulping) At the bank? 
Sam tenses. He holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop. 
MOLLY I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says she was taking out money. It turns out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. It's Rita Miller or something. 
Carl turns white. His eyes bulge. He feels sick. 
MOLLY (continuing) What's wrong? 
CARL Stomach. My stomach. Do you have anything? Pepto Bismol. 
MOLLY (worried) Sure. Just a second. What's going on?

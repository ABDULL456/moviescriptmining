Bloom lowers the gun, trembling. 
BLOOM Ask him if anyone else is here. 
She does. 
BOY Nyet. 
BLOOM Ask him where the Diamond Dog is. 
PENELOPE Diamond Dog? (in Russian) Where is the Diamond Dog? 
BOY (in English) The Dog of Diamonds is gone. 
Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and gets a quick answer. 
BLOOM Get the car started. 
PENELOPE What about him? 
BLOOM It's alright. 
213   CONTINUED: (2)                                            213 
She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the boy. 
BLOOM (cont'd) You don't need to be afraid of him anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever come back here again. He doesn't concern you anymore. Understand? It's gonna be ok. 
The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off. 
214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214 
Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her. 
He sprints towards her, screaming 
BLOOM Get out!   Get out of the car!! 
She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down. 
A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope with glass. 
The Mercedes roars off down the street. 
Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open. 
Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian nesting doll. 
215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215 
The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and Penelope holds a note. 
PENELOPE It's a ransom note. It says they have Stephen, it says they want the money wired to a specific account, they give a bank to do it at and a manager to ask for. (MORE) 
215   CONTINUED:                                               215 PENELOPE (cont'd) Then an address to come to, at two p.m. In two hours. 
BLOOM I'll wire the money from my account, and we'll go get Stephen. 
PENELOPE It's a lot. 
BLOOM How much? 
PENELOPE I'll do it, I want to, I've got plenty- 
BLOOM How much are they asking for? 
PENELOPE One point seven five million. 
A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach. 
BLOOM Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO. 
He punches the dashboard. 
BLOOM (cont'd) No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if that's what this is, if that's all that this is, no NO NO. 
PENELOPE What are you talking about? 
BLOOM There's another possibility that I should of, I'm a fucking idiot. This might all be a con. By my brother. To get me - oh god - he wanted me to face the Dog, to end it, and he gets your money. Oh god. I'm going to be sick. 
PENELOPE Would he do that? To you? 
BLOOM I don't know. Yes.   Yes of course he would. (MORE) 
215   CONTINUED: (2)                                              215 BLOOM (cont'd) To tell a story so well it becomes real. The perfect con. That's his whole, goddammit, that's what. 
PENELOPE But you don't know. Let's transfer the money. You don't know. 
BLOOM Son of a bitch. 
PENELOPE You don't know. This is your brother's life. I'm gonna wire the money. 
216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216 
Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard again, helpless enraged and scared. 
Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

RACHAEL For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share. 
The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her. 
DECKARD You got it wrong, girl.  I work with the bureau not for them. 
He lets it sink in. 
DECKARD My job isn't to detect malfunctioning andies, it's to eliminate them.  The more the better. 
He walks out of the elevator first. 
INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34 
The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE BREWING in the background. 
Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule and face another door, this one befitting the decor of the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as they enter. 
RACHAEL Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell. 
TYRELL How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please sit down.  Would you care for a cup of coffee? 
DECKARD Thanks. 
TYRELL Black? 
DECKARD Please. 
Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth. 
TYRELL Somehow, I didn't expect that the man who did the dirty work would be the man to do the technical work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard. 
He hands Deckard a cup of coffee. 
TYRELL Is this to be an empathy test? 
DECKARD Yes. 
TYRELL Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris? 
Deckard nods. 
TYRELL May I ask a personal question? 
DECKARD Go ahead. 
TYRELL Have you ever retired a human by mistake? 
DECKARD No. 
TYRELL But in your profession that is a risk. 
DECKARD Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof. 
TYRELL Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it? 
DECKARD One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject? 
TYRELL Sitting next to you. 
Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted, Tyrell takes a cup of coffee. 
Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and starts fishing out the apparatus. 
THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35 
Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot with light, the pupil contracting. 
DECKARD'S VOICE Ready. 
RACHAEL Go ahead. 
In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her cheeks. 
DECKARD You're given a calfskin wallet for your birthday.

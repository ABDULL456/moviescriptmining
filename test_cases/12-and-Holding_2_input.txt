Leonard is slumped over, unconscious. 
INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME 
Grace coughs hard. 
GRACE Leonard, don't you smell that...? (sotto) Oh God, he can't. Leonard! Leonard, the gas is on! 
Grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the stairs. After a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing. 
With the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap. 
Luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side. With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing. 
INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Exhausted and wheezing, Grace drags herself over to the stove and shuts the gas off. She looks around for Leonard and sees him in the living room, slumped over and unconscious. 
GRACE No! 
Grace frantically shuffles over to the living room. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Leonard, wake up! Leonard! 
INT. HOSPTIAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Leonard slowly comes to in a hospital bed.       The same nurse from earlier is by his side. 
NURSE It's alive! 
LEONARD What happened? 
NURSE Gas leak. 
LEONARD My mom, she's... 
NURSE She's fine. They've taken her into surgery. She blew out her knees somehow. We're trying to get your father on the phone right now. 
LEONARD I... 
NURSE Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
Jacob straddles his bike, watching a crew spread cement over the foundation of a house. Jacob appears lost in thought. He looks at a picture of Rudy and himself together. 
Jacob touches his face in the photograph. He traces his finger along the outline of his birthmark. 
KENNY (O.S.) Tonight, we ride. 
EXT. TRAILER PARK - BESIDE KENNY'S TRAILER - DUSK 
Jacob and Kenny share a cigarette. 
KENNY We got sleeping bags, a tent, canteens and a lantern. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: KENNY (cont'd) I heard it's supposed to rain, so I'll bring ponchos. 
JACOB (half hearted) Cool. 
Kenny eyes Jacob. 
KENNY You're acting weird.    You gonna chicken out? 
JACOB No. 
KENNY You better not. I already packed twice the amount of shit. I can't carry it all alone. 
JACOB I'll be there. 
KENNY Good. I'm telling you, man. It's gonna be great. 
JACOB I guess. 
KENNY Come on. You can't be a pussy all your life. 
JACOB (beat, hauntingly) I know.

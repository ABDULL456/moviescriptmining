Sensing this, George snaps out of it, grabs the BOX OF PARAFFIN near the back of the shelf, and hurries back up the stairs, slamming the door in our/It's face. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Will melts a chunk of paraffin with a match in a ceramic bowl, then dips his finger into the hot liquid and smears the wax along the sides of the boat. 
GEORGE Can I do some? 
WILL Okay. Just don't get any on my blankets or Mom'll freak. 
George dips his finger and spreads it. 
GEORGE Too cool. 
They finish up and Will gives the boat to George. 
WILL There you go. She's all yours. 
GEORGE She? 
WILL You're the Captain, ain't   ya? Captains call their boats   she. Now put on your rain stuff or   you'll wind up stuck in bed like   your stupid brother. 
They both grin, the cozy room full of cheerful brotherly love. George kisses Will on the cheek, startling him. 
GEORGE Thanks, Willy. 
He goes. Will looks to the rain-lashed window, piano still playing. He's suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding. 
WILL Be careful out there! 
EXT. WITCHAM STREET - DAY 
A DEAD TRAFFIC LIGHT sways overhead, its dripping black lenses gazing back at A BOY IN A YELLOW SLICKER AND RED GALOSHES. 
Georgie races down the street past dark houses after his PAPER BOAT, which sluices along a gutter swollen with rushing rainwater. 
Rain taps on George's hood sounding to his ears like rain on a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes. 
The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF DERRY PUBLIC WORKS, where a gouge in the blacktop sends it sweeping diagonally across toward a STORM DRAIN. 
George races after, trying to grab the boat before it's swallowed up with all the rainwater. He SLIPS AND SPILLS to the blacktop, crying out in pain. 
The PAPER BOAT surfs up to the drain, circles around twice, and goes in. George look ready to cry. 
GEORGE Willy's gonna kill me. 
He walks over to the drain and peers in, water falling into darkness. A dank hollow sound comes from within. Suddenly 
EYES PEER BACK AT HIM -- from THE GREASY WHITE FACE OF A CLOWN. Not Bozo, or Ronald McDonald, but something more old world, freakish, like that of a 19th-century acrobat -- bald, lithe, almost child-like. Meet PENNYWISE aka BOB GRAY. 
George recoils back, shocked by Pennywise's presence. A VOICE, a perfectly pleasant and reasonable voice, rises up. 
PENNYWISE (O.C.) Hello, Georgie. 
George looks around him. 
An OLD WOMAN watches him from the kitchen window of a house just behind the drain. 
CUT TO: POV from the OLD WOMAN's house. She turns her attention back to her cat, scraping out the wet innards of a can of tuna into a plate on the window sill. 
PENNYWISE (O.C.) (CONT'D) Lost something? 
George expression mellows from fear to child-like wonder, like he's seeing a circus bear balanced on a ball . 
GEORGE How did you get down there? 
PENNYWISE Me? Why the storm of course. Just bleeeew me away. It blew the whole circus away. How'd you like to join the circus, Georgie? 
The faint, off-key sound of CALLIOPE MUSIC can be heard. George inches closer to the storm drain. 
GEORGE Is there cotton candy? 
PENNYWISE Cotton candy? Oh yes. Cotton candy and bearded women and elephant shit and all the balloons a little boy could want. You like balloons, don't you Georgie? 
GEORGE I sure do. Do they float? 
George takes one last fatal step forward. 
PENNYWISE Float? Oh indeed they do, Georgie. Indeed they do. Everything down here floats. And when you're down here with us... 
The clown's sing-songy voice curdles into something horrible, primal even, as George's arm is seized by Pennywise's unusually LONG arm and CLAW-like hand. 
PENNYWISE (CONT'D) YOU'LL FLOAT TOO! 
George's SCREEEEEAAAAAM rings through the sewers as we... 
CUT TO the OLD WOMAN's POV again. The cat devours its food, the old woman pleased with his appetite does not notice... 
RACK FOCUS... Georgie's rag doll body flung left and right as Pennywise feeds on him and tries to pull him through the metal grate into the sewer. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Soaring, percussive MUSIC crescendos over a wide shot of glacier-cut mountains. Then, SILENCE. 
TITLE CARD: 
JUNE 1988 EXT. DERRY - AERIAL - SAME 
PAN OFF glacier-cut mountains to reveal the TOWN OF DERRY, MAINE, settled on a crosscut of the Penobscot River and Kenduskaeg stream. It's a sturdy, picturesque Northeastern town like any other, its rough-hewn industrial past bleeding through a gentrified, decaying present. 
TILT STRAIGHT DOWN to HANLON ABATOIR

LOKI You're a Valkyrie. I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths? 
Now Val ATTACKS Loki! She gets him up against the wall, her blade against his throat. She looks ready to kill him. 
VALKYRIE Choose your next words wisely. 
LOKI Terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory... 
Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val's head and CASTS an illusion. Val's eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to: 
65   EXT. HELA'S DIMENSION - FLASHBACK                                 65 
A barren black void of death. 
The VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge through the DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nine Realms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time. 
- Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere. 
- Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space. 
- The Valkyrie's winged horses lay dead on the battlefield. 
- Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard. 
- Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val, frozen in fear, shell-shocked. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               80. 
- Hela FIRING black weapons at Val... 
- One of Val's sisters DIVING IN at the last second, SHOVING VAL back through the PORTAL and taking the fatal hit! 
- Val lands hard in the Throne room. 
- Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rift but it's too late. It closes, the last image she sees is Hela dealing the final killer blow to her doomed Valkyrie sisters. 
66   EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS                          66 
We find Val on her knees in front of Loki, trembling from this visceral memory that she's tried so hard to suppress. 
She turns on Loki, raging, and knocks him out. 
69   EXT. SAKAAR - STOOP - DAY                                       69 
BANNER sits, groaning, head in his hands. THOR is beside him, rubbing his back and on the lookout for threats. 
THOR The sun's going down. It's getting really low. The sun's going down. It's getting real low. 
BANNER Would you stop saying that!? 
THOR I just need you to stay calm. 
BANNER Calm!?   I'm on an alien planet! 
THOR It's just a planet.   You've been on a planet before. 
BANNER Yeah!    One! 
THOR Now you've been on two. That's a good thing. It's a new experience. 
BANNER My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16       81. 
BANNER (CONT'D) The whole thing is totally different this time. (beat) In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel, but this time it's like he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk. 
THOR Alright, well, you're back now, that's all that matters. 
BANNER No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may never come back. And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out. 
THOR We're not stranded, I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home. 
BANNER Thank you. 
THOR Not your home, though.   Asgard. 
BANNER What? 
THOR Listen, my people are in great danger. You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister. 
BANNER Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue. 
THOR No, she's an evil being. 
BANNER I don't care what she is.   I'm not fighting any more beings.   I'm sick of it. I just told you. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16             82. 
BANNER (CONT'D) If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again. And you don't care. 
THOR No, no. I'm putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire. 
BANNER Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk. 
THOR What?   No! 
BANNER It's gross. You don't care about me. You're not my friend. 
THOR No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like... "smash, smash, smash." I prefer you. 
BANNER Thanks. 
THOR But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful. 
BANNER Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too. 
THOR Is he though? 
BANNER How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero. How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

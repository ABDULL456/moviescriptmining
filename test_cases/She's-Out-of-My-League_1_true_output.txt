ERIC Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants to discuss the will. She won't tell us dick, so we're kind of hoping you can grease the wheels. 
KIRK Okay, but you know Grammy didn't have all that much. Once the hospital and... and the ah... 
ERIC Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what not... 
KIRK Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over. 
DEBBIE We've got a wedding to pay for, Kirk and... 
ERIC Debbie, let me handle this. We've got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts, and you know Mom and Dad are going to Branson next month. Now you always been Grammy's favorite so we're counting on you to get in there and sort out what's what. 
INT. HOSPITAL - GRAMMY'S ROOM 
In a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed. She is hooked up to an I.V. and several monitors. Kirk comes in and forces a smile. Grammy's voice is weak and shaky. 
GRAMMY There you are Big Slick.   Did you bring 'em? 
KIRK Grammy, you really shouldn't... 
GRAMMY Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's door and you know it. 
Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes. 
GRAMMY (CONT'D) Oh, for Christ's sake. Filters? 
Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. Kirk tears up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life. 
KIRK I love you Grammy. 
GRAMMY Don't start that shit now. You're looking at one lucky old broad who's done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby, colored fellas. I got no complaints. So when the check comes I don't want any blubbering or bullshit outta you. Just enjoy your life like I did mine and raise a glass to your old Grammy once in a while. 
Kirk hugs her and he cries a bit. 
GRAMMY (CONT'D) You know how much I love you Kirk. 
INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY 
Molly is coming through Kirk's lane again. Mr. Fuller steps in and stops her before she crosses through. 
FULLER Ma'am, could you please remove your jacket and shoes? 
MOLLY Oh, sure. 
She does. Fuller is leering at her stellar body.   She's about to go through when he stops her again. 
FULLER Why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it. 
Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt. She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a raised palm. He then motions to her breasts and crotch. 
FULLER (CONT'D) Any piercings you'd like me to know about? 
KIRK Why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine. 
Molly steps through. The machine does not go off. She gathers her things and mouths a silent, "Thank You" to Kirk as she walks on. Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say anything, RANDY, a young agent, calls out from the office. 
RANDY Kirk buddy! Phone call! 
Kirk walks over to take the call. 
FULLER You best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too, mister! 
Kirk takes the phone from Randy. 
KIRK This is Kirk Kettner. 
Kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in. 
INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee. He opens his wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an eight-year-old Kirk in a casino. Grammy is smoking a cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table. 
Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands. 
Molly is passing.   She sees Kirk and stops.

NATE Fifty, to cover them all. 
FRANK A hundred. And it's all I got left. So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - (embraces Nate and whispers) Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down. 
He holds out a business envelope fat with money. Nate hesitates, knowing Frank has just said he'll kill him if things don't go right, then takes it. 
NATE I'll let you know when it's in the air. 
56    INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NEWARK - DAWN                            56 
The nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the cops. The phone rings. And won't stop. Neither will the nurse as Richie answers it - 
RIVERA V/O Richie? Richie, I'm in trouble.    This fuckin guy "made" me - I don't know how but he did. He went for his gun. I had to do it, I swear to God. Now they're going to kill me. 
Richie can hear in Sander's voice how serious it is and manages to disentangle himself from the woman. RICHIE Who. 
RIVERA V/O There's a hundred people out there heard the shots. You gotta help me. You gotta do something. 
RICHIE Is he dead? 
RIVERA V/O He's dead.    I'm dead. They're gonna kill me. 
RICHIE Where are you? Javy, where are you?

RIVERA V/O That's the problem. 
A57   INT. RICHIE'S CAR - MOVING - EARLY MORNING                      A57 
Richie on his police radio, which cuts in and out - 
DISPATCHER There are no cars in that area, Detective Roberts. 
RICHIE Bullshit. I got a man in trouble and I need back-up. 
DISPATCHER I missed that - you're breaking up - 
RICHIE I said, put the fucking call out again - 
DISPATCHER I just did. No one responded.     I'll try again, but - 
RICHIE Fuck you, too. 
He slams the mic down. 
57    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            57 
As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects - the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark 30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument. 
He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive heat. It's riot weather. 
58    INT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            58 
Drugs on a coffee table. Body on the floor. Rivera, despondent, on the couch. The male paramedics, scared. Richie on the phone - 
RICHIE Sergeant, I'm not asking, I'm fuckin telling you: Get some patrolmen over here now.

Dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him.           Richie throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him. 
PARAMEDIC You got no back-up? Why is that? 
The only other person who would know the answer to that is Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair. 
RICHIE Bandage his head. 
PARAMEDIC Detective ... he's dead. 
RICHIE I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his head, clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he's sitting. And open his eyes. 
59    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                              59 
Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance. 
RICHIE Step back, injured man coming out. Let them do their job and he'll be all right. Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir. Please. 
The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney: tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away - 
A60   EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                  A60 
They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief. 
RIVERA Thank you - 
The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him up against a car. 
RICHIE You robbed him, didn't you.

Call flies deftly through the trees, away, away, then spins out, heads back for the beast at TOP SPEED, the wind roars as she closes 
The newborn spins and she SLAMS into it, it goes flying, screaming in pain,  the harvester bouncing off it, flipping over, CRASHING against the trees and landing tilted upside down, Call unconscious between it and the ground. 
The newborn shudders, rises, makes for the harvester -- it clearly pissed. 
Ripley pulls herself over the ridge, sees the situation, rushes toward them. 
Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine.  Terrified, but determined, she reaches for a lever 
RIPLEY 
No! Over here! 
Calling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms. 
CALL 
Ripley!  Let it come!  Let it come! 
Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever. The beast is torn, and for a  moment doesn't move. 
Ripley looks over to where Call is, and understanding blooms on her face. 
She looks around and spots: 
ANGLE: THE GRENADE LAUNCHER 
Halfway between her and the newborn. 
For a moment neither of them moves.  Then Ripley RUNS, the newborn comes at her with equal speed, like they're playing chicken, Ripley DIVES at the ground, rolls, comes up holdin the grenade launcher, and she FIPES! 
The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time, and it rears back, screaming - 
- Ripley FIRES and FIRES, driving it back toward the upended harvester. 
The alien rears up to its full height, and Ripley pulls.the trigger. There is a hollow click. 
Furious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast.  A SSCREAM wells up in her throat and she 
THROWS herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and sending both  of them tumbling onto the Harvester. 
Call pulls the lever. 
In an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes. 
And it SHRIEKS, a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically. 
Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close -- but the beast grabs her, holds her.  The blades ever closer as she struggles with it. 
ANGLE: CALL 
Still trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the machine all around her! 
She squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck.  A stream of blood lands on her shoulder, eating it away.  Another on her leg, and panic blooms, bright in her. 
CALL 
RIPLEY! 
Galvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself out of the beast's dying grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and spark, blood eating through the controls. 
Call writhes, blood everywhere now.  She is lost in primal terror. 
Ripley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood splattering her, wrenchs Call free.  She drags her' out. 
A section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the dying alien. 
Call lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around her. 
Covered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames, breathing hard,  holding each other as if their lives depended on it still. 
DISSOLVE TO.- ANGLE: THE NEWBORN'S SKULL 
Burning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it.  Collapsing gently on itself. 
WIDE ANGLE: 
EXT.  SAME - LATER 
The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire, watching the flames. 
Vriess tosses 'Christie a bottle of whiskey. 
JOHNER 
The bitch takes her time in burning. 
VRIESS 
Well, it looks like she's finally giving it up. 
JOHNER 
Troopers should be finding our ship any time now. 1 don't much love the idea of being around when they do. 
Ripley gets up, looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city. 
Christie offers the bottle to Call.  She takes it and drinks. 
VRIESS (to Call) 
I guess you won't want to be answering any official Questions either. 
CALL 
I guess not. 
She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together. 
VRIESS 
Well, we're on Earth, for Chrissake. Plenty of places to get lost here. 
CALL 
So I've heard. 
After a moment, she gets up as well, goes over to Ripley.  She hands her the bottle. 
Ripley looks at it. 
CALL 
It's a drink.  You drink it. 
RIPLEY (smiling) I remember. She drinks. 
CALL 
So, what do you think? 
RIPLEY 
Think? 
CALL 
What should we do now? 
RIPLEY 
I don't know.

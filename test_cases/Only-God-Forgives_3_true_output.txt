INT. / EXT. CAR - DAY 
The car's parked outside Gordon's apartment block. Gordon's not shown. Julian's calling him... 
JULIAN We're outside. 
GORDON (V.O.) Sorry mate, something's come up. Julian pauses. Can't believe it. 
JULIAN I need you here. Right now. 
GORDON (V.O.) I know but... I'm busy. What I'm doing, it's important. I'm sorry mate. Julian's incredibly frustrated but hasn't got time to argue. 
JULIAN Okay. Julian kills his phone. He's still for a moment, then: 
JULIAN (CONT'D) Let's make a move.

INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Julian is walking around Chang's apartment... looking at all family pictures... getting a sense of how they live. He opens drawers and closets and studies all the photos of Chang as a boxer and soldier. ...on a wall is a framed article in Thai that Charlie Ling is reading. 
JULIAN What's it say? Charlie starts reading the article out: 
CHARLIE LING "Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah, came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year, waking up as if nothing had happened... Wife was really happy, blah blah blah... "It's hard to describe" Chang said, "but I do feel different." Charlie starts to sneer as he reads. Julian is listening intently. 
CHARLIE LING (CONT'D) "I experienced something metaphysical, impossible to explain... I travelled to many places and saw many things... And when I woke up I was no longer the man I once was..." 
JULIAN The Angel Of Vengeance.

NICK And, action. 
INT. THE SET. TAKE ONE 
Instantly the film cuts from color to B/W. Chad and Nicole begin their Love Scene. 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
PALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. 
The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move. He goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole. 
NICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? 
PALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. 
PALOMINO (finally moves to his mark) Why didn't you tell me? 
NICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. 
PALOMINO God. And all this time I thought... 
Palomino and Nicole embrace. Their kiss, like the entire scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful. 
INT. THE SET 
NICK Cut. Very good. 
WOLF Not for camera. Chad was completely out of frame. 
NICK Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy? Forget your cue? 
PALOMINO Oh no, man. I held back. It really felt like something Damian would do; holding back to the last moment. 
NICK Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf? 
WOLF I don't care when he moves. Just give me a fucking cue. 
PALOMINO The Lone Wolf! 
NICK What line did he move on? 
SCRIPT "Why didn't you tell me?" 
NICK Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole, how does that feel to you? 
NICOLE Fine, if that's what Chad wants to do. 
PALOMINO "Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's shoot; I'm stoked! 
NICK One second, Chad. 
Nick approaches the bed and speaks quietly to Chad and Nicole. 
NICK Chad, how would you describe this scene, in one word? 
PALOMINO Great. It's a great scene, man. 
NICK No, I mean it's a love scene. Right? 
PALOMINO Definitely. 
NICK These two people really love each other. And we want to see that, especially in the kiss. 
PALOMINO Hey, say no more, Chief.

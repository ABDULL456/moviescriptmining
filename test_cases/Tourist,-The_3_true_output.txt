INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - NIGHT 
Ackerman is tilted back with his eyes closed like he has a headache. 
Jones enters with a file labelled:    "Frank Taylor". 
ACKERMAN What did we find on the American? 
JONES He's a tourist. Member of the teacher's union. Pays his taxes. Has bad luck. 
ACKERMAN Evidently. He had a pair of Russian hit men after him. Are you still going to tell me Demidov is clean? 
JONES I never said he is clean.    I just said he isn't our target. 
GOYAL I'm just wondering how they tracked them down at the hotel... 
ACKERMAN (under his breath) Just so long as they don't beat us to Pearce when the real one arrives. 
He looks up at Goyal. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) Where's the teacher now? 
GOYAL The local police picked him up. 
ACKERMAN Then he's safely out of the way. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Frank sits up in his bed, reading. 
The PHONE RINGS. 
FRANK Hello? 
INT. TERRACE FLAT, PADUA - EVENING 
INTERCUT: Domenico - in his terrace flat. He wears a T- shirt and holds a glass of wine. Loud Italian pop music plays in the background. 
DOMENICO Well it's official Mr. Taylor. You're not mad. 
FRANK That's a relief. 
DOMENICO I went to the hotel. Somebody shot at somebody. I found a shell casing. I'll have it analyzed in the morning. 
Frank glances around uncomfortably. 
FRANK I'd like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning. 
DOMENICO Relax, you're perfectly safe where you are. (pause) You have any visits from your Signora Mason? 
FRANK (quiet) I wish. 
DOMENICO Never let them cuddle, Mr. Taylor. One cuddle and it all turns to merda. Good night. If you need anything, you have my number. 
Frank hangs up, shaking his head. 
In the restful silence he hears a DISTANT BANG. A gunshot? A door slam? Nervous, he gets up and goes to the door... 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Frank looks right and left. The corridor is empty and silent, lit by strip lights set on low. 
Just as he's about to close the door again, Frank notices that there is a label stuck there with his name on it, just above the room number. 
He struggles with the label for a few seconds, tearing it off. 
He sticks the label on the door to an empty room opposite. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Frank goes to the sink and splashes water on his face. Stares at himself for several moments, as he did in the bathroom at the Danieli. He's lost in thought. 
Then... 
He hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled along. Some footsteps approach. There are voices speaking an unfamiliar language, maybe Russian... 
Russian? 
Frank scrambles for his clothes. He fishes out Domenico's phone number from a pocket and races to the phone. Then freezes, listening:

Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air. 
SHREK Oh, my butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit! 
Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail. 
SHREK Oh. (WHISTLE) Hey you. Come here! 
A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek. 
SHREK What's your name? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 10. 
FIDDLESWORTH Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir. 
SHREK Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect. 
INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The announcer introduces Shrek and Fiona. 
MASTER OF CEREMONIES Ladies and gentlemen, Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek! 
The audience claps. The curtain starts to open. Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt. 
SHREK You've done it. Oh, a little over to the left, yeah. That's great. 
FIONA Uh Shrek? 
Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention. 
SHREK Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it! Oh that's good! 
FIONA Shrek... 
SHREK Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You got it. You're on it. That's great! 
FIONA SHREK! 
Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both freeze. Shrek laughs nervously. 
Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming. 
DONKEY Ow!! My eye! My eye! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 11. 
As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd. 
WOMAN What are you doing? 
The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the vase which causes Fiona to fall over. 
Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona. 
SHREK Fiona! 
He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole, trapping him. 
FIDDLESWORTH Uhhh... (WIMPER) 
Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor. 
SHREK Are you okay? 
FIONA Yeah. I'm fine. 
Fiona's eyes suddenly widen. 
Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter carrying flaming skewers. 
FIDDLESWORTH Ahhhh! 
The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of the skewers out and takes a bite. 
DONKEY Oh! Shrimp! My favorite. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 12. 
The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half. 
The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide. 
CRASH! BANG! 
CUT TO BLACK: 
INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The door to Fiona's room flies open. 
SHREK That's it! We're leaving! 
Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.

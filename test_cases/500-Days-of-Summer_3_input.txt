TOM Let's get breakfast. 
SUMMER Now? 
TOM Pancakes? 
Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is history. 
FADE UP: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays OVER: 
1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable. 
LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other. 
2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY 
Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline. 
2. INT LIBRARY - DAY 
Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design. 
3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY 
Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise. 
4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY 
Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him. 
6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also crossed off. 
5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY 
Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge. 
8. EXT PARK - DAY 
Tom jogs. A little faster this time. 
9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost in thought. 
Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness. 
9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY 
On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window. Thinking. 
On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is lifted. And she's a bride. 
END MUSIC. 
EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY 
Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago. 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice. 
SUMMER (V.O.) Hey. 
Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to do. 
SUMMER (re: suit) Where you coming from? 
TOM What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there? 
SUMMER Awhile. 
Tom finds it hard to look at her. 
SUMMER I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here. 
The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty. 
TOM So... I should probably say congratulations.

KURT You're a pawn. And I think it's time you get off the board bro. 
Troy takes this in. 
KURT (CONT'D) Here's the deal. Every year we throw a party. The point is to mock the self important and moronic entities of the campus. The way to get staffed is to write an invite for the party. (MORE) 
KURT (CONT'D) Our invites are legendary, we make Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs every year. If your invite is the one that goes out, you're guaranteed a spot on the staff. The runners up are voted on by the rest of us. 
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance. 
45A   LIVING ROOM                                                 45A 
Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. She's in her element with these boys at her feet. 
COCO I just think having good hair and carrying on with a degree of sophistication doesn't make me a traitor to the race. 
MITCH Want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch? 
GORDON                           COCO Absolutely not.                 No one called you that. 
KITCHEN 
Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach... 
TROY Okay. And what's this year's theme? 
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively. 
KURT Still working on that... 
TROY The party's a couple weeks away. 
GORDON Yo Kurt. I want you to meet someone. 
COCO You guys got a party coming up? 
Coco smiles at Kurt, before flicking her eyes over Troy. 
46   INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              46 
Sungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam's apartment as the party winds down. 
SUNGMI Hey, about the rally. You could still get the permit anyway Sam and go against the board. Most people consider that political suicide though. 
REGGIE We got to rally Sam. Time is now. 
SAM Use your head Reggie. You think a rally is going to change things? 
REGGIE It'll do a hell of a lot more than a radio show or views on Youtube. 
Everyone gets quiet. Sungmi takes this time to exit. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Look, we got power Sam and it's time we used it. We earned it. 
SAM We? I didn't see you running for shit Reggie. 
The Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. Sam waits a beat and rolls her eyes. 
47   EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT                      47 
Sam walks after Reggie. 
REGGIE Tired. 
SAM Don't "one word" me. 
REGGIE Why you got to snap at me all the time? I'm around you like twenty four seven. Like your lap dog. I don't even usually get down like that with no red bone chicks man. 
SAM Don't call me that. 
REGGIE Come on, I thought your ass was Puerto Rican when I met you. 
Sam turns to go. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Oh so you can dish it out but you can't take it? 
SAM I'm taking my ass home. 
REGGIE Come on Sam. You know how I feel about you.

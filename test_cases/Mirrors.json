Tell no one.\" \nOrph\u00e9e, Jean Cocteau \n1    OMITTED                                                         1 \n1A   INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION                             1A \nA subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in Harlem. \nA man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform. \nHe turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed. \nDesperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside. \n1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1B \nThe place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt - \nThe neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark. \nThe man checks each stall one at a time. \nHis face lights up as he looks inside the last one- \nA SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL THROUGH. \nHe steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight. After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover- \nA wall of bricks. \nPanic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside. \nA FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard. \nHe quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen. \nSilence. \nHis heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound. The place is empty. \nThe room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights. \nHe moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror. His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist portrait. \n(CONTINUED) \n1B   CONTINUED:                                                       1B \nMAN I'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying to get away... \nHe talks to his own reflection in the mirror- \nMAN (CONT'D) No, please don't... \nHe approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too frantically- \nA piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground. \nImmediately, he bends down to pick it up but- \nHIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE, WATCHING HIM. \nLooking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent. A separate being... \nTerrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double. \nThe pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade. \nHis eyes turn cold with fear when- \nHIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT! \nIN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD. \nVoid of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end. \nIn reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED. \nCUT TO: \n1C   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                              1C \nOPENING CREDITS ON- \nAll the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan- \nThey shake hands. \nLARRY You look awful. \nBEN Thanks Larry. \nLARRY You know, you should sleep at night. Come in... \nBen follows him into the office. \n9   INT. DAY - LARRY'S' OFFICE                                    9 \nLarry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files that have been dropped off on his desk- \nLARRY So did you find an apartment yet? \nBEN No, not yet. \nLARRY You need a place to stay? \nBEN No, I'm staying at my sister's, in Queens. \nLARRY I didn't know you had a sister. What does she do? \nBEN She's a bartender. \nLARRY That's not too good for you! Anyway, you know you are always welcome to stay at our house. \nLarry looks up at Ben, slightly uneasy- \n(CONTINUED) \n9   CONTINUED:                                                    9 \nLARRY (CONT'D) I ran into Amy the other day. How are things going between the two of you? \nBen remains silent. He obviously doesn't want to get into that subject. \nLARRY (CONT'D) So, why did you want to see me Ben? \nBEN You know what I want. I'm ready to come back, I'm feeling much better now. \nLARRY Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on the force. Nobody in the squad wants you around right now. I'm sorry but I have to be honest with you. You understand, right? \nBEN Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready. \nLARRY If it was up to me, I would bring you back tomorrow, but I'm not the only one who decides. Listen, I think I've got something else for you. I know a guy at the Mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores. \nBEN What?! Come on Larry, a security guard job... I'm not ready to retire yet! \nLARRY Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I know you're over qualified for that position but it's a good opportunity for you for the time being...until the situation here quiets down. Also the money is not that bad. \nBen is having a hard time to contain his anger. \nLARRY (CONT'D) You need the money, Ben. You're in the middle of a divorce and you've got child support to cover. If you want to see your kids, you've got to get a job, any job. \nDeep inside, Ben knows Larry's right. \n(CONTINUED) \n9    CONTINUED: (2)                                                 9 \nLARRY (CONT'D) Do you know the Mayflower on West 38th Street? \nBEN I do. The one that burned down? \nLARRY Yes, their night watchman hasn't shown up for work in several days. They need someone right away. Take it, relax, and we will talk about your situation again in a couple months. \nBEN Yeah, in a couple months... I gave everything for the NYPD. I almost died out there. Everyone seems to have forgotten that. \nLARRY I didn't. \nCUT TO: \n10   INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     10 \nWe discover a whole different world- \nIn the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand, describe the corpses. \nWe are a world away from the Hollywood clich\u00e9s of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story... \nAmidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone. \nAmy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates for a moment and doesn't answer the call. \nAmy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder. \n11   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                            11 \nDozens of pigeons fly away as the above ground subway passes by. \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                     11 \nBEN Fuck... \nA few inches of water cover the basement floor. One of the water pipes must have burst due to the cold. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                                       36 \nThe light flickers back for a moment, revealing before him-        the narrow subterranean corridors of the department store. \nAlong a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the switches. Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the darkness. \nAS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY, UP ALONG THE STAIRS, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR, IT ACCELERATES AND STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR- \nIN THE REFLECTION, WE SEE THE BASEMENT DOOR SHUT... \nFADE TO BLACK \n37   EXT. DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET                                       37 \nIt's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines the trees and houses. \nOn the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year old DAISY are building a snowman. \nMICHAEL Why did they say on TV that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead? Why did they lie? \nDAISY Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael. It happens... \nMICHAEL Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only little children do. \nSlightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman. \nDaisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight of her father's car approaching- \nDAISY Daddy! \nMichael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile, with a big wrapped package in his arms. \nThe children abandon their snowman and rush towards their father. Ben takes Michael into his arms- \nMICHAEL (pointing to the wrapped present) What is that? \n(CONTINUED) \n37   CONTINUED:                                                     37 \nBEN Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree. \nMICHAEL Is it for me? \nBEN Maybe... (to his daughter) Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present? \nMichael nods. \nDAISY No! Yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece. \nMICHAEL Not true! \nDAISY Yes it's true! \nMICHAEL No, it's not true... She's lying Daddy. I've been a very good boy, I promise. \nThey enter the house. \nBEN Is mom back? \nDAISY Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from school today. \n38   INT. DAY - HOUSE - CONTINUITY                                  38 \nIn the kitchen, ROSA, the nanny, is rinsing the dishes from the afternoon snack- \nBEN Hello Rosa! \nROSA Hello Se\u00f1or Carson. How are you? \nBEN I'm good, very good... What time will Amy be back? \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 \nROSA Not before six, Sir... \nBEN OK, I'll wait for her. \nROSA Do you want me to fix you a snack? \nBEN No, thank you. I'll be fine. \nBen takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room. He hands over the present to his son. \nDaisy is sitting in the armchair, holding her cat, TIGER, in her arms. \nBEN (CONT'D) Happy birthday, Michael. \nBen exits the room. Amy is left alone- \nThrough the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into his car. \nWhen she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. She smiles, and quickly comes to dry them. \nMICHAEL Mom? \nAMY Yes, honey. \nMICHAEL Is Daddy coming back to live with us? \nShe smiles gently. \nAMY I don't know sweetheart. I don't know. \n43   INT. DAY - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER                        43 \nThe beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of water flooding the basement corridor. Since yesterday, the water level has continued to rise. \nThe outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the staircase leading to the ground floor- \nBEN I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store... It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold... \nLORENZO I'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it. \n44   INT. NIGHT- SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                            44 \nOn the gas stove, a kettle is whistling. \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:                                                     44 \nBen rummages through the cupboards and the drawers. He finds some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky... \nHe grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant coffee. \nIn the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time for his rounds. \n45   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL                            45 \nThrough the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben walking through the store. \nSince the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural manifestation. \nThe shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are all disturbing and unsettling. \nEven what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble columns seems alive in the dark. \nAs he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror- \nAT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. \nHow is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS... \nBen glances back at the reflection in the mirror- \nThe vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben decides to check it out for himself... \nBen wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE \"FLASHBACK\"- \nWe follow him in the mirror- \nBen has left the night behind and enters the \"daytime\" department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled. \nBen continues his journey into the past. \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 \nThe customers jostle one another while shopping during a big sale. Children run wild in the aisles. Women fight over articles of clothing. \nBen stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes, a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor- \nHe bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE. Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor of the department store. \nBen turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A ZIPPO- \nThe lighter falls to the floor in slow motion. \nThe liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE- \nEVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING. \nFrightened, Ben steps back- \nThe flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death- \nHORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH. FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE. \nIn the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN? \nBen has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches fire. \nSensing something wrong, Ben turns around. \nIn the silence he faces his infinite reflections, all of them identical- OR ALMOST... \nTaking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates' faces bearing an expression slightly different from the others'. A SUBTLE GRIN. \n(CONTINUED) \n54    CONTINUED: (2)                                                 54 \nKnowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the \"rebel duplicate\" turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze- \nWe can hardly recognize Ben's image. \nThe duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other reflections and slowly walks towards Ben. \nInstinctively, Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the vision disappear. \nWhen he opens up his eyes again- \nHIS EVIL DOUBLE RUSHES TOWARDS HIM- \nBen steps back terrified. \nCUT TO: \n55    INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     55 \nUnder the dazzling neon light of the NYPD coroner's premises, Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to the police inspectors in charge of the investigation. \nShe is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her urgently. Amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves, and exits the autopsy room. \nWe follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the hospital. \nThe atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive activity of this particular department. There is no doubt- we are in New York City. \n55A   CORONER'S OFFICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                           55A \nAmy comes to the reception desk. Ben, who clearly hasn't slept since the night before, is pacing back and forth. \nAMY Are you OK? What's happening? What are you doing here? \nBEN Amy, I need you to do me a favor... \n(CONTINUED) \n55A   CONTINUED:                                                   55A \nAMY Listen, I am in the middle of work, I don't really have time now. \nBEN I need your help... It won't take more than twenty minutes. Please, Amy? \nFrom his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license. He shows it to her- \nBEN (CONT'D) You picked up this guy yesterday morning... I need to take a look at him. It's very important. \nAMY Why do you want to see him? \nBEN He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before I replaced him. \nAMY Where did you get his driver's license? \nBEN I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he died... \nAMY You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore. \nBEN He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower... I think he was trying to tell me something... I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy... I need to figure this out. \n56    INT. DAY - MORGUE                                              56 \nThe refrigerated compartment bays, containing the corpses, are aligned along the basement walls. \nA young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the morgue. As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register, in search of a name. \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                      56 \nYOUNG DOCTOR Gary Lewis... Gary Lewis... Oh, there he is, 58B... He slashed his throat... \nAMY (to Ben) There you go... There's your answer. Your man committed suicide. \nBEN You know a lot of people who cut their own throats? \nYOUNG DOCTOR (interrupting) Well, all I know is that the cops are still investigating this one. That's why we still have the body. People can be very creative when it comes to suicide. I'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen. \nThe young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet- \nYOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D) Gary Lewis... \nHe lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body- \nGary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His flesh has started to decompose and putrefy. \nBen stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful information... \nAMY (irritated) OK... This is way over my head. I don't have time for your barfly theories. \nBen realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her. Not today. \nBEN Thanks for your help... \nHe's on his way out, when she holds him back- \nAMY You should go home and get some rest. This guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore. It happens to thousands of people, you know... \nCUT TO: \n58   INT. DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - BATHROOM                           58 \nThe steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet. \nBen grabs a towel and steps out of the shower. \nHe watches his blurry reflection. With his finger, on the surface of the fogged mirror, he writes- \nESSEKER \nHe contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying to interpret their meaning. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 \nIn the end, he wipes off the mirror with his hand, erasing the word. \nAngela is standing behind him in the door opening- \nANGELA I'm off... Amy called me today, she's worried about you. What's happening, Ben? \nBEN Please, not you... \nANGELA I'm your sister, you can talk to me. Is it your new job? That place, the Mayflower, has bad vibes. It's getting under your skin. Just think about what I told you... \nBEN I made a deal, Angie... I can't just walk out on them like that. I need this job, I need the money. I'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life! \nANGELA You won't have any trouble finding another one. A daytime job, a regular job... \nWhile she's talking, we see the scene from another point of view- from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO THEM. \nAngela leaves the bathroom. Ben brushes his teeth. He leans over to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up- \nIT IS NOT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, BUT GARY LEWIS WHO SLASHES HIS THROAT FROM END TO END WITH A SHARP PIECE OF MIRROR- \nBen steps back and loses his balance, knocking down a shelf. Angela rushes into the bathroom- \nANGELA (CONT'D) What happened Ben? Are you all right? \nHe refuses her help. \nBEN LEAVE ME ALONE... \nBen gets to his feet and looks into the mirror. His reflection is back. Everything looks normal but- \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 58 \nWHEN HE TURNS TO EXIT THE BATHROOM, HIS REFLECTION STAYS STILL, WATCHING HIM... \nCUT TO: \n59   EXT. DAY- GARY LEWIS' BUILDING                                 59 \nThe sun sets behind the Harlem skyline. \nBen's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift. \nHe presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady answers- \nBEN Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My name is Ben Carson. I worked with Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes? \nSilence. \nBEN (CONT'D) Mrs. Lewis ? \nMRS. LEWIS ...5th floor, apartment 3B... \nThe entrance door of the building opens. \nCUT TO: \n60   INT. DAY- MRS. LEWIS' APARTMENT                                60 \nMRS. LEWIS is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she used to share with her grandson. \nWe sense that she is distraught by Gary's death. \nMRS. LEWIS ...My Gary hadn't slept at home for three weeks. At first I figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so I didn't worry much about it... It's terrible. The policeman told me that he was living in the streets... They found his body in the subway. Why? He had everything he needed here. Every morning I would have his breakfast ready when he'd come home from work. \n(CONTINUED) \n61A   INT. NIGHT - LADIES' DEPARTMENT DRESSING ROOMS                61A \nThe screams come closer. Ben passes the counters and enters the dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire. \nThe woman must be in here, hiding somewhere. \n(CONTINUED) \n61A   CONTINUED:                                                  61A \nBEN I'm here Ma'am... \nShort of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his flashlight. \nThe woman seems to have vanished. \nBEN (CONT'D) Ma'am? I'm right he... \nANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around- \nNo one there. \nAbout to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms- \nA BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN! \nBen runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM! \nBen stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened inside. \nBen unhooks the mirror. \nIt is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down the wall. \nInch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor. \nHe reaches the last dressing room- \nThrough the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior of the cubicle. \nIn the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of the body... \nWith his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover. He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing- \nA NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH PAIN. DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REAL FLAMES, HER SKIN AND FLESH ARE ROASTING, AS IF SHE WERE BURNING ALIVE FROM THE INSIDE OUT! \nCUT TO: \nBLACK SCREEN \n(CONTINUED) \n61A   CONTINUED: (2)                                               61A \nCHILD'S VOICE O.S. Mom! Mom! Mom! \n62    INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                  62 \nWe are in the darkness of Daisy and Michael's bedroom. Michael is terrified and cries out for his mother- \nMICHAEL Mom! Mom! \nAmy swings the door open and turns on the light. \nAMY What is it Michael? \nThe little boy throws himself into his mother's arms. Daisy wakes up. \nAMY (CONT'D) What is it? Did you have a bad dream? \nMICHAEL There's a lady screaming... \nAMY Where Michael? \nMichael points to the mirror wall facing the bunk beds. \nMICHAEL There... In the mirror... \nAMY No, Michael... Look, there's nothing there. \nMICHAEL I saw her mom. I swear I did. \nAMY It was just a nightmare. It's late, you have to go back to sleep. I'll turn on the night-light, if you want. \nAmy tucks him into bed and kisses him. Before leaving the room she plugs in the night-light. \nDAISY Mom, can you leave the door open? \nAMY Sure sweetheart... OK, you two go to sleep now. \n(CONTINUED) \n62   CONTINUED:                                                     62 \nAmy leaves the room. \nThe camera flashes illuminate the crime scene. \nAngela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is entirely flooded. \nTwo men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep the intrusive neighbors away. \nA detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police, after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains how \"it was raining blood into her living room\"... \nAmongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find Larry. He is in charge of the case. \nLeaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black hair, floating in the murky water. \nLarry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub. \nThe water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's naked corpse. \nWith the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering Angela's face- \n(CONTINUED) \n66   CONTINUED:                                                      66 \nTaken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of this JAW-LESS FACE. \nLarry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention- \nHe comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks. \nStrange. \nA DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub. \nA police inspector in the next room, calls out to him- \nPOLICE INSPECTOR O.S. Larry? Take a look at this... \nLARRY What is it? \nPOLICE INSPECTOR O.S. Come take a look for yourself. \nLarry exits the bathroom. The police inspector in the living room holds a picture frame in his hands. He turns towards Larry- \nPOLICE INSPECTOR Look... Isn't Ben Carson in the picture? \nCUT TO: \n67   INT. DAY - POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM                    67 \nStill wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the interrogation rooms of the police station. His haggard face expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him distraught. \nHe fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands. \nThe classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his reflection. \nBen knows that he is being watched. \nBehind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him. Larry is standing next to her. \nLARRY The water has obliterated most of the marks. No trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED:                                                     67 LARRY (CONT'D) The person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment, or otherwise it was somebody she knew... \nAMY He would never have laid a finger on her. When their father died, Ben took care of his sister. Angela meant the world to him. \nLARRY Listen, so far, his statement is pretty consistent with the facts... We checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning. The daytime security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli, confirms he came on after Ben's shift at seven a.m. The only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere... Did he mention anything about it to you? \nAMY No, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong point... (she smiles) I only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's. What are you going to do with him? \nLARRY I figure we'll let him go. At this point we haven't got any real reason to keep him here. And, I think he's had his share for the day. \nAMY You know what's gonna happen if you let him go. He won't stop here. I know him, he won't stop until he finds who did this to her. \nLARRY Listen, where we stand now, we got nothing, not a single clue. I'm sure he can help us. \nAMY What kind of friend are you? You are using him. He's not a cop anymore. \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   67 \nLARRY He's still the best one I know, even if he's one of the suspects. \nAmy comes closer to the two-way mirror. She looks at her ex- husband on the other side. He seems overcome with grief and confusion. She can see the distress in his eyes. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Try to keep an eye on him. \nCUT TO: \n68   EXT.

NIGHT -QUEENS APARTMENT                                       72 \nBack in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep. On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings, articles and photographs that Gary sent him. \nEach and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to neutralize the reflective surfaces. \nWith the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the middle of a heated conversation- \nBEN ...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo... Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name... No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back? Ok... \nBen hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of Gary's investigative research. \nAll the articles date back approximately to the same period and are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years ago. \nBut not a hint of Esseker. \nBen studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story together- \n\" Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded \" \n\"   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered...\" \n\" ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... \" \n\" ...the throat slit open... \" \n\" Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... \" \n(CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED:                                                     72 \n\" The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly denies the accusation of murdering his family... \" \n\" Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty- The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses. He started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the death of his wife and three daughters. \" \nBen observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind, surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with him. \nAs he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the window- \nWhat if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his family? Or what if the mirrors would do it? \nThe phone rings- \nBEN (CONT'D) Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing under that name? Shit, shit, shit, shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence Berry... \nBen holds on the line, for a moment. \nBEN (CONT'D) ...Got anything? Great...No, I already know all that. Is he still alive? No... Can you find out where he was committed before his death? Wait, I'm writing it down... \nBen sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a piece of paper. \nBEN (CONT'D) ...Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention Center... Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks. \nHe hangs up the phone. Under the blanket, next to him, he spots the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night. \nThe pain is too strong. He cannot hold back his tears anymore and starts crying. \nCUT TO: \n73   INT.

His sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice. Amy, shaking a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state- \nAMY Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl? \nThe little boy does not answer. \nAMY (CONT'D) Michael? \nMICHAEL In the chocolate... \nAMY ...In the chocolate, please, mom... \nMICHAEL (repeating after her) ...Please, mom. \nShe pours the cereal in his hot chocolate. \nDAISY Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat that? \nAMY Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school. \nMichael begins to eat his breakfast, his gaze still fixed on the weatherman's forecast on TV.

A grainy picture appears on the screen- \nWe discover TERRENCE BERRY, sitting behind a desk. His hands are cuffed. Facing him, DR.

He keeps his face down, never looking into the camera. \nDESPITE HAVING SURVIVED THE FIRE, TERRENCE'S FACE IS NONETHELESS DISFIGURED BY THIRD DEGREE BURNS. HE NO LONGER HAS FACIAL FEATURES, AND HE STRUGGLES WITH HIS SPEECH. \nDR. MORRIS (CONT'D) Why did you set the department store on fire? \nTERRENCE In order to... to destroy the mirrors. Only fire can destroy a mirror, isn't that right, Doctor? \nDR. MORRIS What made you think you absolutely had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence? \nTerrence remains silent. Dr. Morris repeats his question- \nDR. MORRIS (CONT'D) What made you want to destroy those mirrors, Terrence? \nTERRENCE They killed Helen and my three little girls... \nDR. MORRIS For what reason? Why would mirrors want to kill your family? \nTERRENCE Because I didn't... \nTerrence breaks out in tears. \nDR.

MORRIS (CONT'D) Who is Esseker, Terrence? \nSuddenly, Terrence's behavior shifts to another extreme. He stands up, and flying into a rage, he becomes brutal and hysterical- \nTERRENCE I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS! I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS, I DON'T KNOW!! \nTerrence becomes uncontrollable. He wrecks the folders lying on the desk and throws himself, head first, against a wall mirror that shatters to pieces. \nCUT TO: \n77   EXT.

DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE -   CONTINUITY                       78 \nHe is beside himself. After seeing the video footage on Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family- \nBefore the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor. He is removing the mirrors from each and every room. \nHe tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far end of the hallway, and removes some from Amy's room... \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:                                                      78 \nRosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under her protective arms. Amy is not back yet. \nThe only mirror left that Ben cannot remove, is the one in the children's room. \nHe rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of old paint. He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in order to neutralize its reflection. \nThe little boy does as his mother says.      He gets up and dashes out of the room. \nAmy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her balance- \nMICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A SQUATTING POSITION! \nHE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE. \nAmy attempts to speak but can't- \nThe mirror image of her son remains silent. \nAmy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind the boy, she discovers- \nHER MIRROR IMAGE IS THERE TOO, BEARING THE SAME FORCED GRIN... \nCUT TO: \n89   INT.

Something in the mirrors. \nBEN Where are Daisy and Michael? Are the kids all right? \nAMY O.S. They're with me... They're right here with me. Come over, please! \nBEN Get out of the house.

We can go to my mother's or to a hotel... \nBEN Anyplace is gonna have mirrors or windows... Anything you can see your self in is dangerous. We have to make the house safe. The only way is to cover all the reflections. If we keep them in the dark we can avoid them. We need paint, we need tape... \nCUT TO : \n93   INT.

In the face of this hardship, all the arguments seem far away. We can feel a connection between the two of them. \nThe windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely with newspaper and tape. \nEvery inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the TV- screen and the shiny taps, have been \"neutralized\" with strips of masking tape... \nIN NO TIME, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SURFACE CAPABLE OF REFLECTING LIGHT LEFT IN THE HOUSE. \nCUT TO : \n94   EXT.

(to Ben) What can I do for you sir? \nBEN I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker. \nThe young man looks at Ben questioningly. Apparently he has never heard the name before. \nJIMMY (to his mother inside) There's a man who's looking for... (back to Ben) You said Anna? (Ben confirms) Anna Esseker, Mom! \nJimmy's mother, in her fifties, an obese woman who has trouble moving around- shows up in the opening of the door - \nJIMMY'S MOTHER What is it you want with Anna Esseker? \nShe catches him unaware.

DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT                                101 \nWe are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old, Anna's elder brother. \nRobert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him- \nROBERT You know, up to this day, the visions of Anna's fits still haunt me at night. \nThey walk through the basement towards an old wooden door. \nROBERT (CONT'D) I helped my father fix up this part of the basement, especially for her- \nThe old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door swings open, revealing- \nROBERT (CONT'D) Her fits were too violent. My mother couldn't take her screams anymore. \nWhat's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEAST. \nAs he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from that time come back to him- \nAnna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and legs. \n(CONTINUED) \n101   CONTINUED:                                                 101 \nROBERT (CONT'D) We had every priest, doctor, healer, coming from all over the state, one after the other. But no one could help her. \nBen comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering. \nROBERT (CONT'D) Finally, Dr. Kane from New York answered my parents' cry for help. He rejected the idea of demonic possession, said he didn't believe in it. He was convinced that Anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder. He wanted Anna under his care, at St. John's. My parents were very poor, but he agreed to cover all the hospital costs... In less than five months, Dr. Kane had cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She was her old self again. A real miracle of science. \nBEN And after the hospital? \nROBERT You don't know? She died there with all of Kane's other patients. \nBen takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to Robert. \nBEN Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. Kane changed the records to make her disappear. \nROBERT You're not a journalist, are you? What do you want? \nBEN I want to know. After St. John's, where did she go? \nRobert stares at Ben, unsure of saying what he's about to reveal to this perfect stranger- \nROBERT Anna came back to live with us for a while... \n(CONTINUED) \n101   CONTINUED: (2)                                             101 \nBEN For a while? \nRobert lowers his eyes. \nBEN (CONT'D) And after? Why did she leave? \nROBERT Because... Because strange things started to happen in the house... \nBEN With Anna? \nROBERT No, not with Anna... \nThe old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details. The memories are too painful. \nBEN With the mirrors? \nRobert stiffens, eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know? \nBEN (CONT'D) Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find your sister. It's very important. It's a matter of life and death. \nSISTER ANNA St. John's closed down in 1952. Who are you? \nBen sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna. \nBEN My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St. John's Hospital. \nSISTER ANNA What is it you want Mr. Carson? \nBEN I need your help. \nSISTER ANNA My help? I don't quite see how I could possibly be of any help. \nBEN My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you... \nFor a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the screen. She has understood... \nBEN (CONT'D) If you don't help me I may lose the only thing that matters to me. \nSISTER ANNA I cannot leave the precincts. It's impossible. \nBEN Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you? \nSister Anna remains silent- \nBEN (CONT'D) I must know, Sister. \nSISTER ANNA It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them. The mirrors are merely windows on our world... \n(CONTINUED) \n107A CONTINUED: (2)                                          107A \nBEN A window... For what? For whom? \nANNA At the time that I was at St. John's, Dr. Kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image. I spent the darkest days of my life in that room. On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead. Since that day, I have never had another fit. But deep down inside I've always known the truth. \nBEN What truth? \nANNA There is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, Mr. Carson. And whatever it was, it entered the mirror. \nWe can feel the emotion in her voice. \nANNA (CONT'D) I thought that after fifty years, this would have all gone away. They would have disappeared from the mirrors. I didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I agree to go with you and return to that place, I will make it possible for them to cross the threshold back into the real world. \nEverything is now making sense for Ben- \nBEN It entered with you and they need you to get out. \nANNA The consequences of such an act, Mr. Carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now. I'm going to pray for you and your family. That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson. God bless you... \nShe stands to leave. \n(CONTINUED) \n107A CONTINUED: (3)                                               107A \nBEN Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me... Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago... My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look- \nFrom his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael, as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna to look at it. \nBEN (CONT'D) My wife and two children. They're all I've got. They're innocent... Please. \nAnna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves. \nBEN (CONT'D) I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE. WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR TIME! \nAnna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance. \nBen failed. He's desperate and lost. He has a hard time containing his anger. \n105   EXT. DAY - MONASTERY                                         105 \nOn the horizon, a red sun sets behind the treetops. It's almost nightfall. \nThe bells from the monastery begin to toll. \nThe cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle of rain water. \nFrustrated, Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number on his cell phone - \n106   EXT.

NIGHT - HALLWAY                                             108 \nIn the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to Amy's bedroom is the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten. \nIn the distorted reflection, we see Michael's silhouette approaching.

You know very well you are not allowed to play with that, don't you? \nMichael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool. \nAMY (CONT'D) That's a good boy, now give me the knife... \nInstead of obeying, Michael runs off and disappears into another room on the first floor. \nAMY (CONT'D) MICHAEL ! \nAmy rushes after him. \n118   INT.

As Narcissus did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of the water that covers the wooden floor. \nAMY Michael ? \nHypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his mother's call. \nAmy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him. \nAMY (CONT'D) Michael... Michael, look at me... I'm right here. \nMichael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in the surface of the water. \nAmy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his reflection... \nShe lays her hand on his shoulder. \nThis time Michael reacts and turns towards her. \nBefore he can utter a single word- \nTHE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S WRISTS. MICHAEL'S REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE. MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR. \nAmy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of water covering the floor.

Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall. \nCUT TO : \nWith his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore- Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens. \nHe slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was \"Anna\"... \nCrouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge. Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The creature thrusts itself against him- \nTHE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance. \nIn a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES \"ANNA\" ON THE BROKEN GAS PIPE! \nIN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER STOMACH BUT- \nDespite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the trap. \nBen moves away, keeping an eye on \"Anna\". He takes his gun and aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment. \nThe silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark. \nBen stands by- \nThe demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires- \nTHE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. \"ANNA\" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

The brick walls begin to fall apart. \nA part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in. \nBen gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs. \nTotally burnt, flesh charred, \"Anna\" is enraged by her prey's resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben. \nBehind them, one after the other, sections of the walls collapse. \nBen runs as fast as he can. \n\"Anna\" is coming closer to him, when suddenly - \nJUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE. \nBen narrowly escaped the collapse.

Intrigued, he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward- \nA HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE. \nHe touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off, unsuccessfully.

He comes closer and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The humidity has pearled into droplets. \nHe has found the source of the leak. \nHis hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which the tubing was embedded. \nBen hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were another room on the other side of the wall. \nHe pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the gaping black hole that he has just left behind. \nBen peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot make out what is on the other side. \nHe makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for him to crawl through- \nON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS MIRRORS. \nOne of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door. \nHe enters. \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:                                                      50 \nHis image is reflected in all directions and from infinite angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room- \nALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING IN THE CORNER. \nIt's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security guard's uniform. \nFrom where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name embroidered on the man's shoulder- \nIT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN! \nBEN Gary? \nThe silhouette remains still. \nBEN (CONT'D) Gary? \nBen comes a bit closer. \nHis gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but- \nHE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR, INSIDE! \nBen steps back, terrified. \nHe doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon. \nBen gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror- \nKnock, knock, knock... \nHe hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side- \nNo reaction. Ben strikes the mirror harder. \nKnock, knock, knock... \nThe former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben, revealing his face little by little... \nCUT TO: \n51   INT.

Ben gets up from the couch- \nBEN Coming... \nBen opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package- \nDELIVERYMAN Mr. Carson? (Ben nods) Would you mind signing here, please? \n", "test2_true": "DELIVERYMAN (CONT'D) You have a nice day, Sir... \nBen shuts the door and examines the UPS box. He's not used to getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from- \nTHE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS... \nBen grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room table- \nA DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE. \nMore or less recent, all the articles relate to the department store and the fire that burned it down... Gary has meticulously cut them out and sent them to Ben. But why? \n52   EXT.

I never liked him too much, but poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that... \nBEN Did they mention the cause of death? \nLORENZO No... they wouldn't tell me. \nLorenzo hands him over the keys. \nLORENZO (CONT'D) Well, Ben? I better get going, Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home. Have a good night at work, Ben. Oh, and by the way, about that leak, they're sending someone over to work at it the beginning of next week. \nBEN Have a good night, Lorenzo. \nBen remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment, his gaze fixed at the department store- \nTHE WALLET, THE DREAM, AND NOW, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, THE NEWS OF GARY'S DEATH... ALL THESE STRANGE COINCIDENCES AROUND HIS PREDECESSOR HAVE AWOKEN HIS CURIOSITY AND DOUBT. BEN WANTS TO KNOW... \n53   INT.

What is happening to me? \nThe moisture has pearled into droplets. Slowly, his hand comes closer. The wall crumbles at the slightest touch... \nPushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster, just as he had done in his nightmare... \nHe hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the other side of the wall. It confirms the existence of a hidden room. \nBen begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a large enough opening to access the other side- \nHe inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing- \nTHE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM, SURROUNDED BY THE MIRRORING WALLS. \nHe enters. His image is reflected in all directions and multiplied into infinity. His dream was foreboding. Everything is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of Gary Lewis- \nThe former watchman is not there but... \nALL OF A SUDDEN, BEHIND HIM, ONE OF BEN'S DUPLICATES IN THE INFINITE REFLECTION TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE HIM WITH AN ICE COLD GLARE... \n", "test2_id": 1987, "test3_input": "82   EXT/INT.

A thousand thoughts rush through his head, leaving him in an utter state of confusion. He doesn't know what to do nor what to think anymore. \nBen reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number- \nBEN Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to need your help again- \nLARRY (O.S.) Come on, Ben... For Christ's sake! What are you doing? \nBEN Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store. St. John's Hospital. Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down? \nLARRY (O.S.) How am I supposed to know that?! \nBEN Go to the city hall archives... They must have something considering it was a public hospital. \nLARRY (O.S.) I've got others things to do. I can't go to City Hall today. I've - \nBEN Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients. Please. \nLARRY (O.S.) Ben, for god's sake, what are you trying to prove? \nBEN Please, do it for me. \nLARRY (O.S.) You know you're a real pain in the ass. \n(CONTINUED) \n82   CONTINUED:                                                      82 \nBEN Talk to you later. \nBen hangs up. \nHe glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT! \nStartled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision. \nTwo other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash. \nHe stops along the edge of the road. \nBen closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear- view mirror again- \nANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze. \nBen flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS... \nBen is alone and lost. \nBEN (CONT'D) What have I done? I don't understand... What have I done? \nInsert on what is written on the side rear-view mirror- \n\"OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR\" \n83   EXT. NIGHT -MANHATTAN STREET - NYPD POLICE STATION              83 \nUnder the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in front of the police station. \nA bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an adjacent street. Ben is waiting inside. \nA man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the vehicle. It's LARRY- \nThe rainwater drips down his raincoat. Under his arm he holds a file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag. \nLARRY This ought to make you happy... (handing him the file) Anna Esseker... \n(CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:                                                     83 \nBen nervously tears open the plastic wrapping- \nLARRY (CONT'D) I wasn't quite sure what you needed, so I got all of her medical records. \nBEN Perfect, Larry. That's perfect. \nBen skims through the pages. He cannot believe that he has finally discovered who Esseker is... \nLARRY Everyone's real edgy up there. You're still a fuckin' murder suspect. People are wondering why I let you out. You have to tell me more. What does the history of the Mayflower have to do with the death of your sister? \nBEN I don't know exactly. I can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when I took the job over there. Nothing makes any sense to me either but I have to follow my instinct. \nLarry notices the broken rear-view mirror- \nLARRY What happened? Did you have an accident? \nBen is too absorbed in the records. He doesn't answer. \nBEN Anna Esseker... Where did you find her files? Did you go to City Hall? \nLARRY No, you were wrong about that, they had nothing. All the medical records from St. John's Hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases. \nBen squints at him. \n", "test3_true": "Ben freezes- \n(CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 83 \nBEN What? \nLARRY When the nurses went on their rounds, first thing on the morning of October 6th, they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered in the main room. All of them were dead, including the girl. Apparently, they had killed one another... A slaughter house... After that they shut down the place. Nobody ever found out what really happened. \nBEN What about the doctor? Dr. Kane? \nLARRY He was arrested. They found him dead on the first day of his hearing. He had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror! \nCUT TO: \n84   INT.

WHY? IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE... \nOn an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952, Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address. \nDr. Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - \"Despite her young age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n86   CONTINUED:                                                       86 \nHe shuffles through the first few pages of various administrative documents. \nHis eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she struggles like a wild animal. \nA high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben turns around- \nAnother loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in the apartment. \nBen rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the sheet hanging on the frame- \nA crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on Anna's file laying on the desk- \nHe goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents it to the mirror- \nKRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a reaction to the photograph... \nBEN You're still alive, aren't you? \nAll of a sudden, Ben realizes something. He runs back to the file on the table and goes through the documents again, one by one. \nHe stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks the date. \nBEN (CONT'D) You're wrong Larry, you're wrong... \nHis eyes light up- \nBEN (CONT'D) ...she left the hospital on the 4th. \nAccording to the document, Anna left two days before the massacre! \nCUT TO: \n87   INT. - DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                     87 \nThe next morning- \n(CONTINUED) \n87   CONTINUED:                                                        87 \nThrough the half-opened door at the end of the hallway, we see Daisy brushing her teeth before going to school.

Daisy, Michael? \nShe passes in front of the children's room and stops- INSIDE, MICHAEL IS TALKING TO SOMEBODY. Amy listens closely, but she can only hear Michael's voice. On the other side of the door, the little boy bursts out in laughter- \n88   INT.

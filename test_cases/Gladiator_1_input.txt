Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the steady clip-clop of horses on stone.  A lot of horses. 
He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street outside. 
A stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into position at his gates.  Proximo grabs his clothes -- 
EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT 
With cool military precision the Praetorians take up position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an unassailable line.  They quickly prepare their bows. 
Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that entrance as well. 
EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT 
Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is followed by hundreds more -- 
The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now -- shouting -- 
Proximo races to his panicked guards -- 
PROXIMO Release them!  Release them all! ARM THEM! 
The guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators as quickly as they can -- 
Not quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped inside -- 
The compound is soon a raging inferno -- 
Proximo releases Maximus and Juba -- 
PROXIMO Come -- 
MAXIMUS But -- 
PROXIMO If you want to live -- follow me -- 
VIBIUS (calling to them) Go, Spaniard!  We'll show these Roman dogs how gladiators fight! 
Proximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other gladiators arm themselves -- 
INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT 
Proximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a decaying cramped tunnel. 
PROXIMO All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed -- 
JUBA How did they know? 
MAXIMUS We were betrayed. 
JUBA (stops) I'll stay here.  In case they follow. 
Maximus stops as well. 
JUBA Go!  Bring us the army! 
Maximus nods. 
PROXIMO Quickly -- 
He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of tunnels -- 
EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance. 
It is not a battle, it is a slaughter. 
The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless rain of flaming arrows continues -- 
Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies reaching for the statue of Mars. 
INT.  COLOSSEUM - SUBTERRANEAN - NIGHT 
Proximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the Colosseum. 
PROXIMO (points) Down that corridor is the butchery -- the blood sloughs lead to the Tiber.  Gods watch over you. 
MAXIMUS You're not coming? 
PROXIMO They are killing my men! 
He races back into the tunnel. 
Maximus moves quickly down the corridor.  He can finally see...

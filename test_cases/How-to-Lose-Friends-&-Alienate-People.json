{"test1_input": "ALISON Morgan Freeman? \nSIDNEY No, in the headlock. \nALISON You had this laminated? \nSIDNEY Oh just give it... He snatches the photograph back, catching Alison's glass in the process. Her drink SPILLS over her notebook - soaking the page she has been writing. \nALISON Shit! \nSIDNEY It's okay. It's okay. I've got it. He tries to blot the page with a napkin, smearing the ink. \nALISON Just...just leave it! She examines the book, furious. \nSIDNEY Sorry. He tries to think of something to say. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) It's pronounced Gloucester by the way. \nALISON \n(ICY) Are you going to get off that seat? \nSIDNEY No. \nALISON \n(BEAT) Do you know the meaning of Karma? \nSIDNEY The curry? \nALISON (inscribing a circle in \nTHE AIR ) What goes around, comes around. The moment is approaching when you will pay the price for being an asshole. When my boyfriend gets here I'm going to put my pacifist leanings to one side and encourage him to take you outside and... Her cell-phone rings. She answers it. \nALISON (CONT'D) Hello? Hi, honey.(Beat) Oh. (Beat) no, no, it's...don't worry about it. I'll see you then. She hangs up, avoiding Sidney's gaze, embarrassed and annoyed. \nSIDNEY Boyfriend not coming? \nShe stares straight ahead, gathering her things. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) \n(CONCILIATORY) Listen, I'm sorry. Do you think...? She turns to him. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Do you think I could have his drink? Alison gives him a cold smile, controlling her temper. She spots a heavily made-up WOMAN walking past. \nALISON Bobbie? \nWOMAN Hey! \nALISON You want a seat? I'm just leaving. \nWOMAN Thanks. The Woman takes Alison's place at the bar. \nSIDNEY (to the newcomer) Hello. He slides the PHOTOGRAPH over to her. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood. Alison gives a small smile and leaves. \n30 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 30 \nSidney and the Woman dance drunkenly around the room to the music blaring from Sidney's stereo. The track finishes and they stand gasping for breath. \nWOMAN I'm gonna powder my nose. Why don't you put on something a little more romantic? She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers around, playing air-guitar for a moment. \nThe music is suddenly switched off. He turns to find Mrs Kowalski standing beside the record player, staring grimly at him. \nSIDNEY Mrs Lebowski... \nMRS KOWALSKI Kowalski. You know what time it is? The music blaring, your door open... \nSIDNEY (trying to seem sober) Was it? Fuck. I mean, shit. Sorry. I just...met an old friend and brought them back... The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us. She is NAKED. She is also surprisingly muscular. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) ...for a little... He notices the woman. His gaze drops to below the waist. \n", "test1_true": "31 INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 31 \nA hung-over Sidney wakes up in his bed, light streaming through the window. \n32 BATHROOM 32 He examines his reflection, psyching himself up for his first day. \nSIDNEY You can do this! You can do this! He hums the fanfare from the Rocky theme. \n33 LIVING ROOM 33 Sidney walks into the room, still humming the theme tune, shadow boxing. He opens the blinds and turns to the couch. The \"Woman\" wakes up from where she has been sleeping on the couch and gazes blearily at Sidney. \nSIDNEY Quick coffee Bob and then you've got to go. \nWe hear the opening of Brian Ferry's version of The `In' Crowd as we... \n34 EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING 34 \nAs the song continues we see Sidney swagger down the busy sidewalk towards us. He is wearing sunglasses and a T-shirt emblazoned with a photograph of Keanu Reeves and the caption \"Young, Dumb and Full of Cum.\"The T-shirt is riding up a little over his belly. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) This is my city. He stops at a gleaming chrome entrance and stares up at the Heywood Building towering above him. \n35 INT. HEYWOOD BUILDING - ENTRANCE SECURITY - MORNING 35 \nAs the song continues Sidney, still swaggering, is escorted through the formidable looking security by a thin and chic ASSISTANT. The entrance hall arches above them, a vast and impressive cavern of chrome and glass. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) This is my building. \n36 INT. LIFT - MOMENTS LATER 36 \nSidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift examining the Chic Assistant and two stunningly beautiful MODELS who are in conversation. Sidney manages to catch the attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes is a rakish smile. In return he receives an icy glare. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) These are my models. \n37 INT. SHARPS MAGAZINE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 37 \nThe Chic Assistant leads Sidney down a curving, red carpeted corridor, past a chrome wall inscribed with the giant logo of the magazine. They reach a set of double doors which the Assistant opens for Sidney... \nSIDNEY (V.O.) And this... Sidney walks through into... \n38 CLAYTON HARDING'S OFFICE 38 Harding swings around in his chair to glare at us, a cigarette in his mouth. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) ...is my Boss. \nCLAYTON HARDING What the fuck are you wearing? The song grinds to an abrupt halt. Sidney loses a quantity of swagger. He examines his T-shirt. \nSIDNEY You like it? I brought you one. He takes a T-shirt from his satchel and hands it to Harding. \nCLAYTON HARDING Thanks. Casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind him. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Next time you come here dressed like that, you follow the shirt. You understand? Sidney nods dumbly. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Sit down. How was the flight? \nSIDNEY \n(SITTING) Good. Thanks for the business class tickets, Clay. Harding regards him gravely. \nCLAYTON HARDING That was a mistake. And don't call me Clay. \nSIDNEY Oh. Well, if it's any consolation I got downgraded anyway. \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(GRAVELY) That is some consolation. Sidney notices that the copy of The Post-Modern Review is on the desk - Clayton NAKED. \nSIDNEY \n(NERVOUSLY) Ha! That was just a little, uh... as it happens I'm a big fan of your earlier, funnier work. Snipe Magazine that was...that was really good. \nHarding stares at Sidney. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Yeah, you've...you've actually been a big influence on me and I really think together we can inject a bit of that Snipe spirit into this magazine. Now I've got a few ideas that I'd like to... \n", "test1_id": 1227, "test2_input": "CLAYTON HARDING \n(INTERRUPTING) You think you've arrived, doncha? Well I hate to break it to you, but you're only in the first room. It's not nothing, don't get me wrong, but there are plenty of people in this town who never made it past the first room. After a year or so, maybe longer, you'll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second. Eventually, if you're lucky, you'll discover another doorway back of the second room that leads to the third. He gazes at Sidney through narrowed eyes. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) There are seven rooms in all. You're in the first, I'm in the seventh, and doncha forget it Sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration. \nSIDNEY \n(BEAT) So...if I make it to the Seventh Room - will I become a true Jedi Knight? Harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette. \nCLAYTON HARDING Which brings us to the subject of your sense of humour. I had a look through your \"magazine\" here. \nSIDNEY What'd you think? Clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out over the Manhattan skyline. \nCLAYTON HARDING Oh, I thought it was...kinda snarky. And bitter. And... witless. \nSidney digests this. Clayton seems lost in thought. Finally... \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) I'm going to try you out in the I Spy Section. \n39 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 39 \nSidney is hurrying to keep up with LAWRENCE MADDOX (40's) as he strides down the corridor. Lawrence is Canadian, handsome, one of the golden boys of the magazine and arrogant with it. Other EMPLOYEES pass them as they walk, heads down, expressions serious. The place is a model of quiet, professional industry. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (glancing at Sidney's \nCLOTHES) Well, Sidney. We've only just met but already I perceive I am in the presence of a rare comic sensibility. \nSIDNEY Thanks. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX I know your Hi-jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in Olde England but things are going to be a bit different here. Harding wants me to be your Rabbi, show you the ropes. Are you aware of what we do at I Spy? \nSIDNEY You photograph famous people when they're drunk? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(IGNORING HIM) I Spy is the nation's window onto High Society. The Looky-Loos read us because...well, They Weren't There. The Glitterati read us because we tell them They Were There. For this system to work we have to know where There is. \nSIDNEY So...when we go out to clubs and things...would that, would that be on expenses or...? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX This isn't a vacation. It's a vocation. \nMaddox sweeps around the corner into an open-plan office area. Fact-checkers and Assistants buzz around. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) When we do go out you're going to have to wear something more suitable. \nSIDNEY Okay. What do you mean by suitable? Maddox gestures at Sidney's body. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Something that covers all of this up. He starts to check messages on his desk. Sidney, trying to seem at ease, stares at a black and white PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. \nSIDNEY Is that Mussolini? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (Beat.) ) No, Sidney, that's Richard Heywood. The owner of this magazine. \nSIDNEY Oh. Looks a little like, uh...(pointing to the child in the photograph, smiling) Who's this funny looking kid? Is that his son? Maddox stares at him. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(ICILY) That's his daughter, Elizabeth; now my wife. A SUBTITLE materializes like a halo around Maddox's head. It reads: Do Not Fuck with Me. \nSIDNEY \n(FLUSTERED) Really? Well, she's very...isn't she? Really, very... Someone walks up behind Sidney. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Miss Olsen here takes care of the gallery openings, book launches and other intellectual fare. Can you find our new rookie something to do? \nSidney turns to find Alison behind him, eating an apple. She eyes him coldly. \nALISON I hear the Cultural Editor's job is up for grabs? \n40 LATER 40 Alison sits working at her computer. Sidney appears and perches on the edge of her desk. \nSIDNEY Listen, seeing as how I'm going to be sitting just over there, don't you think we should try and put last night behind us? \n", "test2_true": "SIDNEY I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. (Beat) Are you going to help me out? \nALISON Okay. Which way did you come in? Sidney stares at her. Alison takes some contact sheets from her desk and shoves them at him. \nALISON (CONT'D) Chris Blick exhibition opening. Caption it. Now get off my desk. One of the magazines gorgeous Fashionistas - INGRID - walks past. \nINGRID \n(TO ALISON) Hi! \nALISON Hi, Ingrid. Ingrid stares at Sidney's outfit, thrown. \nSIDNEY (a wolfish smile) You going to introduce me? \nALISON This is Clark Baxter. (Noticing Ingrid's gaze) He's English. \nINGRID (That explains it) Ohh...right. \nSIDNEY Actually it's Sidney. Sidney Young. Clark Baxter is my alias. \nINGRID Why do you have an alias? \nALISON He uses it when he's trying to pick up transsexuals. \nINGRID \n(CREEPED OUT) Nice to meet you. She walks on. \nSIDNEY \n(TO ALISON) I take it you knew about Bob and didn't tell me? Alison inscribes a circle in the air with her finger without looking up. \n41 LATER 41 Sidney is on the phone. He is staring at some contact sheets. \nSIDNEY Hello, is that the Parsons Gallery? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Yes, it is. This is Celia Parsons speaking. \nSIDNEY This is Sidney Young from Sharps Magazine? We're running some photographs from your opening of the Chris Blick exhibition, and I just need to caption them. I was wondering if you could help me identify some of the people? \nWOMAN'S VOICE \n(OVER PHONE) All right. \nSIDNEY Thanks. So...Chris Blick. Man or woman? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) What? \nSIDNEY Is Chris Blick a man or woman? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \n(BEAT) Are you sure you're calling from Sharps magazine? \nSIDNEY Yes, I am. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \n(ICY) Tell me Stanley, why have they given you this assignment if you don't know who one of the most famous artists in America is? \nSIDNEY I...I don't really know. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \n(SNAPPING) He's a man. \nSIDNEY Okay. Is he an old man? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \n(BEAT) He's an older man, yes. \n", "test2_id": 1228, "test3_input": "CLAYTON HARDING We don't do hatchet jobs here. \nSIDNEY It isn't a hatchet job! \nCLAYTON HARDING This opening quotation - \"It's only too easy to catch people's attention by doing something worse than anyone else has dared do it before...\" Who are you thinking of here? Vincent or yourself? \nSIDNEY He's a talentless, pretentious little twat who thinks cinema began with Tarantino and someone needs to say it. And you told me to do something with teeth! You said... \nCLAYTON HARDING I'm trying to run a fucking magazine here! Sidney stares at him, angry and disappointed. \nSIDNEY \"A free press is the last defence against the Tyranny of Stupidity.\" \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(IRRITATED) Save me your tin-pot philosophy, okay? \nSIDNEY It isn't mine. It's yours. First issue of Snipe. \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(FURIOUS) Oh, grow the fuck up, will ya! You're not Robin Hood and you never were. You bitch about famous people for the same reason I bitched about them. Because they got invited to the Party and you didn't. Well you're at the Party now so quit bitching and do your job! You're on your last life here, you understand? One more fuck up like today and you're gone. \nSIDNEY Won't you have to run a decision like that past Eleanor first? For a second Clayton looks like he might throw his ashtray at Sidney. Then he controls himself. \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(SITTING DOWN) Get out. Sidney crosses to the door. \nSIDNEY (he can't help himself) Looks like I was too late to save you after all. He walks out. \n80 INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY 80 \nSidney walks back through the magazine's open plan area. CO- WORKERS stop whatever they're doing and watch him pass in silence. Then, slowly, one of them begins to CLAP. \nSomeone else joins in. Then someone else. Soon they're all clapping. Someone gets up on their desk, then another... Sidney smiles faintly then... BLINKS out of HIS DAY-DREAM. Everyone around him is working as always, paying him no attention. \n81 EXT. CLAYTON HARDING'S HOUSE - THE HAMPTONS - DAY 81 \nWe are TRACKING through Magazine Staff, celebrities, politicians and children as they mill about the lawns of the sprawling mansion, enjoying the Fourth Of July celebrations which are in progress. Clayton greets guests - the perfect host. We find Sidney, wearing unfashionable shorts, socks and shoes. He is talking to Alison. \nALISON You hired a stripper? \nSIDNEY I didn't \"hire\" him. Bob did it for a favour. \nALISON I thought you wanted to be a success here? \nSIDNEY I do! It's just...(ruefully) It wasn't me. It was Clark. Alison laughs. \nALISON The famous alter-ego? How long's he been hanging around? \nSIDNEY Since I was a kid. Anytime something got broken, or the bathroom got accidentally set on fire - it wasn't me. It was Clark. (Beat.) The weird thing is, he kind of took over. \nALISON How old were you? \nSIDNEY I don't know, twenty, twenty one... Alison laughs. \nALISON'D) Well, let me tell you, if only you could get rid of that Clark, you could be a real winner. \nSIDNEY \n(DEPRESSED) Clayton's not going to print anything I write. I've been on salary for six-months and I've written precisely one hundred and seventy five words. On a dollar- per-word basis, I'm the highest paid writer in the history of this magazine.(Beat) He's not going to renew my contract. \nALISON \n(SIGHS) What did you expect, Sidney? Vincent's one of Eleanor's clients. I told you. They're Untouchables. \nSIDNEY I thought Clayton was different. I really did. (Beat) The only thing I'm good at is pissing people off, and he won't let me do it. (Beat) \"My glory walks hand in hand with my doom.\" (Off her look) Troy \nALISON Troy who? \nSIDNEY Troy, the movie. He stares around him at the other guests. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Everybody hates me here. You're the only one who'll talk to me. \n", "test3_true": "SIDNEY (a little embarrassed) No, I mean it. You're the person who's been most, you know... uh...abusive to me. Alison laughs again. They smile at each other. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) You want another drink? \nALISON (beat, smiling) Alright. I'll have a beer. Sidney walks off. \n82 EXT. BAR - DAY 82 \nSidney is getting a drink at the bar that has been set up in the grounds. Suddenly he stiffens, watching as Sophie Maes, looking spectacular, walks over to where Maddox and his circle are talking nearby. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Sophie, my darling. Looking ravishing as always. Whilst the two are engaged in kissing cheeks, Sidney takes a credit card from his wallet and drops it surreptitiously by Sophie's feet. \nJOURNALIST \n(TO MADDOX) You know what I read the other day? Your collection of poems - The Hollow Heart? Man, they're great. Sidney reacts to this, feeling troubled for some reason. \nSOPHIE MAES You write poems? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX In another life. The BARMAN is handing out drinks. \nBARMAN And a White Russian? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Right here. Sidney stares at the drink, feeling like he's just been punched in the stomach. Maddox notices him. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Well, well, if it isn't Sidalee. Maddox notices the card at Sophie's feet. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) (picking it up) What's this? \"Hon Young\". \nSIDNEY That's...that's mine. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX But your name's not \"Hon\". \nSIDNEY (reaching for it) It's short for \"Honourable\". \nLAWRENCE (whisking it away) As in, \"the Honourable Sidney Young\"? \nSIDNEY Can I please...? \nLAWRENCE (holding it out of \nSIDNEY'S REACH) So how come it says \"Hon Young\"? They made you sound like some Korean medical student. The people gathered around laugh. \nSIDNEY They screwed it up. Please. \nLAWRENCE Sidney baby, you don't wanna go faking a British title to impress Sophie. It's the Fourth of July. (Handing back the card): We're celebrating the fact that we threw a bunch of British aristocrats out. Sidney smiles tightly. Suddenly... \nSIDNEY Why don't you shut up, Maddox? Beat. The others look to Maddox to see how he will react. Maddox smiles dangerously. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Careful Sidney. Remember - if it wasn't for us you'd all be speaking German. \nSIDNEY You're Canadian. If it wasn't for us you'd be speaking French. Sophie giggles. Maddox doesn't like this but before he can answer Sidney walks off. \n83 INT. HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 83 \nAlison is about to walk into the bathroom when she hears the sound of muffled sobbing and stops. She peers through the slightly open door. HER P.O.V - Elizabeth Maddox stands at the mirror, staring at her reflection. For once she is not wearing her dark glasses and we can see her eyes are red raw from crying. \n84 A LITTLE LATER 84 Elizabeth walks out of the bathroom, dark glasses back in place, her face a mask once more. She walks off. Alison slips out from a nearby room and watches her go, miserable with guilt. \n85 EXT. HOUSE - LATER 85 \nSidney is staring over to where Alison and Maddox are standing by some trees, deep in conversation. Maddox is tossing nuts into the air and catching them in his mouth. \nSIDNEY (muttering to himself) Choke. Choke. He puts his fingers to his temples as if to channel telekinetic powers. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Choke...choke... Sidney realizes Harding's wife is passing with her two daughters. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Hello, Mrs Harding. Lovely party. With a look of alarm she shepherds the girls away. A tall older man dressed in white with a long white beard appears next to Sidney. \nOLDER MAN How are you? Sidney nods gloomily. \nOLDER MAN (CONT'D) Has anyone ever told you before that you have an unusually dark aura? \n", "test3_id": 1229}

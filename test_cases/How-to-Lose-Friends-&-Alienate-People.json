{"train": "HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS AND ALIENATE PEOPLE \nWritten by \nPeter Straughan \n09/05/07 SHOOTING SCRIPT FADE IN: \n1 TV SCREEN - BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE 1 ...British, fifties, a melodrama. We're looking at an ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk. \nREVERSE A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He is staring raptly at the actress. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) All my life I've been a Looky- Loo. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n2 INT. GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS - EVENING 2 \nSLOW-MOTION We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring past us with a dazzling smile. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) My name's Sidney Young. I'm a journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah, that...that isn't me. We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG - thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to dislike him. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is me at the Golden Globe Awards in L.A. this year. That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm wearing. Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is at a table with several other people, all staring raptly past us to the stage which is out of shot. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Those people all around me - they're all famous. They're my friends. Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES (20's). \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) That's the actress Sophie Maes. This morning she told me she would let me have sex with her if she won the Best Actress Award. Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with her hands and begins to stand. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) She just won the Best Actress Award. Sophie walks out of the shot. Still sporting the fixed smile, Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in the room. We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) My life didn't used to be like this. We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves impossibly looking at... \n3 EXT. LONDON - LEICESTER SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON 3 \n4 SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT 4 ...a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope, craning their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering, shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down. A CAPTION reads: \"Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta Awards. London.\" \nSIDNEY (V.O.) Looky-Loos. That's what They call you when you stand out in the rain all night just to catch a glimpse of Them going by. REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to wave at the fans. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I used to pretend it was different for me because I was getting paid by a magazine or newspaper, whatever. But that's, you know...I just loved watching Them. I'd stand outside looking in through the window and think what it would be like to somehow get inside. But there was only one way to get past the thin red line that separates the celebrities from the civilians. You had to be famous. \n4A EXT. SECURITY POINT - LATE AFTERNOON 4A \nSidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security gate. He has a small, ugly PIG on a leash. \nPR WOMAN Babe? \nSIDNEY Babe Three. Yeah. She looks doubtfully at the pig. \nPR WOMAN Babe was a cute little piglet. \nSIDNEY Harry Potter used to be a cute little piglet too. What do you want? Tempus Fugits... \nPR WOMAN He hasn't got any ID. \nSIDNEY How many pigs are coming tonight? Look, I was told to bring him, hand him over to the producer, Bob Milton, inside. You want me to leave him here with you, that's fine... \nPR WOMAN No, you can't leave him with me. I've got...Hold on, I'll... She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement. \nPR WOMAN (CONT'D) If you're positive that you're supposed to... An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over. \nOLDER PR WOMAN \n(ICILY) Well, well, Sidney Young. \nSIDNEY \n(RUMBLED) Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type woman. She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them. \nOLDER PR WOMAN The pig doesn't get in. \nShe starts to walk away. \nSIDNEY What about me? \nCLAYTON HARDING Sure. On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review - glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom... Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF - patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears to be NAKED. A headline reads \"Clayton Harding - The Editor's New Clothes? Clayton's shoulder's heave with a snort of repressed laughter. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) (examining the cover) I especially liked the part where Clint Eastwood beat the shit outa ya. \n20 INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 20 \nSidney lights a cigarette, trying to seem casual. \nSIDNEY We're not scared of you, Harding. You want to sue, go ahead and sue. It's like Jimmy Stewart said, (a poor Stewart impersonation:)\"You sit up there and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr... Mr... \n21 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 21 \nClayton is still flicking through the magazines. \nCLAYTON HARDING Potter. \nSIDNEY (O.S.) \n(OVER PHONE) \"Mr. Potter...\"You go ahead and sue if you want, but I warn you, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. An ASSISTANT walks in. Clayton looks up. \nASSISTANT \n(SOFTLY) Miss Taylor is here sir. Clayton nods and quickly throws the magazines into a BOTTOM DRAWER of the desk. Sidney is still talking over the phone, beginning to enjoy himself. \nSIDNEY (O.S.) Destroy me and a hundred more will spring up in my place - men who care nothing for success, men who cannot be bought, men whose only loyalty is to... \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(CALMLY) I want you to come and work for me at Sharps Magazine in New York. \n22 INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY 22 \nSidney stares to where the Thin Man is trying to get out of the door with the Fax Machine, the Large Woman struggling with him. The two fall to the floor. The rest of the staff gather around them. \nSTAFF \n(CHANTING) Fight, fight, fight... \nSIDNEY \n(INTO PHONE) Um...could you say that again please? We hear the sound of an aeroplane engine build as we... \n23 AN AEROPLANE ROARS THROUGH THE BLUE SKY. 23 \n24 EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY 24 \nSidney emerges from the airport, wearing his crumpled brown suit, dragging his suitcase behind him. He stares around, excited to be here. \n25 EXT. NEW YORK - HELL'S KITCHEN - EVENING 25 \nSidney drags his suitcase down the quiet street and stops outside an apartment block, checking the address. \n26 INT. STAIRS - EVENING 26 \nAn elderly Polish lady - MRS KOWALSKI - is leading Sidney up the stairs of the building. \nMRS KOWALSKI This magazine you are working for? It is good? \nSIDNEY It's Sharps Magazine. You know Sharps? It's sort of society, fashion, crime, finance, Hollywood celebrities... \nMRS KOWALSKI \n(SCORNFUL) Hollywood. Sodom and Gomorrah. Now everybody is celebrity. You take out your breasts, you are celebrity. \nSIDNEY (eyeing her chest \nDOUBTFULLY) Well, I think it depends on the breasts but... \nMRS KOWALSKI \n(OBLIVIOUS) In Poland, someone was famous because they had done something...Marie Curie...Pope John Paul... \nSIDNEY Yeah, they don't make entertainers like that any more... Mrs Kowalski cuffs the back of his head. Sidney is somewhat surprised by this familiarity, having only just met the lady. She opens an apartment door. \nALISON Morgan Freeman? \nSIDNEY No, in the headlock. \nALISON You had this laminated? \nSIDNEY Oh just give it... He snatches the photograph back, catching Alison's glass in the process. Her drink SPILLS over her notebook - soaking the page she has been writing. \nALISON Shit! \nSIDNEY It's okay. It's okay. I've got it. He tries to blot the page with a napkin, smearing the ink. \nALISON Just...just leave it! She examines the book, furious. \nSIDNEY Sorry. He tries to think of something to say. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) It's pronounced Gloucester by the way. \nALISON \n(ICY) Are you going to get off that seat? \nSIDNEY No. \nALISON \n(BEAT) Do you know the meaning of Karma? \nSIDNEY The curry? \nALISON (inscribing a circle in \nTHE AIR ) What goes around, comes around. The moment is approaching when you will pay the price for being an asshole. When my boyfriend gets here I'm going to put my pacifist leanings to one side and encourage him to take you outside and... Her cell-phone rings. She answers it. \nALISON (CONT'D) Hello? Hi, honey.(Beat) Oh. (Beat) no, no, it's...don't worry about it. I'll see you then. She hangs up, avoiding Sidney's gaze, embarrassed and annoyed. \nSIDNEY Boyfriend not coming? \nShe stares straight ahead, gathering her things. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) \n(CONCILIATORY) Listen, I'm sorry. Do you think...? She turns to him. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Do you think I could have his drink? Alison gives him a cold smile, controlling her temper. She spots a heavily made-up WOMAN walking past. \nALISON Bobbie? \nWOMAN Hey! \nALISON You want a seat? I'm just leaving. \nWOMAN Thanks. The Woman takes Alison's place at the bar. \nSIDNEY (to the newcomer) Hello. He slides the PHOTOGRAPH over to her. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood. Alison gives a small smile and leaves. \n30 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 30 \nSidney and the Woman dance drunkenly around the room to the music blaring from Sidney's stereo. The track finishes and they stand gasping for breath. \nWOMAN I'm gonna powder my nose. Why don't you put on something a little more romantic? She staggers off down the hall. Sidney, giddy with excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his old turntable. It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead. He staggers around, playing air-guitar for a moment. \nThe music is suddenly switched off. He turns to find Mrs Kowalski standing beside the record player, staring grimly at him. \nSIDNEY Mrs Lebowski... \nMRS KOWALSKI Kowalski. You know what time it is? The music blaring, your door open... \nSIDNEY (trying to seem sober) Was it? Fuck. I mean, shit. Sorry. I just...met an old friend and brought them back... The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us. She is NAKED. She is also surprisingly muscular. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) ...for a little... He notices the woman. His gaze drops to below the waist. \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(INTERRUPTING) You think you've arrived, doncha? Well I hate to break it to you, but you're only in the first room. It's not nothing, don't get me wrong, but there are plenty of people in this town who never made it past the first room. After a year or so, maybe longer, you'll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second. Eventually, if you're lucky, you'll discover another doorway back of the second room that leads to the third. He gazes at Sidney through narrowed eyes. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) There are seven rooms in all. You're in the first, I'm in the seventh, and doncha forget it Sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration. \nSIDNEY \n(BEAT) So...if I make it to the Seventh Room - will I become a true Jedi Knight? Harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette. \nCLAYTON HARDING Which brings us to the subject of your sense of humour. I had a look through your \"magazine\" here. \nSIDNEY What'd you think? Clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out over the Manhattan skyline. \nCLAYTON HARDING Oh, I thought it was...kinda snarky. And bitter. And... witless. \nSidney digests this. Clayton seems lost in thought. Finally... \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) I'm going to try you out in the I Spy Section. \n39 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 39 \nSidney is hurrying to keep up with LAWRENCE MADDOX (40's) as he strides down the corridor. Lawrence is Canadian, handsome, one of the golden boys of the magazine and arrogant with it. Other EMPLOYEES pass them as they walk, heads down, expressions serious. The place is a model of quiet, professional industry. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (glancing at Sidney's \nCLOTHES) Well, Sidney. We've only just met but already I perceive I am in the presence of a rare comic sensibility. \nSIDNEY Thanks. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX I know your Hi-jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in Olde England but things are going to be a bit different here. Harding wants me to be your Rabbi, show you the ropes. Are you aware of what we do at I Spy? \nSIDNEY You photograph famous people when they're drunk? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(IGNORING HIM) I Spy is the nation's window onto High Society. The Looky-Loos read us because...well, They Weren't There. The Glitterati read us because we tell them They Were There. For this system to work we have to know where There is. \nSIDNEY So...when we go out to clubs and things...would that, would that be on expenses or...? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX This isn't a vacation. It's a vocation. \nMaddox sweeps around the corner into an open-plan office area. Fact-checkers and Assistants buzz around. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) When we do go out you're going to have to wear something more suitable. \nSIDNEY Okay. What do you mean by suitable? Maddox gestures at Sidney's body. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Something that covers all of this up. He starts to check messages on his desk. Sidney, trying to seem at ease, stares at a black and white PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. \nSIDNEY Is that Mussolini? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (Beat.) ) No, Sidney, that's Richard Heywood. The owner of this magazine. \nSIDNEY Oh. Looks a little like, uh...(pointing to the child in the photograph, smiling) Who's this funny looking kid? Is that his son? Maddox stares at him. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(ICILY) That's his daughter, Elizabeth; now my wife. A SUBTITLE materializes like a halo around Maddox's head. It reads: Do Not Fuck with Me. \nSIDNEY \n(FLUSTERED) Really? Well, she's very...isn't she? Really, very... Someone walks up behind Sidney. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Miss Olsen here takes care of the gallery openings, book launches and other intellectual fare. Can you find our new rookie something to do? \nSidney turns to find Alison behind him, eating an apple. She eyes him coldly. \nALISON I hear the Cultural Editor's job is up for grabs? \n40 LATER 40 Alison sits working at her computer. Sidney appears and perches on the edge of her desk. \nSIDNEY Listen, seeing as how I'm going to be sitting just over there, don't you think we should try and put last night behind us? \nSIDNEY (staring at a \nPHOTOGRAPH) Okay, I've got two old men here - so is he the fat one? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \n(BEAT) You do realize that Clayton Harding is a personal friend of mine? \nSIDNEY \n(BEAT) What's that got to do with anything? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Right. She hangs up. Beat. Sidney looks around, hoping no-one was listening. He re-dials. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Parsons gallery. \nSIDNEY Is he the one with the wonky eye? \nShe hangs up again. \nCUT TO \n42 INT. LOBBY - LIFT - DAY 42 \nSidney, coming back from lunch, gets into the lift eating a HAMBURGER. Another of the magazine's Fashionistas - ANNA - gets into the lift and tries to hold the door open for an approaching friend. The doors swish shut, Anna pulling her hand out of the way just in time. The lift rises. \nSIDNEY It's fashion sensitive. If you're not wearing Prada it'll take your arm clean off. Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled. \nANNA But I am wearing Prada. The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to read. The lift begins to rise again. Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work. Sidney stares at them. \nSIDNEY \n(MOUTH FULL) This isn't what I expected. Alison recoils slightly. \nALISON What did you expect? \nSIDNEY I don't know. The Algonquin circle. Dorothy Parker. Martinis. Quips. Look at them. Not one of them is drunk. \nALISON It's called being a professional. You should try it some time. \nSIDNEY There's something you should understand. I'm not really one of you. \nALISON By \"you\" do you mean \"human?\" \nSIDNEY I mean the glossy posse. Bunch of Zombies, writing about \"Pets of the Stars\" but acting like they're working for the UN. I'm here to shake things up a bit. Where are you from? \nALISON Not that it's any of your business, but I'm from Port Huron, Michigan. \nSIDNEY Right. Small town girl. (Hannibal Lector impersonation) I bet you could only dream of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice? Getting all the way - to the N...Y...C. (Dropping the impersonation) Take my advice, don't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously. For a moment Alison is speechless with anger. \nALISON You...you...arrogant... The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur. Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature. For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a moment, gagging. The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her. Alison closes her eyes. Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket. Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away. Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip. \n43 CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 43 Alison is haranguing Sidney. \nALISON \n(HISSING) Are you insane? That was Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth! Her father owns Sharps! \nSIDNEY That was her? The Mussolini baby? He stops. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I could go back and tell her I'm... \nALISON No! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do NOT talk to her! Don't even make eye-contact with her? Do you understand? \nSIDNEY Am I supposed to be afraid? \nALISON Yes. \nSIDNEY I don't know the meaning of the word fear. \nALISON I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of! She walks on, shaking her head in disbelief. \nALISON (CONT'D) When I think of all the people who would kill to be where you are. And you lumber in here, spitting food, haven't got the brains God gave a mollusc...why did Clayton hire you? \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Funny I should run into you. I've just done this great little film called Five Boroughs and it's you know, low-budget, first-time director but very, uh, moving and... Hey, maybe you could do a little...? \nA handsome YOUNG MAN passes by. Maddox instantly turns away from Rachel. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(SMOOTHLY) Angelo, good to see you. Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt dismissal then slips away. Sidney watches her go, feeling for her. \nSIDNEY \n(TO MADDOX) You know that was Rachel Petkoff? She's a fantastic actress. Hasn't done anything for years, but, in her day... \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(COOLLY) I'm sure. \nSIDNEY Seriously, I've heard about that film. I think she's going to make a come back. We should get there first, do a profile or something before everyone else... Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry- looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his customary SHADES. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(FAWNING) Vincent! Great to see you. Children, I'd like to introduce you to Vincent Lepak, enfant terrible and in, my opinion, the most exciting new director in American cinema. Vincent nods, frowning, looks around. \nVINCENT I think this is the worst fundraiser I've been to in my whole life. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX It's a rat fuck, isn't it? Sidney walks away. \n47 ANGLE ON RACHEL 47 ...standing at the parapet, smoking, staring out over the city with red eyes. Sidney appears beside her. \nSIDNEY Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel Petkoff? Rachel turns to look at him. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) This is sort of embarrassing but... He holds out a napkin. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Could I have your autograph? Rachel, suspecting she is the target of ridicule, looks around to see if there's an audience. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I'm a big fan. \nRACHEL \n(HARD) Is that so? \nSIDNEY Absolutely. I must have seen everything you've been in. Those episodes of The Love Boat and the Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In The Night...I've even seen your first ever TV appearance. The Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors. Right? \nRACHEL \n(THROWN) Right... \nSIDNEY My all time favorite? A Day Too Long. (He means it) You were really great in that. Rachel stares at him. She hides her emotion with a bright smile. \nRACHEL \n(LAUGHING) What's your name, honey? \nSIDNEY Sidney Young. She takes the napkin and pen, her face glowing. \nRACHEL \n(WRITING) Sidney Young. I'll remember that. \n48 ANGLE ON VINCENT 48 ...holding court to Maddox, Alison and some of the Glitterati. Sidney joins them, eating more food. \nVINCENT You look around and it's all shit. No-one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX I'd have to disagree with you, Vincent. Vincent looks at him, displeased. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) You're making movies that are worthwhile. Vincent accepts this with a curt nod. \nVINCENT This is what I'm saying. You have to inspire yourself. I am my role- model. I want to be me... He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike. \nSIDNEY \n(SUDDENLY) Greatest film ever made? \nVINCENT Excuse me? \nSOPHIE MAES No. \nSIDNEY Because I would certainly vote for you for best supporting dress! Huh, huh, huh.... \nSOPHIE MAES \n(STRUGGLING TO \nUNDERSTAND HIM) I haven't been nominated for anything. \nSIDNEY No, I'm just...I'm saying you look... They have reached the front entrance of the hotel. Eleanor steps between them. \nELEANOR JOHNSON \n(TO SOPHIE) Are you ready dear? The front doors glide open to reveal a LEGION OF PAPARAZZI waiting outside. As Sophie steps outside there is a sudden roar of photographers shouting and the night sky blazes white as HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS FLASH SIMULTANEOUSLY. \nREVERSE - the group framed in the entrance-way - blinded by the glare, squinting. Only Sophie has her eyes open, smiling, looking like a star. \n50 EXT. OUTSIDE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER 50 \nThe Paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they make their way to the waiting car. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX \n(TO ALISON) We're going on to the Circle Club. I'll see you tomorrow. \nALISON \n(TIGHT) Okay. Good night. Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders. \nSOPHIE Aren't you cold? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX I'm from Canada, land of ice and snow. They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them. \nSIDNEY Budge up. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Where are you going? \nSIDNEY I'm coming to the club. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Sorry, you're not on the list. A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at Sidney. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) See? Even Cuba says so. Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie kissing the dog on the nose. The Paparazzi hurry back to the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison and Sidney staring after the car. \nSIDNEY \n(FUMING) That's... that turns my stomach. Pawing her like that. He's old enough to be her father. \nALISON \n(IRRITATED) No he isn't. \nSIDNEY Yes he is. I started producing sperm when I was thirteen, so you know, technically... \nALISON For your information he wasn't pawing her! He was just doing his job! In case you haven't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month. And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor's. So do not piss her off. \nSIDNEY She's a flak. Hacks don't take orders from flaks. And I don't think you can call that \"doing his job.\" The man had no blood left in his upper body... \nALISON \n(SNAPPING) Will you...? Oh, and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic I love Con Air skit would you mind...? \nSIDNEY I wasn't being ironic... \nALISON ...would you mind not involving me, especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important. \nSIDNEY Yeah, I could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his bed time. The car disappears into the distance. They watch it go. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Do you think she'd go out with me? \nALISON Who? \nSIDNEY Sophie Maes. You think she'll go out with me? \nSIDNEY Listen, you know how things work around here. How am I going to get something in the magazine? Alison stares at him. \nALISON I thought all this \"fluff\" was beneath you? \nSIDNEY It is but...things have changed. \nALISON What's changed? \nSIDNEY Look, I know people think I'm a bit of an idiot and maybe I haven't started off too well here, but I want...I want... He seems so awkward that Alison begins to soften a little. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) ...I want to have sex with Sophie Maes. (Beat) Before Maddox does. Alison's expression turns to disgust. \nALISON You're loathsome, you know that? \nSIDNEY \n(OBLIVIOUS) I know he's got a head start on me but I'm going to win her back. Once I get my hooks into a girl, they never get free. \nALISON Like ring-worm. She gets up and stalks out. Sidney glances through the glass partition and sees MADDOX walking past. \nSIDNEY \n(TO HIMSELF) The gloves are coming off. We hear the opening of Brigitte Bardot's Moi Je Joue as we... \n55 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 55 \nSidney is pitching to Clayton in the elevator. \nSIDNEY Okay. Celebrity Trash Cans. The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to... Five bottles of Jack Daniels, a court order, and a copy of Mein Kampf? Mel Gibson! \nCLAYTON HARDING (getting out the lift) First Room, Sidney. First room. \n56 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 56 \nA small group of GLITTERATI pass the immense line of hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by the DOORMAN at the entrance. Sidney walks confidently up, pretending to talk into his cell. The Doorman stands in his way, impassive. Still talking Sidney turns and walks away as if nothing has happened. \n57 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 57 \nSidney standing with a MODEL-TYPE in the elevator. He takes a LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH from his wallet and shows it to her. \nSIDNEY (pointing at the snap) Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood? \nMODEL Morgan Freeman? \nSIDNEY No, not...why's everyone say...? There! In the head-lock! \n58 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 58 \nSidney pitches to a closed door in the office. He is holding a LARGE PIECE OF CARD on which is drawn a TREE decorated with the heads of various CELEBRITIES. \nSIDNEY It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates all of the sexual pairings of Hollywood's top stars and how they interconnect... From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written First Room. We hear a TOILET FLUSH. \n59 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 59 \nSidney approaches the Doorman , takes a ten dollar bill from his pocket and hands it to the Doorman. The Doorman crumples the bill up and throws it away. Without a word Sidney begins to walk away. He comes back and picks up the crumpled note and then heads off again. \n60 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 60 \nHarding is eating lunch at his desk. He looks up and finds Sidney staring down at him with puppy-dog eyes. Beat. Harding sighs. \nCLAYTON HARDING If I give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone? Sidney smiles. The song ends. \n61 INT. STUDIO - DAY 61 \nNathan Lane shakes hands with Sidney as he sits down. \nNATHAN LANE Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you. \nSIDNEY Great to meet you Nathan. I'm a big fan. I love that rat thing you played in The Lion King. \nNATHAN LANE \n(PLEASANTLY) Actually he's a meer cat. \nELEANOR JOHNSON Lawrence is taking us to lunch at Cipriani. \nSIDNEY \n(JEALOUS) Oh great. That's great. \nSOPHIE MAES Lawrence? Could I leave Cuba here? He doesn't like Italian food. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Of course you can. He can stay in my office. Sidney? Fetch Cuba a bowl of water, will you? Sidney stares at him. \nSIDNEY (forcing a smile) Of course. \n64 WATER-COOLER 64 Eleanor is getting a cup of water from the cooler. Sidney joins her, waiting to fill the dog's bowl. \nELEANOR JOHNSON That is a lovely ring. Where is that from? \nSidney looks at the wedding ring he wears on his little finger. \nSIDNEY \n(EMBARRASSED) It was my mother's. She gave it to me. \nELEANOR JOHNSON \n(SMILING) Oh, you Sweetie. That is very, very...(dismissing the topic) So, listen...You've met Vincent Lepak haven't you, Sidney? \nSIDNEY Uhuh. \nELEANOR JOHNSON He has a new movie coming out soon and Lawrence is over- stretched as it is. How would you like to write a story on him? Alison, at the photocopier nearby, listens. Sidney smiles, filled with hope. \nSIDNEY A story? Absolutely. That would...I'd love to... \nELEANOR JOHNSON \n(SOFTLY) Well, great. Maybe we could get together and discuss the angle? \nSIDNEY Okay. (Beat) What do you mean? \nELEANOR JOHNSON Well, I'd need to know how we're going to present Vincent, check the story, so on. \nSIDNEY \n(BEAT) You want copy approval? \nELEANOR JOHNSON \n(SMILING) Any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest, that's all. If things work out with Vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on Sophie? What do you think? Alison listens, her face registering her distaste. \nSidney looks over at Sophie, struggling with himself. Finally... \nSIDNEY \n(RELUCTANTLY) I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't...I don't work that way. Alison stares with surprise at Sidney. He just went up in her estimation. \nELEANOR JOHNSON \n(AMUSED) Sidney dear, think of it like this: you write about one of my clients, you are borrowing some of their \"star-light\" to help sell your magazine. All I'm saying is quid pro quo. Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker. \nSIDNEY Their star-light? Eleanor's face hardens. \n65 MOMENTS LATER 65 Sidney watches Sophie, Maddox and Eleanor as they walk towards reception. \n66 INT. MADDOX'S OFFICE - LATER 66 \nSidney cracks open the door and peers inside. Cuba sits in the middle of the floor, staring at him. He emits a low growl. Sidney slides into the room. \nSIDNEY Hello Cuba. I'm Uncle Sidney, come to see how you are. You wanna play? You wanna little play? He takes a RUBBER BALL out of his pocket and holds it up for the dog to see. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Fetch! He tosses the ball in the air. Cuba runs after it and trots back, stumpy tail wagging, the ball in its teeth. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) That's it! That's it! \nHe strokes the dog. \n(NERVOUSLY) Clayton? Have you got a minute? Clayton lights a cigarette, stares out of the window. Sidney comes in. \nCLAYTON HARDING Did they find that rat yet? \nSIDNEY No...Not yet. I think maybe he got out the building? Sidney hovers. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Congratulations on the Man of the Year thing. How was the lunch? \nCLAYTON HARDING I don't know. Thousand dollars a plate, all I could taste was ass. I'm kissing their ass, they're kissing my ass. (Beat) I get this dream sometimes. Someone's set fire to the building - Heywoods - Sharps magazine - the whole thing, it's going up in flames. My analyst thinks it's an anxiety dream. I never tell him how happy I am watching the fucker burn. Sidney isn't sure what to say. Finally... \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) What do you want? Sidney takes a deep breath. \nSIDNEY I want to do a story on Vincent Lepak. Not a puff-piece. Something funny, but with teeth. The kind of thing Snipe would have done. Everyone's treating him like he's a genius and he's an idiot. Clayton notices the CLOSET-DOOR beside him and opens it. He stares at the rows of blue shirts hanging in there. He takes an armful out and examines them. \nCLAYTON HARDING Look at these things. How'd I get a closet full of blue fucking shirts? \nSIDNEY Um...I don't know. \nCLAYTON HARDING I don't know either. This is an office for Christ's sake! Why've I even got a fucking closet? He drops the shirts. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Do it. \nSIDNEY (he can't believe it) Do it? \nCLAYTON HARDING Fuck it. Yeah. Do it. He's an annoying little prick. Go take him down. This is your shot. \nSIDNEY Thanks Clayton! \nCLAYTON HARDING You're my little Hit Man. \nSIDNEY \n(BEAMING) I'm your little Hit Man! \nCLAYTON HARDING Go do it! \nSIDNEY \n(HAPPILY) Okay! He scuttles out. He ducks back around the door. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) You could call me The Jackal! \nCLAYTON HARDING Out. \nSIDNEY \n(HAPPILY) Okay! He ducks back out again. \n69 INT. TRIBECA GRAND HOTEL - NIGHT 69 \nSidney is waiting in the lobby. A slightly spaced YOUNG WOMAN approaches him. \nASSISTANT Mister Young? \nSIDNEY Yes? \nASSISTANT I'm Sophie Maes' assistant. I'm afraid Sophie isn't here right now. \nSIDNEY (looking past her) Look I know she's in. I'm not a stalker. I just know she's upset about losing her dog and... \nASSISTANT \n(FIRMLY) She isn't here. \nSIDNEY \n(SIGHING) Well, can I at least check that she got my present? \nASSISTANT Okay. Did you send the flowers? \nSIDNEY \n(SNORTING DERISIVELY) Flowers? Yeah,'cos she doesn't get enough flowers, does she? No, I sent her the fish. The Young Woman looks suddenly nervous. \n(LAUGHING) What? \nSIDNEY Just most poets you see aren't really good-looking, are they? Spend their time stuck in a room, end up looking like Golem. Is he...? \nALISON He's very handsome, thank you. \nSIDNEY \n(GLOOMILY) Right. \nALISON You know what I don't understand? You're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why wouldn't you play ball with Eleanor, write the puff-piece? \nSIDNEY I resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star, okay? I choose to gush sycophantically. Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) It's okay anyway. Clayton's given me a story. I'm on my way. \nALISON \n(SMILING) Well, that's good. Sidney smiles back at her. They look at each other...it's almost the start of a MOMENT... Then suddenly on the TV above the bar, a MOVIE TRAILER begins. Distracted Sidney turns to watch - it's Sophie Maes' new film - The Suffragette - Sophie, a glamorous Emily Pankhurst... Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away, suddenly awkward. \nSIDNEY \n(EMBARRASSED) Okay, well...better get going.(Leaving) You take my advice, you'll get yourself a boyfriend who's going to show up once in a while. He leaves. Beat. Alison stares at the empty stool beside her. \n71 INT. MEETING ROOM - MORNING 71 \nClayton is rounding up another staff meeting. Sidney sits trying to contain his excitement. \nCLAYTON HARDING Which makes it...a half page left. Lawrence? Any ideas? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Yeah. Rachel Petkoff, fabulous sixties actress, one of my all time favourites. Just made a wonderful movie called Five Boroughs. I think she's poised for a come-back and I think we should get there first, do a profile. Sidney stares at him in disbelief. He looks over to Alison who avoids his gaze. \nCLAYTON HARDING Sounds good. Let's do it. Okay that's it people. \nSIDNEY Uh...Clayton? \nCLAYTON HARDING What? \nSIDNEY Did you read my story on Vincent Lepak? Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction. \nCLAYTON HARDING What? Oh, yeah. That's...that's not going to work. Sidney can't believe it. Clayton gets up to leave. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Oh, and for those who haven't heard, Alison is going to be running the I Spy section from now on as Lawrence here has just gone up in the world. He is replacing Greg Roberts as Deputy Editor. Lawrence smiles modestly as the room applauds. Sidney looks like he is going to implode. \n72 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 72 \nMaddox passes Sidney in the corridor. Sidney glares after him. Suddenly... \nSIDNEY Rachel Petkoff? One of your favourite actresses? You'd never fucking heard of her! That was my idea! Lawrence stops and turns back. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX So it was. You have any more good ideas don't forget to bring them to my new office. He is about to walk on but remembers something. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) By the way, there've been complaints about you skulking around the water-cooler, trying to talk to women. It's inappropriate behaviour. \nSIDNEY \n(LIVID) What? You spend half your life chatting up the staff! \nLAWRENCE MADDOX When I do it it's called flirting. When you do it it's called sexual harassment. Consider this an official warning. I won't tolerate sexist behaviour. He walks off. Sidney glowers after him. \n73 INT. LAWRENCE MADDOX'S OFFICE - DAY 73 \nLawrence is holding a meeting in his new office - half a dozen heads of departments sit around drinking coffee. Lawrence sits behind his desk, enjoying his new authority. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX I know that wasn't Greg's way of working but Greg isn't deputy editor any more. I am, and I'm making changes. There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in with an attractive BLONDE WOMAN in a long coat and dark glasses. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) What? \nSIDNEY Uh, Lawrence? This lady's been looking for you? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (to the woman) Can I help you? \nWOMAN Are you Lawrence Maddox? The new deputy editor? \nCLAYTON HARDING We don't do hatchet jobs here. \nSIDNEY It isn't a hatchet job! \nCLAYTON HARDING This opening quotation - \"It's only too easy to catch people's attention by doing something worse than anyone else has dared do it before...\" Who are you thinking of here? Vincent or yourself? \nSIDNEY He's a talentless, pretentious little twat who thinks cinema began with Tarantino and someone needs to say it. And you told me to do something with teeth! You said... \nCLAYTON HARDING I'm trying to run a fucking magazine here! Sidney stares at him, angry and disappointed. \nSIDNEY \"A free press is the last defence against the Tyranny of Stupidity.\" \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(IRRITATED) Save me your tin-pot philosophy, okay? \nSIDNEY It isn't mine. It's yours. First issue of Snipe. \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(FURIOUS) Oh, grow the fuck up, will ya! You're not Robin Hood and you never were. You bitch about famous people for the same reason I bitched about them. Because they got invited to the Party and you didn't. Well you're at the Party now so quit bitching and do your job! You're on your last life here, you understand? One more fuck up like today and you're gone. \nSIDNEY Won't you have to run a decision like that past Eleanor first? For a second Clayton looks like he might throw his ashtray at Sidney. Then he controls himself. \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(SITTING DOWN) Get out. Sidney crosses to the door. \nSIDNEY (he can't help himself) Looks like I was too late to save you after all. He walks out. \n80 INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY 80 \nSidney walks back through the magazine's open plan area. CO- WORKERS stop whatever they're doing and watch him pass in silence. Then, slowly, one of them begins to CLAP. \nSomeone else joins in. Then someone else. Soon they're all clapping. Someone gets up on their desk, then another... Sidney smiles faintly then... BLINKS out of HIS DAY-DREAM. Everyone around him is working as always, paying him no attention. \n81 EXT. CLAYTON HARDING'S HOUSE - THE HAMPTONS - DAY 81 \nWe are TRACKING through Magazine Staff, celebrities, politicians and children as they mill about the lawns of the sprawling mansion, enjoying the Fourth Of July celebrations which are in progress. Clayton greets guests - the perfect host. We find Sidney, wearing unfashionable shorts, socks and shoes. He is talking to Alison. \nALISON You hired a stripper? \nSIDNEY I didn't \"hire\" him. Bob did it for a favour. \nALISON I thought you wanted to be a success here? \nSIDNEY I do! It's just...(ruefully) It wasn't me. It was Clark. Alison laughs. \nALISON The famous alter-ego? How long's he been hanging around? \nSIDNEY Since I was a kid. Anytime something got broken, or the bathroom got accidentally set on fire - it wasn't me. It was Clark. (Beat.) The weird thing is, he kind of took over. \nALISON How old were you? \nSIDNEY I don't know, twenty, twenty one... Alison laughs. \nALISON'D) Well, let me tell you, if only you could get rid of that Clark, you could be a real winner. \nSIDNEY \n(DEPRESSED) Clayton's not going to print anything I write. I've been on salary for six-months and I've written precisely one hundred and seventy five words. On a dollar- per-word basis, I'm the highest paid writer in the history of this magazine.(Beat) He's not going to renew my contract. \nALISON \n(SIGHS) What did you expect, Sidney? Vincent's one of Eleanor's clients. I told you. They're Untouchables. \nSIDNEY I thought Clayton was different. I really did. (Beat) The only thing I'm good at is pissing people off, and he won't let me do it. (Beat) \"My glory walks hand in hand with my doom.\" (Off her look) Troy \nALISON Troy who? \nSIDNEY Troy, the movie. He stares around him at the other guests. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Everybody hates me here. You're the only one who'll talk to me. \nSIDNEY Yup. \nOLDER MAN You should walk with bare feet as much as possible, ground all that negative energy. Sidney examines him. \nSIDNEY So...you're a wizard or...? \nOLDER MAN I'm a spiritual healer. \nSIDNEY You can make a living doing that? \nOLDER MAN Oh God no. I'm a dentist. They stare at the party for a moment. \nOLDER MAN (CONT'D) You want to do some coke? \nSIDNEY Um...no, thanks. \n86 LATER 86 Rachel Petkoff stands talking to some other guests. Sidney notices her and walks over. \nSIDNEY Hey! Hello again? Rachel smiles at him distantly, clearly not remembering him. \nRACHEL Hello. (Turning back to the others) No, Lawrence is a wonderful writer. I really felt like he got to the heart of me. Sidney snorts. Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, have we...? \nSIDNEY Sidney. Sidney Young. We met at... Another GUEST walks past Sidney and kisses Rachel. \nGUEST I saw Five Boroughs the other day and wept! \nSidney hovers for a moment, ignored, and then walks away. \n87 LATER 87 Dusk. The guests have gathered on the lawns to watch the fireworks. There are oohs and aahs as the rockets light up the sky. Suddenly... \nSIDNEY (O.S.) In-ger-lernd! Puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk Sidney is standing on the balustrade of the porch of the house. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) In-ger-lernd! In-ger-lerrrrrrnd! He spots HUGH GRANT amongst the crowd, watching him, puzzled. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) You! Grant! Come on! In-ger- lerrrr... With that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the shrubbery below. \n88 LATER 88 Sidney limps through the trees, dabbing at a scratch on his face. He passes Alison who is sitting on a tree-swing, lost in thought, swigging absently from a bottle of wine. \nALISON You okay? \nSIDNEY What? \nALISON I said are you okay? \nSIDNEY I'm fine. Yup. Fine. (Beat) You? \nALISON Yup. (Beat) No, actually. I hate my life so, you know, I'm gonna get drunk. Sidney nods, vaguely. They stand in awkward silence for a moment. Then... \nSIDNEY Right...See you... He walks off. Beat. He walks back into frame suddenly. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) \n(FURIOUS) \nHOW COULD YOU? \nALISON \n(STARTLED) What? \nSIDNEY How the...You...having an affair with Maddox! I mean...Maddox for Christ's sake! The Man With Hidden Shallows! Jesus! I mean, I used to think you were...I was starting to...I mean, at first I thought you were a pain but then I started to think...but I mean...Maddox? How can you live with yourself? Alison stares at him, pale, blinking back tears. \nALISON \n(QUIETLY) I couldn't. That's why I've broken up with him. \nSIDNEY Well, that's no...that's, you know...(Beat) You broke up with him? Alison walks off. Beat. She walks back. \nALISON Which leg did you hurt? \nSIDNEY \nALISON (CONT'D) Secondly... \nSIDNEY Yeah, okay. Listen, you try driving in this state you're gonna kill yourself. \nALISON Who'd care if I did? Beat. Suddenly she bursts into tears. Surprised, Sidney stands, uncertain what to do. \nALISON (CONT'D) \n(SWAYING FORWARD) I've got to go. Got to go. Sidney holds her to stop her falling. He stares back at the pool and then down at Alison. \n94 INT. ALISON'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 94 \nSidney is driving. Alison is still drunk. \nALISON \n(SLURRING) I thought I had it all figured out. A - get the hell out of Port Huron, come to New York. B - do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while I, you know, write the novel. C- Win a Pulitzer. E... \nSIDNEY \nD. \nALISON D - I don't know what D was. Then I took the internship at Sharps and I met Maddox and he was...he was so...and before I know it I'm writing, you know, Ten Tips for the fucking Metrosexual and pretending this is what I wanted but this ISN'T what I wanted! And that's...that's why I hated you... \nSIDNEY I didn't know you hated me. \nALISON \n(OBLIVIOUS) ...because you were right about me. I'm a ghoul, writing fluff! \nSIDNEY You're not a Ghoul. You're a Zombie. Alison leans her head against the window. \nALISON But he isn't the person you think he is, okay? Maddox. That's just a front. He thinks he's let himself down by giving up the poetry and he's unhappy. And the marriage is a sham, I mean... I just...I couldn't end it. I just couldn't and... \nSIDNEY (can't take anymore) Look, I don't need to hear this. \nALISON \n(STUNG) Fine. \nShe begins to root through her bag. \nALISON (CONT'D) Need a cigarette. Where are my fucking cigarettes? \nSIDNEY You don't smoke. \nALISON Oh yeah. She looks at her reflection in the window. \nALISON (CONT'D) Do you think I have low self- esteem? Am I afraid of a real relationship? Do I think an affair is all I deserve? I mean, okay, he's handsome and successful and he's great in bed... \nSIDNEY \n(IRRITATED) Could you just be quiet? He realises she has started to cry. \nALISON When I told him I couldn't see him any more...I don't know if he cared. I love him and, and I don't know if he cares! Sidney watches, moved. \nSIDNEY \n(RELUCTANTLY) Well, I'm...I'm sure he does. He's probably just not very good at expressing his emotions. \nALISON \n(SOBBING) I'm so fucking sophisticated! I mean there's not even a little bit of Port Huron left, right? I've got the haircut and the job and I've got the parties and I've even, I've even got the affair because that's what sophisticated fucking people do! \nSIDNEY Alright. Alright. Don't, you know, get snot everywhere... \nALISON Oh G-God... \nSIDNEY What? Alison lurches down out of sight and is sick on Sidney's shorts. \n95 INT. CAR - LATER 95 \nSidney is driving through Manhattan, the windows down. Alison is asleep. \n(SMILING) Please, call me Richard. I've written a little book so I'm doing a few talks. \nALISON A book! Hey - I'm writing a book. What's yours about? Don't tell me - it's a thriller, right? \nRICHARD YOUNG \n(LAUGHING) No, nothing so interesting I'm afraid. I'm a philosopher. \nALISON \n(SURPRISED) Philosophy? Really? Have you written any... Alison stops dancing, stares at him, something occurring to her. \nALISON (CONT'D) Oh my God...Richard? R.C. Young? You're R.C Young? (To Sidney) You...you didn't say... Sidney avoids her eye. \nRICHARD YOUNG \n(TO SIDNEY) I'd love to hear what you think of the book if you have time to read it. Alison snorts with laughter. \nALISON What would Sidney know about philosophy? \nRICHARD YOUNG Well, he does have a Masters in the subject. Alison stares at Sidney. She breaks into a snorting laugh again. \nALISON You're shitting me! Sidney? He...he likes Con Air! She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea. \nALISON (CONT'D) I...I don't feel very well. Mrs Kowalski stands up. \nMRS KOWALSKI Come on. It is time you went to bed. (To Sidney) You can sleep on the couch. \nALISON Okay. Better go before I find out something else I don't know about Sidney. Mrs Kowalski turns to Richard. \nMRS KOWALSKI It was a pleasure to meet you Lord Young. Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly. \n98 LATER 98 Richard and Sidney sit alone. \nSIDNEY You should have said you were coming. \nRICHARD YOUNG \n(WRYLY) That would have required you answering one of my calls. \nSIDNEY I've been pretty busy. \nRICHARD YOUNG Which reminds me, I was talking to a publisher friend of mine the other day. He mentioned that they were planning a series of introductory texts on philosophers. I wondered if you would be interested? \nSIDNEY \n(ANNOYED) I have a job, dad. \nRICHARD YOUNG Of course, of course. I picked up a copy of your magazine at the airport. Sidney stiffens a little. \nRICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D) Most enjoyable. (Beat) I particularly liked the young Hollywood actress who said she'd like to start her theatre career \"somewhere small, like London or England.\" \nSIDNEY \n(IRRITATED) Why've you always got to do this? It's...it's... \nRICHARD YOUNG It was just a joke Sidney... \nSIDNEY Actually it's not. Because you're saying that what I do for a living is worthless and... \nRICHARD YOUNG I don't think it's worthless. I just think, in your heart, you know you could do more with your life than... \nSIDNEY \n(ANGRY) More? Sharps is one of the most respected magazines in the world. There's a million hacks who would kill to be where I am now. \n(MORE) \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) You know who I interviewed recently? Nathan Lane. \nRICHARD YOUNG I don't know who... \nSIDNEY I KNOW you don't know who that is! You don't know who anyone is! You thought Brad Pitt was a cave in Yorkshire! But most people do know who they are, okay? And most people wouldn't think that a journalist who gets to mix with stars like that was a, a disappointment! \nALISON Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies. \nSIDNEY Yeah, I suppose. I used to see her on the TV every now and then when I was growing up. Sort of weird. He carries the plates over to her. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Here we go! English fry-up. Perfect hangover cure. Sidney puts a plate of bacon, eggs and sausages in front of her. Alison stares at it, going green. Suddenly she darts from the room. \n101 LIVING ROOM - LATER 101 Sidney is tidying. He upsets Alison's bag from the couch and its contents spill onto the floor - the NOTEBOOK is amongst them. Sidney stares at it, hesitates and then, unable to resist, opens it up and starts to read. Alison walks into the room. Sidney looks up guiltily. \nSIDNEY Sorry, I was just...uh...(He can't think of an excuse) ...rooting through your private possessions... Alison sits on the couch, feeling too ill to be annoyed. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I like the opening. \nALISON You do? \nSIDNEY I do. Can I read the rest of it? Believe it or not, I'm a pretty good editor. \nALISON I don't know. I don't even know if I'm going to bother finishing it. \nSIDNEY \"Keep true to the dreams of thy youth.\" Alison examines him through narrowed eyes. \nALISON Is that from Troy again? \nSIDNEY Schiller. She puts her things back in her bag. \nALISON I'll jump in the shower and then I really will get out of your hair. Sidney watches, not wanting her to go. \nSIDNEY Oh, I forgot...I got you a present. \nHe hands her a bag. Surprised she opens it and takes out a RECORD. It's the Nino Rota sound-track to La Dolce Vita. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I was just walking past this music shop on the corner and I saw it. I thought it might cheer you up. Alison is deeply touched. \nALISON That's...I don't know what to say. (Beat) I haven't got a turntable. \nSIDNEY Oh. (Beat) Well, you can always come here to listen to it. Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the corner of the room. He selects the finale music - it's funny and sad, glamorous and romantic... They listen to it for a moment. Sidney starts to dance a little. He cha-cha's over to her and holds out his hand. \nALISON Are you kidding? I could throw up on you again. \nSIDNEY C'mon... Alison reluctantly gets up. They dance ironically. Alison laughs a little. Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind him... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n102 INT. I SPY AREA - DAY 102 \nSome weeks later. Alison sits at her desk, trying to work. She looks up and catches Maddox watching her with soulful eyes from across the room. She looks quickly away, unsettled. Sidney sits at his desk surreptitiously watching her, \nSMITTEN. \n103 INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY 103 \nAutumn. Rain lashes against the window. Alison drinks coffee. Ingrid and Anna are examining a rack of clothes behind her. Ingrid is holding up a dress. \nINGRID Hey, Alice? Versace. You like? \nALISON I'm good, thanks. \nINGRID Honey, everyone needs to change their look every now and then. Especially if they have a new man in their life. \nALISON \n(EMBARRASSED) What are you talking about? \n104 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROOM 104 Sidney is just about to enter the room. \nINGRID (O.S.) Well, that English guy is always hanging around you these days, right? Sidney freezes, listening. \n105 BREAK ROOM 105 Alison blushes fiercely. \nANNA \n(LAUGHING) Tell me it isn't so. \nALISON \nSIDNEY Your limpy pig. \nSOPHIE MAES What? \nSIDNEY I'm your limpy pig! \nSOPHIE MAES That's right! Okay, limpy pig. You need to pay a forfeit. Whatcha got? \nSIDNEY I've got my little limpy dance. Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down. \nSOPHIE MAES \n(SUDDENLY) Give me your ring. Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little. \nSIDNEY I...I can't... \nSOPHIE MAES Give me the ring. I want it. \nSIDNEY I can't. Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes. \nSOPHIE MAES Okay, give me the ring and if I win tomorrow, I'll let you have sex with me. The on-lookers shriek with delight. Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from side to side... \n137 INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 137 \nSidney is back in his own room, alone, a mess. He sits on the floor chopping lines of coke on the coffee table. He stares groggily at the space on his finger where his ring used to be. \nSIDNEY (muttering to himself) You're a star. You're a big, bright shining star... He snorts a line and, leaning back, flicks blankly through TV channels - a sports programme, a news station, a sit-com re-run... He snorts another line, flicks stations - more sports, a music video, a black and white movie... Sidney stops, staring at the screen... TV SCREEN - we're watching the fifties British movie we saw at the beginning of the film. Sidney's MOTHER is typing at the desk in the background. She gets up from the desk and walks into another office. Sidney stares, frozen. Sidney's mother passes the LEAD ACTRESS who is staring out of the window, smoking. She stares at her sympathetically. \nSIDNEY'S MOTHER (Celia Johnson accent) Don't worry Mary...you'll meet him one day. \nLEAD ACTRESS \n(SMILING SADLY) How will I know when I do? \nSIDNEY'S MOTHER Oh, when you meet the One, you'll know... She walks on. Sidney stares at the screen. \n138 EXT. BEVERLY HILTON - EVENING 138 \nA conveyor belt of limousines arriving outside the Hilton. Rain falls. Celebrities wave to the watching crowds as they make their way up the red carpet, cameras flash... Sophie emerges from a limo, looking amazing. SHE IS WEARING A FUR WRAP. She makes her way up the carpet, Sidney walks behind, smiling vaguely... \n139 INT. BEVERLY HILTON - EVENING 139 \nVarious celebrities are being interviewed. Sidney stands a little apart, lost in thought. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Well, well... Look at you... \nLawrence Maddox stands beside him, something nervous in his manner now, the old confidence gone. He has been drinking. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Made it all the way to the Seventh Room. He holds out his hand. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Congratulations. The wheel of fortune right? You go up, I go down. You're here with Sophie? How about doing your old Rabbi a favour and putting in a good word for me? Maybe a little interview? Sidney absent-mindedly takes his hand, looking past him. \nSIDNEY Is Alison here? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Alison? No, we went our separate ways. Actually she left me. Tells me she's in love with someone else. Sidney stares at him. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Nope, not you I'm afraid Sidalee. She threw us both over. Some guy named Clark. I mean...Clark. Can you believe it? But these are the sacrifices we make, right? I don't need to tell you. It's not a vacation. It's a vocation. So listen, about Sophie... But Sidney is no longer listening. \n140 INT. GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS - EVENING 140 \nSLOW MOTION - we move in on Sidney, sitting at the table, listening to the Best Actress award. This is where we first met him. \nSIDNEY (V.O.) This is me at the Golden Globes. That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm wearing. I'm inside. I'm at the centre of everything. I'm right where I wanted to be. Beside him Sophie covers her face with her hands and starts to stand, having just won Best Actress. \nSidney stares at her hands - she is wearing his gold ring. We move back into real time, sound swells up, thunderous applause. Sidney claps along with the others. Then he stands up and goes after Sophie. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) (taking her arm) I need my ring back. Sophie turns back to him, her smile fixed. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I need my ring back. As if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage, Sophie, still smiling, tries to pull her arm free. Eleanor is instantly beside them, trying to disengage Sidney's hand. \nELEANOR JOHNSON (smiling, hissing) What are you doing? Let her go! \nSIDNEY She isn't the One. My mother gave me that ring and told me I had to give it to the One. She isn't the One. The applause is still going strong. TV Cameras move in on Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping. Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger. Officials move in. \n", "test1_input": "SIDNEY Tits of Fury. She laughs. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) \n(SMILING) I'm joking, I'm just...It's a bio- pic. About Greta Garbo. That's why I thought of you. You have those amazing cheek-bones and...are they real? Have you had plastic surgery? \nHOLLYWOOD ACTRESS No. Have you? \nSIDNEY Me? No, hardly anything. A penis reduction as a child, that's pretty much... She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't believe this - she likes him! \n13 INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 13 \nThe lift doors glide open and the Pig trots out and around the corner. The PR Woman is still at the door to the courtyard, berating one of her staff. The Pig sails past them both, unnoticed, and disappears into the party. \n14 INT. SHARPES PARTY - EVENING 14 \nA YOUNG MAN sits drinking at a table. He slips a little bag of Ecstasy from his pocket and takes one. \nUNDER THE TABLE As the Young Man pushes the bag back into his pocket. The Pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back out and DROPS to the floor. The Pig sniffs at the bag... \n15 SIDNEY AND HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 15 ...still talking. The place is crammed now, and hot. Sidney wipes sweat from his forehead. \nHOLLYWOOD ACTRESS Oh god, I'm drunk. \nSIDNEY Are you? \nHOLLYWOOD ACTRESS I'm so drunk. I haven't eaten and... \nSIDNEY You feel okay? Because my room's just upstairs if you want to lie down or, or loosen any, you know, morals or... \nHOLLYWOOD ACTRESS \n(LAUGHING) What is your name again? \nSIDNEY Clark. Clark Baxter. He takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes loose and hangs limply from his face. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) How'd you do? The Actress stares at him in surprise but Sidney doesn't notice - he is staring past her to where there is something of a COMMOTION amongst the guests. The PR Woman is hurrying across the room, hissing into her ear-piece. Somebody screams. Then to Sidney's horror a group of guests scatter in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed: the Pig charges into view, heading straight for him. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) \n(MUTTERING) Oh, shit... The Pig suddenly skids to a halt and stares at Sidney with hot eyes. The PR Woman follows the Pig's gaze and spots Sidney. \nOLDER PR WOMAN \n(INTO HEADSET) Sarah, get security! Code Red. Sidney Young got in! \nHOLLYWOOD ACTRESS \n(FEARFULLY) Who's Sidney Young? Before Sidney can answer the Pig charges. \nSIDNEY Oh, shit! Sidney turns and legs it. \nACROSS THE ROOM We are looking OVER THE SHOULDER of a tall grey-haired MAN who stands in the shadows watching Sidney run past. This is CLAYTON HARDING, his face hidden for the time being. \nHe lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches Sidney's flight, rolling the BOOK OF MATCHES between his fingers. \nBACK WITH SIDNEY ...as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles. Sidney screams, trips and flies through the air, wig spinning free, hurtling straight towards a table of startled celebrities. We FREEZE FRAME. SUPERED TITLE - \"How To Lose Friends & Alienate People.\" We hear the opening of David Bowie's Star. \n16 INT. HOTEL CORRIDORS - LATER 16 \nAs the TITLES and song continue we see a protesting Sidney and Pig being escorted by Security through the endless corridors of the Hotel. Titles End. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \n16A EXT. LONDON FLAT - DAY 16A \nA seedy flat in Shepherds bush. \n17 INT. SIDNEY'S FLAT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 17 \nSidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear. A phone is RINGING in the next room. Sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the papers - Sidney struggling with an irate Clint Eastwood and some Security Men. The phone continues to ring. \n", "test1_true": "(CALLING) Will you get that? (Beat) Will you get the phone? Sighing he gets up and scratching himself, stumbles through to... \n18 LIVING ROOM 18 ...which we see is, bizarrely, an OFFICE - full of an odd assortment of JOURNALISTS, desks, antiquated computers and an old fax machine. The walls are lined with past covers from Sidney's magazine - The Post-Modern Review. One bears a photograph of Victoria Beckham with the title \"Posh Spice? Like Fuck She Is.\" \nA JOURNALIST is talking on the phone by the door. The other phone is still ringing. \nJOURNALIST Look, we don't hate celebrities at the Post-Modern Review, okay? We just don't think they should be taking themselves so seriously. For us a celebrity is a text to be deconstructed. Apart from Costner obviously. Sidney edges past him to where a LARGE WOMAN and a histrionic THIN MAN are in the middle of a argument, encouraged by the other members of staff. \nTHIN MAN \n(SHRILL) I wouldn't do this the honour of calling it a review. It's a puerile, personal attack in, in alcoholic prose, in which incidentally you manage to misquote both Derrida and Lyotard. I am a... \nLARGE WOMAN \n(CALMLY) Girl. \nTHIN MAN ...an internationally respected academic and... \nLARGE WOMAN Prick. \nTHIN MAN ...author of a very well received book on the history of culture and a... \nLARGE WOMAN Fuckwit. \nSIDNEY (threading his way past) Couldn't one of you answer the phone? As the argument continues behind him he reaches the phone with a bored YOUNG MAN sitting by it. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Will you answer that? What do I pay you for? \nYOUNG MAN You don't pay me. \nSIDNEY Just get the phone! The Young Man answers the phone. \nYOUNG MAN Post-Modern Review. \nTHIN MAN Sidney, if she doesn't apologise I'm quitting. \nSIDNEY (to the Large Woman) George can't leave. You'll have to apologise. \nLARGE WOMAN Why can't George leave? \nSIDNEY He owns the fax machine. Sidney notices the Young Man is staring at him with a scared expression. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) What? \nYOUNG MAN It's Sharps Magazine. Sidney stops smiling. \nYOUNG MAN (CONT'D) We're finished. \nSIDNEY We're not finished. \nYOUNG MAN They sue, we're finished. \nSIDNEY Shut up. (To the others) Will you be quiet! They ignore him and continue bickering. Sidney picks up the phone. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) Sidney Young. \nMAN (O.S.) (over phone, gravel \nVOICED) This is Clayton Harding. I'm the editor of Sharps Magazine. Sidney is visibly thrown. \nSIDNEY Ah, Lord Vader. \n19 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 19 \nSHOOTING FROM BEHIND Clayton Harding's swivel chair - all we can see is Clayton's grey hair, his custom-built desk and the enormous office in front of him. He is smoking. As he talks he rolls a BOOK OF MATCHES between his fingers. \nCLAYTON HARDING I saw you at my party, just before you ruined it with your little pig stunt. \nSIDNEY (O.S.) \n(OVER PHONE) You liked that? \n", "test1_id": 1227, "test2_input": "ALISON Yeah, so...maybe he does care after all, right? \nSIDNEY Yup. They stand in an awkward silence, watching the party. \n111 INT. WASHROOMS - LATER 111 \nA dejected Sidney stands washing his hands. Maddox walks in behind him. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Hello Sidney. Someone said you'd come as a Count but I thought I'd misheard. Sidney doesn't answer, turns to leave. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) So Alison told you we were getting together right? \nSIDNEY \n(TIGHT) Yeah. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Yeah. Should have done it long ago but, you know me - just not very good at expressing my emotions. Right? \nHe watches Sidney's reaction, smirking. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) You must be happy for her, what with you being friends... Sidney blushes. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) \n(LAUGHING) Oh Sidalee...I thought as much. Did you really think you and Alison...? Things really haven't worked out too well for you here, have they? Ah, well. You gave it your best shot. He walks out. Sidney stares after him, burning. \n112 EXT. OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT 112 \nRain pours down. Eleanor and Vincent climb into a limousine and close the door. Sidney runs up. \nSIDNEY Wait! Eleanor wait! The window glides down. \nELEANOR JOHNSON Yes? \nSIDNEY Let me do the profile on Vincent. \nELEANOR JOHNSON \n(AMUSED) I don't think so. The window begins to slide up. Sidney hangs onto it. \nSIDNEY You get full copy approval. It'll be like you've written it! The window stops. Eleanor stares at him, considering. Sidney looks past her to Vincent. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) \n(DETERMINED) Vincent - think about it, think how humiliating it will be for me. I'm begging you. Vincent leans over, stares over his shades at Sidney. \nVINCENT (Beat, enjoying this) You don't look like you're begging. Beat. Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the limousine. The rain pours down on him. The limousine drives away. Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the street. \nREVERSE On the building across the street is an ENORMOUS ANIMATED BILLBOARD L'OREAL ADVERTISEMENT - SOPHIE MAES, in a gold ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties Hollywood style. As we watch she BLOWS US A KISS. Underneath is the slogan - I'm Here... \n113 INT. CLAYTON HARDING'S OFFICE - DAY 113 \nSidney sits in front of Clayton. \nCLAYTON HARDING Lawrence Maddox is no longer working for Sharps. Seems Elizabeth got sick of him screwing around and kicked him out. \nSIDNEY She kicked him out? \nCLAYTON HARDING \n(IGNORING THIS) Richard Heywood doesn't seem to like the idea of employing an ex- son-in-law. So he's gone. So's Alison Olsen. Sidney stares at him. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Don't worry about Maddox. He's already lined up something with Gotham Magazine. I'm gonna need someone to hold the fort at I Spy. Strictly on a temporary basis, you understand? One more thing. Eleanor Johnson rang this morning, wondering if you'd like to write a profile on Vincent Lepak. Sidney stares at him. \nCLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) I don't know how you did it but somehow you've made it into the next room. \nWe hear the opening of Pretty Vacant by the Sex Pistols as we... \n114 MONTAGE 114 \n115 INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 115 \nAs the song continues we see Sidney interviewing Vincent, complete with shades. \n", "test2_true": "Vincent is wearing a crown, being photographed on a throne. Sidney and Eleanor are watching. \n117 INT. ELEANOR'S OFFICE - DAY 117 \nEleanor is going through Sidney's copy, crossing lines out with a red pen. Sidney watches. \n118 INT. SHARPS MAGAZINE - OFFICE - DAY 118 \nSidney, Eleanor and a Photo-Editor are looking at the photos from the shoot. Eleanor is pointing out a blemish on Vincent's face. \n119 COMPUTER SCREEN - VINCENT'S FACE IN CLOSE UP 119 ...as we watch the blemish disappears. \n120 EXT. NEWS STAND - DAY 120 \nSidney buys a copy of Sharps and flicks through it until he finds what he's looking for - a four page feature entitled Vincent Lepak - Long Live The King. He stares at his byline at the top of the feature. \n120A EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 120A \nAn elegant apartment building. \n120B INT. APARTMENT - DAY 120B \nSidney is being shown around a chic apartment by a Realtor. \n121 INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY 121 \nSidney is amongst the room full of writers and editors, pitching to Clayton who nods approval and passes on to the next item. \n122 INT. CLUB - EVENING 122 \nSidney and Eleanor are talking with an ACTOR. Sidney is wearing a smart suit, fawning in a suitably restrained manner. \n123 INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY 123 \nSidney is interviewing the Actor, laughing sycophantically at something he has just said. \n124 INT. OFFICE - DAY 124 \nSidney sits at his desk, looking very much the part now in another expensive suit, talking on the phone. His desk is crowded with MUFFIN BASKETS. A COURIER is handing over a GIFT-WRAPPED BOX to him. Sidney opens the box to reveal a ROLEX SEA-DWELLER 4000 WATCH. Sidney stares at the watch. \n125 INT. MOVIE PREMIERE - EVENING 125 \nSidney is drinking champagne amongst the Glitterati, talking to a Producer. Simon Cowell walks past and high- fives him. Sidney throws back his head, laughing at something the Producer said. \n126 INT. SAUNA - DAY 126 \nSidney sits in the steam room, wrapped in a towel, sweating. Slowly the steam envelops him until he has disappeared. \nEND OF MONTAGE \n127 INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING 127 \nCLOSE ON SIDNEY'S PHOTOGRAPH - looking as cool as he can. Alison sits alone reading Sharps, staring at Sidney's photo in the \"Notes on Contributors\" page. She smiles, then glances up, her smile fading. Maddox is walking towards her, drunk and sour faced. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (noticing the magazine) Well, well...little Sidalee. I feel like a proud Papa. \n(MORE) \nLAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Listen, I can't stay. Anderson wants me to go to some photographers exhibition. Hot new talent blah, blah... \nALISON Right. (Beat) How hot is she? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Who? \nALISON The new talent? \nLAWRENCE MADDOX Do you think you could drop the little wife routine? It's kind of in bad taste. Alison stares at him sadly \nALISON I guess you're right.(Quietly) What goes around comes around. Maddox is about to say something but changes his mind. \nLAWRENCE MADDOX I'll see you back home. He is about to leave when he notices Alison's notebook on the table. \n", "test2_id": 1228, "test3_input": "LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) \n(IRRITATED) And will you stop carrying that thing around with you? It's kind of embarrassing. He walks off. \n128 INT. BAR - EVENING 128 \nSidney is with Eleanor and Sophie, who now looks every inch the movie star. \nELEANOR JOHNSON Sophie's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best actress. \nSIDNEY Wow. That's fantastic.(Beat) But...the nominations haven't been announced yet? \nELEANOR JOHNSON That is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated. (Beat) So, if she is nominated we want Sharps to do a feature. Someone to cover the whole lead up, unrestricted access, the trajectory, the building of this unique brand. \nSOPHIE MAES I'm going to have a logo. \nELEANOR JOHNSON Here's the deal. Sophie wants you to do it. Sidney stares at her and then at Sophie, stunned. \nSOPHIE MAES \n(PLEASANTLY) You can be my bitch. \nELEANOR JOHNSON Merry Christmas, Sidney. This is a cover story. I think a little celebration is in order. \n129 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - NIGHT 129 \nSnow falls. Sidney climbs out of a limousine with Eleanor and Sophie. The women breeze past the Doorman and into the club. Sidney hesitates on the thresh-hold, staring up at the sign above him as if it's a magic portal. Sidney walks in. \n130 INT. CIRCLE CLUB - LATER 130 \nA surprisingly small, ultra A-list club, chic and ironic Christmas decorations. Sidney walks past celebrities and beautiful people. He's arrived. \n131 INT. CIRCLE CLUB - NIGHT 131 \nSidney stands with Kevin Bacon playing Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. People stand around watching. \nKEVIN BACON Okay, uh...Clark Gable.

CIRCLE CLUB - POWDER ROOM 131A \nA very drunk Sidney stands in a toilet cubicle with a YOUNG ACTRESS doing coke. \nACTRESS Sexiest philosopher? \nSIDNEY Uh, tricky, but I'm gonna say Nietzsche. Huge moustache. The Tom Selleck of Nihilism. \nACTRESS Um...most evil philosopher. \nSIDNEY Okay. Good. Evil genius philosopher...Hobbes, proto-Nazi, Heidegger - actual Nazi, Hegel - twat. Basically your H's... \nACTRESS Most Hollywood philosopher? \nSIDNEY Uh...Bishop Berkely. \nACTRESS What'd he say? \nSIDNEY Esse est percipi. \nFIRST ACTRESS What does that mean? \nSIDNEY If they `aint looking at you, you don't really exist. \nACTRESS \n(WEARILY) Oh honey, tell me something I don't know...

SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - MORNING 133 \nThe doorbell rings. Sidney wearing a silk dressing gown wanders through the room from the bedroom and opens the door. Alison stands outside, smiling at him. \n", "test3_true": "SIDNEY \n(THROWN) Hey. \nALISON Nice robe. \nSIDNEY Thanks. It was a gift. Ralph Lauren. \nALISON Who from? \nSIDNEY Ralph Lauren. I did a piece. Beat. He still hasn't invited her in. \nALISON I just wanted to say I heard about you getting the promotion. Congratulations. I'm happy for you. \nSIDNEY Thanks. How's things with you and... \nALISON \n(QUICKLY) Good. Fine. Everything's ...uh...I'm working for this little literary magazine. It's not the New Yorker but... (awkward) So, I've left you a bunch of messages... \nSIDNEY Yeah. I've been pretty busy. \nALISON I thought so. Alison stands awkwardly for a moment, smiling, then turns to go. \nALISON (CONT'D) Okay, well... \nSIDNEY \n(QUICKLY) How's the novel coming along? \nALISON \n(LAUGHING) Oh, well...still working on it. \nSIDNEY Well...keep at it. I believe in you. Alison smiles, touched. \nSIDNEY (CONT'D) I never gave you these. He takes some papers from a shelf and hands them to her. Alison looks at them - the are titled \"Notes On Alison's Novel.\" There's a LOT OF THEM. She laughs. \nALISON You know... \nWOMAN'S VOICE Sidney? Alison looks past Sidney to the bedroom door where INGRID the Fashionista stands in her underwear. \nINGRID (a little wave) Hey, Alice. Sidney looks at her and back at Alison. He gives a little laugh. \nSIDNEY (half joking, half \nMEANING IT) How did it all go so wrong? Alison smiles, gives a little wave and walks away - before he can see how upset she is. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \n134 EXT. LA - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY 134 \nSophie and her entourage, including Sidney and Eleanor, climb out of a line of limousines and walk into the Hotel. Sidney stands for a moment, looking around him. Hollywood. He's finally here. We hear the opening of Virgina Plain by Roxy Music. \n135 EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT 135 \nWe are swooping in towards the hotel and an enormous BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT for Sophie's new film - in pre- production. It's a re-make of Singing In The Rain - with Russel Crowe. We BOOM down from Sophie's fifteen foot laughing face to find Sidney standing on a slim ledge outside his hotel window. He is drunk and wearing only his underwear. He is also yelling with fear. The window behind him is crowded with people shrieking with laughter. Gingerly he edges back to the window and climbs back into... \n136 HOTEL SUITE 136 It's a wild party. Music is blaring, people are dancing, drinking, laughing. \nSOPHIE MAES You didn't do it! \nSIDNEY High. \nSOPHIE MAES You let me down! \nSIDNEY Too high! You couldn't do it. Too high. Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it, standing in her underwear. There is applause from the on- lookers. Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge and disappears from sight. The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling encouragement. After a moment Sophie appears at another window further along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic applause. She stares imperiously at Sidney. \nSOPHIE MAES What are you? \n", "test3_id": 1229}

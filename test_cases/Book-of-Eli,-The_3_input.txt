Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her. 
ELI You want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again. 
Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction. 
SOLARA Sorry. 
Eli resumes walking. 
ELI God has a reason for everything being the way it is. It's not always apparent to us. But it is his plan nonetheless. 
SOLARA So, is he talking to you right now? Telling you where to go? 
ELI It's not like that. It's kinda hard to explain. I'm guided by faith. 
SOLARA I don't know what that word means. 
BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it. 
ELI It means you know something even though you don't know it. 
Solara thinks about this, shakes her head. 
SOLARA That doesn't make any sense at all. 
ELI It doesn't have to. 
They walk on. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost every building burned or reduced to rubble. 
Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its surroundings for being the only structure still intact. 
The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE. 
Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby. 
SOLARA I don't get it. It looks almost... normal. Like nothing ever happened. How can it still be out here? 
ELI I don't know. 
SOLARA Maybe we should look inside. There might be food. 
BEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun. 
ELI Stay behind me. 
They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK. 
Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK. 
They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers. 
SOLARA This is weird. 
ELI Yeah. 
Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet. Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down. 
ELI Shit. 
SOLARA What? 
A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli drops his shotgun to the ground. 
They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze. 
The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal... 
AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic." 
Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara. 
They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully. The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife. 
ELDERLY MAN Who are you? 
ELI My name is Eli. This is Solara. We're travelers, that's all. We don't mean you any harm. 
ELDERLY MAN You cut my padlock. I saw you. Trying to break into our house. 
ELI I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody lived here. We thought it was abandoned, like all the rest. 
This seems to annoy the man.

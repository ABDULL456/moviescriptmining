MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her husband and children and expertly begins to serve breakfast. 
DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by trade, divides the morning paper up between himself and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly overweight college student, frantically prices the junk she plans on selling at the flea market after classes while gulping down a light breakfast. 
MOM Who wants fruit salad? 
MISTY I do, please. 
MOM (Hesitating) That's not gum in your mouth, is it? 
MISTY (Removing it) It's sugarless. 
MOM (Gently) You know how I hate gum, Misty.  All that chomping and cheesing... (Begins serving her) 
MISTY Sorry, Mom.  Thanks. (To her brother, as she prices a record album) Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice. 
CHIP I wouldn't give ya a nickle. 
MISTY (Dreamily) Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets. 
MOM (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly) And who may I ask is Carl? 
MISTY Just a boy.  He's picking me up this morning. 
CHIP Here we go again. 
MISTY He's really cute! 
MOM (Watching the cute little birds nibbling seed from the bird-feeder in kitchen window) Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that. 
CHIP She sure can pick 'em! 
MISTY (Exasperated) He goes to college with me! 
DAD Leave her alone, Chip. (To MOM) I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly. 
MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each hand and turns to the family. 
MOM Cereal anybody?

DAD Just a little, please.  Bad for the teeth. 
CHIP Always the dentist.

{"test1_input": "DINER \nWritten by \nBarry Levinson \nFADE IN: The SCREEN IS BLACK. We hear MUFFLED ROCK and ROLL MUSIC. Then we read: \nBALTIMORE \nFADE OUT. \n:FADE IN: \nINT. DANCE HALL BASEMENT - NIGHT \nFENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement. Heavy wiatei coats hang from hooks on the wall. In the b.g., there is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the rest rooms. From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE \nROCK AND ROLL BAND. Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the \"JOE COLLEGE.\" style of the late fifties. Sports jacket, button- down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a window pane. Seconds later he breaks another window with his fist. \nFenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to the sound as he approaches another bank of windows. He calmly breaks another window pane with. his fist. A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the b.g . sees Fenwick's actions and then heads up the steps. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT \nThe crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to the local group, the SH K RS, playing their popular hit HOT NUTS. The song is played toward the end of the even- ing because of its risque Lyrics. \nBAND LEADER Hot nuts, hot nuts, get from the peanut man. \nBAND LEADER (CONT' D) \nHot nuts hot nuts, get em any - way you can. \nAs the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader. The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches BOOGIE. Boogie is something of a \"Dandy,\" flashiar in dress than others in his crowd. Although he isn't particularly good looking there is something about his attitude that is very appealing to girls. Boogie aster hearing the Guy heads downstairs. \nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT Fenwick casually breaks another window with his fist. His hand is bleeding. Boogie approaches. \nBOOGIE What's up, Fen? \nFENWICK Just breaking windows, Boog \nBOOGIE. - What for? \nIt's a smile. He breaks another window with his fist. \nBOOGIE C' mon, don't be a sWuck. \nFENWICK I know that glass is made from sand, but how come you can see through it? \nHe breaks another window.

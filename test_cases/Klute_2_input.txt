INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT 
Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed. He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket around her shoulders. The transaction is still not overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt. He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against him. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say. Some lit windows; a single car moving past. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
All the windows dark this time. The deepest night, just before the sky begins to lighten. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT 
Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach. Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory business. Her expression is more wondering than anything else -- what does she have here, and can she get used to it? 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN) 
The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the sounds of trash cans being collected. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN) 
Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for something beside the bed. Her eyes open immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying gently to press her back. 
KLUTE Go back to sleep. 
But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the possible Bree. She observes: 
BREE I'm still scared. (beat) I mean different but still. (frowns) Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed? 
KLUTE My bed. 
She grins, then starts to reach for him, still receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang, turns her head away sharply. 
BREE Oh! 
He looks at her with concern, but only caresses her. She manages to explain -- 
BREE (CONT'D) I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. 
KLUTE Mm. 
BREE No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I -- 
He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She responds, but: 
BREE (CONT'D) Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. 
KLUTE Yup. 
She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely, welcomingly, full out. 
BREE Oh -- 
And we cut directly to: 
INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY 
Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry by the throat. 
BREE The son of a bitch seduced me!

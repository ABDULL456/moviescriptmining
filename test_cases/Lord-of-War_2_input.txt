EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE.  DUSK. 
SIMEON, flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS, is in the face of a YOUNG OFFICER. 
The Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS, Kalashnikovs resting on their hips. 
SIMEON Do you know who the fuck I am? 
OFFICER (thick Ukrainian accent) Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are? 
SIMEON I demand to see your commanding officer. 
OFFICER You don't demand shit. 
Simeon reconsiders his position. 
SIMEON Just give me back my papers. 
OFFICER (papers clearly visible in his hand) What papers? 
The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with the passport, starts watching TV.  The Bodyguards make to follow but the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path. 
Simeon fumes. 
YURI (O.C.) You're late, Simeon. 
YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity.  He enters the guard station as if he owns it. 
From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the situation with the Young Officer.  After a moment Yuri slips the Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport. 
Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the veteran gunrunner. 
YURI (cont'd) I invited you for a drink once before. Perhaps now you will accept my invitation. 
INT.  ODESSA HOTEL BAR.  NIGHT. 
YURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar.  Yuri flirts with the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer. 
BARMAID (to Yuri, impressed) You sell guns? 
YURI Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see my bazooka. 
The Barmaid giggles and exits. 
Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music.  His BODYGUARDS sit at the table behind. 
YURI You look a little lost, Simeon.  Is the world changing too fast? 
SIMEON I am here, aren't I? 
YURI Not all of you, I think. 
Simeon's look begs explanation. 
YURI (cont'd) You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA, you can't get that ideology completely out of your head.  The empire was evil for too long. 
Simeon shrugs. 
SIMEON I can't deny, it takes some getting used to. Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together. 
YURI There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon.  I sell to leftists, rightists.  I'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers. 
Yuri leans forward. 
YURI (cont'd) Of course, you're not a true internationalist until you've supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen. 
Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours himself another drink. 
SIMEON I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.  Instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together.  What do you think? 
Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking. 
YURI I think you are the amateur now.  I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy.  I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct. 
Simeon is confused. 
YURI (cont'd) I am the same man who was not good enough for you before.  I am not good enough for you now. 
Simeon blanches.  Yuri gets up. 
Simeon holds his rival's arm. 
SIMEON The problem with gunrunners going to war is there's no shortage of ammunition. 
Yuri departs. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM - ODESSA HOTEL.  NIGHT. 
YURI and the BARMAID never make it to the bed.  Still clothed, they bang each other against the door of his hotel room. 
YURI (V.O.) Back then, it was all for sale...

GREEN It wasn't mel 
DOYLE It's the train -- she bucks all the time -- especially in switching. She's a dog. Green glances quickly at Doyle and grins. 
GREEN What's your name, motorman? 
DOYLE Denny Doyle, sir. 
GREEN You ever been written up? 
DOYLE Yes, sir -- once.

GREEN Twice. -- once on the Canarsie -- 
BLUE That's right, Mr. Green -- tell him all about yourself. 
F Green stops and looks at Blue. 
BLUE 
(LOOKING OUT) There's the emergency power box. Green knocks off his controller and eases the brake handle to the right.

GREEN Yeah -- I'm taking the brake handle and the reverse key, Denny -- and I want your cutting key, too. He pulls the reverse key out of its receptacle and holds out his hand. Doyle fishes into his overalls, pulls out the large key and gives it to Green who puts the brake handle and the two bulky keys into his two raincoat pockets, then squeezes by Blue and the packages and goes out.

GREEN Thanks, Mr. Grey.

(EXAGGERATED) Don't mention it, Mr. Green. 
INT. SECOND CAR 
Brown slides open the door for Green, then slides it shut again. They speak in low tones. 
GREEN 
(TO BUD) Give me your cab key. 
BROWN (as Bud hesitates) You got three seconds to live, conductor -- one -- two -- Bud whips the key from his pocket and hands it to Green, who unlocks the cab door they're standing next to and enters, closing the door after him. 
BUD What's he going to do? 
CONTINUED 
BROWN You wouldn't want me to spoil the surprise. 
INT. SECOND CAR - CAB 
as Green seats himself before the panel and begins arming it. He fits the brake handle into place, then fishes. the reverse key out of his pocket -- it is five inches long, with a shiny surface, and a wrench-type handle that fits into a receptacle on the flat portion of the controller -- and finally inserts the cutting key -- similar to the reverse key but with a slightly smaller head, and turns it.

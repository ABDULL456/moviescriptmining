{"test1_input": "No.   She jumped. Angela gives him an incredulous glare.   Shakes her head. \nWEISS \nI know it's hard to accept but -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \nIsabel would never in a million years take her own life. Never. \nWEISS \nAngela... there was a surveillance camera on the roof. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nJohn marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs. Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers. John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates. \nINT. RAVENSCAR - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE \nView of the rooftop. There's Isabel in her nightgown, stepping up -- pausing just a second. Then one step and she's gone. So clear. So unrefutable. \nWIDER \nAngela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her shoulder. \nWEISS (O.S.) \nTake some time... Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was that? \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE \nA LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief. \nJOHN \nNo -- I've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think I'm going to be done in by THIS? He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER (50) sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDR. ARCHER \nYou wouldn't be the first, John. \nJOHN \nIt can't be that simple. I mean come on, Les, you saved me before. You can do it again, right. \nDR. ARCHER \nThis is different. This is aggressive. John tries to stay cool -- fails.     He TRASHES the X-ray boxes. Diseased lungs disappear.      Doc shakes his head. \nDR. ARCHER \nTwenty years ago you didn't want to be here. Now you don't want to leave. \nJOHN \nThat's because I know exactly where I'm going this time. \nINT. HALLWAY \nJohn steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here fast. \nINT. RAVENSCAR - HALLWAY \nAngela is on the move. Emotions are coming in strong. She can't get out of here fast enough. She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered one. \nANGELA \n(rushing toward it) Wait, hold the door! Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in. John stands inside alone. This should be the first time we realize they were in the same hospital. \nANGELA \nGoing down? John pauses as the doors start to close. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nNot if I can help it. The doors close right on Angela. \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN ISTANBUL - DAY \nA PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape. In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner. He grips the relic tight in one hand.   That anxious fever has returned. Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're on -- heading the opposite way. Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic tighter. Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the process. Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over as driver. Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising airliners in the distance. \nEXT. L.A. APARTMENT - DAY \nClose to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor, COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil. \nINT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT \nEvery wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum foil. A sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing in check. He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet but it's not there. Oh yeah -- in the pocket. Decision made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the walls and the window. \nEXT. ECHO PARK (DOWNTOWN L.A.) - DAY \nJohn sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars. John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes, wondering which one will be his last. \n", "test1_true": "Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?! John turns to see ELLIE (23) strutting up the sidewalk. Uninhibited. Oozing sex appeal. But dangerous. In more ways than you think. \nELLIE \nThat's funny as shit, John. \nJOHN \nAs if you guys didn't have something to do with it... \nELLIE \nHey, I think you brought this one on yourself. John stares at her, tries to get a read. \nELLIE \nNow why wouldn't you trust me? \nJOHN \nI don't know, something in the air -- She sits right on his lap, playfully. \nELLIE \nDon't worry, John, you'll beat this. You beat everything. \nJOHN \nNot this time, Ellie. John lifts her off of him, sets her aside. \nELLIE \nOh wow, you're serious... No wonder the Boss is in such a good mood. \nJOHN \nYeah, I thought maybe you could talk to him for me. You know...? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEllie jumps off the bench, creates an odd SOUND as she does. \nELLIE \nWhat?! Dammit, John, I know I owe you but to even ASK that? All those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp -- his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks. He's going to take all that out on you, John, and he's going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time. \nJOHN \nSo I take that as a 'no?' \nELLIE \nYou're the one soul the man himself would actually come up here to collect. And you know how much he despises this place. \nJOHN \nI'm starting to see his point. Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm. \nELLIE \nHave you gone to see the Snob? Like scratching fingers across a blackboard.     No way. \nELLIE \nLook, don't let your ego get in the way on this. I'd miss having someone up here I can... relate to. She gives him a kiss. And for a second John's leg is brushed by a tail. John doesn't react. Just turns and walks away. \nINT./EXT. CHAZ'S TAXI - DAY \nSeen through a mild rain is the Theological Society building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place for this city. John stares out the back seat window, takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor. He turns to Chaz -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nI'm sure I can get you in here. Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter flag back down. Tick... tick... tick... \nCHAZ \nPass. \nINT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - LATER \nA few bishops talk quietly. A cardinal studies Scriptures. Definitely not the place for atheists. John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the -- \nLIBRARY \nJohn stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class wrapped in Armani's best. The other is Father Garret. John stands to the side and waits for their conversation to end. An ATTENDANT makes the rounds. \nATTENDANT \nCan I take your coat, Mr. Constantine? \nJOHN \nNo thanks, I'm not staying long. \nATTENDANT \nHow about you, ma'am? Attendant turns to Angela standing just a few feet away, her gaze fixed on the same two men. \nANGELA \n", "test1_id": 1611, "test2_input": "I'm not like my sister. \nJOHN \nBut you were at once time. When you were kids. When you'd spend every waking hour with each other. You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd cry. \nANGELA \nThat was a long time ago... \nJOHN \nThat kind of bond doesn't just disappear. \nANGELA \nThere's nothing here. Angela seems unbalanced.     John gets more aggressive. \nJOHN \nShe planned her death in this room, she thought it up right where you're standing -- Angela backs away.     John advances. \nJOHN \nShe knew you'd come -- She counted on you to see what she saw, to feel what she felt -- to do what she did. What did she do, Angela? \nANGELA \nHow should I know? \nJOHN \nWhat did she do, Angela? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \nI don't know! \nJOHN \nWhat would you do? Angela backs into a wall.       Nowhere else to go now. \nJOHN \nWhat would you leave her? What would it be? Where would it be?! Where would it be? Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating. John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees -- \nANGELA \nThe tree. \nEXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT \nA lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard. John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.   Finally sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela. She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees. That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his hand. But this time there's more. \nANGELA \n(trying to rationalize) There must have been a tree in our backyard... when we were kids... John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything. His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol -- \nJOHN \n'COR 14:01.' \nANGELA \nCor? \nJOHN \nCorinthians. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \n(shaking her head) There is no 14h act in Corinthians. John's face goes pale -- \nJOHN \nI need a church. \nINT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER \nSeveral families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor comforts a man and wife. John and Angela slip through, head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall. They whisper. \nJOHN \nCorinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of Ethenius. It's like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned. \nANGELA \nThere's a difference? \nJOHN \nDepends on which side of the fence you're standing. John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl of holy water near the altar. \nANGELA \nSo why haven't I seen this book before? \n", "test2_true": "Because it doesn't exist here on this side. John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to \nBOIL -- \nANGELA (O.S.) \nWhat do you mean -- Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela mid-question and the room in that dim half-light. John turns and is inside -- \nSAME CHAPEL - HELL \nThe epitome of blasphemy -- A church in Hell. Only they don't worship God in here. And that's not Christ on the cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate black. John is now facing books with completely different markings. He searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow down the walls, getting closer to John with each heartbeat. He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes -- \nREGULAR CHAPEL \nANGELA \n-- not here on this side? John turns, covered in sweat. He's holding a book she's never seen, is already flipping through it. \nANGELA \nWhere did that come from? \nJOHN \n(stopping to read) 13:29. 13:30 -- Here... Corinthians 14:01... (skimming to this) 'The sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the son.' \nANGELA \nWhose son? John stands, his brain going into overdrive. \nJOHN \nSymbol isn't a demon's... that's why I couldn't place it... not a normal possession... \nANGELA \nJohn, what are you talking about? \nJOHN \nBut he can't cross over -- impossible for the son to cross over... \nANGELA \nWhose son?   God's? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nNo.  The other one. (off her look) Lucifer had a son too. \nINT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES \nBeeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp. The narrow alley of machines stretches out behind him. He stares into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page folded a thousand times. Turns another page. \nBOWLING AREA \nAmazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness, the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of beasts. \nBEEMAN (O.S.) \nOh my... \nBEHIND THE LANES \nBeeman has stopped turning pages. That's because he's now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below are ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body. But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling. A figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly welcoming the beast into this world. \nBEEMAN \nThis is not good... BOWLING BALL hits a lane.     Beeman spins to the sound. BALL ROLLS round and round, closer and closer until it CLANGS dead against the back wall of one of the lanes. Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin machines. He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the machinery and peeks out the pin hole. \nBEEMAN \nJohn? \nEXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT \nAngela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John gets her up to speed. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nThe myth says Mammon was conceived before his father's fall from grace but was born after. \nINT. SUV \nJOHN \nBut unlike his old man, he's never been in the presence of the Creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either. That goes double for us -- God's most prized creations. Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over. \nANGELA \nBut demons can't come and go, that's what you said. \nJOHN \nUnless they found a bridge. (off her look) Some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to Hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit she'd pull out. \nANGELA \nIsabel... \nJOHN \n", "test2_id": 1612, "test3_input": "Why water? \nJOHN \nIt's the universal conduit. Lubricates the transition from one plane to another. Now ask me if there's water in Hell. John turns off the faucet. \nJOHN \nSit. Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself. When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck. \nJOHN \nNormally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course... \nANGELA \n(teeth chattering) What will I see? His eyes say it all.      Enough. \nJOHN \nLie down. \nANGELA \n(gesturing the depth) Lie down? \nJOHN \nYou have to be fully submerged. \nANGELA \nFor how long? \nJOHN \nAs long as it takes.     Here -- John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her. \nJOHN \nLast chance... (off her look) Take a deep one. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngela takes a deep breath, holds it. John pulls his hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted on his the entire time. \nANGELA'S POV \nA silent John ripples above.     His hand grips her arm, skin to skin. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAngela lies there and panic sets in. She starts to surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom, holds it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out. She can't hold her breath much longer. It's not working -- But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the current were ramping down. It slows to that dim half- light as -- JOHN'S EYES -- CLOSE.     A single blink. ANGELA is lying in now BOILING WATER, screaming for all of her life. Water muffles the sound but not the fury. Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard -- snapping out of the hold down bolts. John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman? Another SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS.     Water starts streaming onto the tile. John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the water -- her muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her mouth breaks the surface. She SLAMS hard against his chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his back -- leaving marks that might just scar. TUB GIVES WAY and the damn breaks. John and Angela go down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them both. ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling.      She looks up him, eyes filled with revelation. \nANGELA \nAll those people... so sad... John nods, helping her understand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \n... I've always known... where the bad guys are... where to aim, when to duck... it's not luck... I've always known... Tears stream down her cheeks. John reaches out to touch her when her eyes CLAMP TIGHT in pain -- \nJOHN \nAngela? Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out. John pries himself from the tile, goes after her. \nINT. BEHIND THE ALLEY \nAngela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping water the entire way. John tries to keep up. \nANGELA \nIt was rolling toward him -- not a ball -- something smaller. Shiny. She stops, kneels to the floor.     John walks up to join her. Something glints in the catch trough. She reaches down, plucks it up and brings an odd COIN INTO VIEW -- John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar coin. \nJOHN \nBalthazar. \nINT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER \nBeeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets. Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also. \nCHRISTIAN RELICS \nare removed from a display cabinet. There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft of an iron cross -- all striking pieces individually but when twisted and locked together form a very imposing -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n-- HOLY SHOTGUN. \nHe swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and FIRES. BULLET leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his endless apartment, blasts the center out of -- A carton of Lucky Strikes. SETTLE ON the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away. \nANGELA (V.O.) \nCan you kill him? What about the Balance? \nINT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER \n", "test3_true": "JOHN \nThat half-breed tipped my scales when he started killing my friends. I'm just adding a little counterweight. John lifts that holy shotgun -- KA CHICK -- \nANGELA \nWhat about me?    I can't stay here forever. John turns to her -- locks on those eyes. He reaches into his coat pocket as he walks up to her. She shudders as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat they're cheek to cheek. When he pulls back she sees he has clipped Hennessey's AMULET around her neck. \nJOHN \nThink of it as a bulletproof vest. \nANGELA \nSo I'm going. \nJOHN \n(knows he can't win) You're staying in the car. \nINT./EXT. 20 LANES - DAWN \nFAT-ASS TIRES BURN under the full torque of a 426 HEMI. A jet-black '70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from the basement garage of 20 Lanes -- slides onto the streets of L.A. Angela hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob -- slams into 2nd -- leaves another layer of tread behind. \nEXT. OCEAN \nFLYING OVER the ocean, a 747 ROARS RIGHT OVER US. Dipping out of cloud cover, it reveals the coast of a sprawling metropolis stretched out miles below. \nL.A. LANDMARKS - DAWN \nstreak PAST. The Big Donut, the occult bookstores, the '57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park. This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda. He downshifts -- DRIFTS PAST a building with a facade of pre-stressed concrete and huge gold letters -- \"BZR \nFINANCE AND BROKERAGE.\" \nJOHN (O.S.) \nThis shouldn't take long. \nINT. BZR BROKERAGE \nElevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money. Lots of it. Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is practically empty. Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in. John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a \"Security Only\" door, steps inside -- leaves the door open. \nINT. TRADING ROOM \nMonitors are powering up around the room. A few of those Young Businessmen we last saw at Midnite's are here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nYOUNG TURK \n(into phone) Hey, early bird is a fat bird, know what I'm sayin'? Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug and successful businessman he is. He stops at a LONG MIRROR on one wall. Adjusts his collar, his hair. His \"look.\" \nPRETTY BOY \nWhat are we pushing today, sir? \nBALTHAZAR \nPhillip Morris. As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts slightly. The demon in him? He touches his face, does a vowel stretch. His face distorts even further. That's got him moving closer to the mirror. Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears in motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he sees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to move -- \nBOOOM -- \nOne way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a FIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and flame. John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL -- that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his holy shotgun. \nJOHN \nHow's he doing it? John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is burned off, but now he's pissed. \nBALTHAZAR \nThis is in direct violation of the Balance! \nJOHN \nScrew the Balance. John hits him with another BLAST of FLAME -- pins him hard against the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBalthazar's young turks attack. One leaps over the trading station. John swings around -- aims the SHOTGUN -- BOOM -- half-breed is blasted midair. The other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers across the ceiling. John aims up -- PUMPS SEVERAL ROUNDS -- steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a desk. BOOM -- BOOM -- that'll keep it down. \nINT. BARRACUDA \nAngela hears the GUNSHOTS. Cop instinct takes over and she gets out of the car. Checks the amulet. Intact. \nINT. BZR TRADING ROOM \nJohn turns his attention back to Balthazar, doesn't hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame. Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else underneath. The true form. \nJOHN \nHow's he doing it, you half-breed shit?! John swings the flame aside so he can KICK Balthazar against the wall. But now his WEAPON SPUTTERS. Shit. Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and grabs John by the throat. Balthazar rises from the ashes.     He may be burned, but he's one tough son of a bitch. Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't break his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages through his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred GOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand. Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him across the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying ripple throughout Balthazar's body. But he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling on him. Again and again -- each punch weakening this demon more. John finally gets him against the wall. Right arm's tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand, and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away. Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of death. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe leans up, winded. Watches in delight as Balthazar strains to take his final breaths. \nBALTHAZAR \nI will see you very soon... \n", "test3_id": 1613}

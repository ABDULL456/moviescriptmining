{"train": "CONSTANTINE \nby Kevin Brodbin \nbased on the characters appearing in \nmagazines published by DC Comics, Inc. \nprevious revisions by Mark Bomback \ncurrent revisions by Frank Cappello \nEARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT \nNovember 14, 2002 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ISTANBUL - DUSK \nGlimpses of an ancient city.   Almost motionless against the tide of time. Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns. FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees. \nINT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE \nCorridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like atomized ether. There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES. DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the -- \nFINAL CELL \nA gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying. He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year, the spoon finally breaks through. \nINT. NARROW CHANNEL \nPrisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER. \nINT. PRISONER'S CELL \nThe tapestry covering the HOLE is pulled against the wall, then billows outward like a sail. \nINT. CHAMBER - PRISONER \npulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates. And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light. He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through. Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a Nazi flag. At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead. As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face. \nMYSTERIOUS POV \nFrom BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else. Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing. \nPRISONER \nstarts toward the way out. \nINT. PRISONER CORRIDOR \nThe Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one -- falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out from the wall, revealing the hole. \nINT. PRISON - VARIOUS SHOTS \nALARMS SOUND.    Lights BLAST ON.   Guards with weapons rush through. \nINT. NARROW CHANNEL \nPrisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight. \nEXT. PRISON - NIGHT \nSIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for the trees on the other side of the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUARDS \n(in Turkish) Stop!   Stop! Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their target. Guards check their weapons on the run. \nEXT. NEAR A ROAD - NIGHT \nPrisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road. Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner spins, is right in the path of a car. BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap. CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires. He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured. Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL has appeared as if embossed in the flesh. Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off. OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nFATHER HENNESSEY (50), stands over a young teen (13), JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams again. \nHENNESSEY \nEt separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes! Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her hands and feet to the bed frame. Notice her fingernails. Drained of color. Almost black. Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical. On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all crammed into the hallway outside the opened door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one that's gone bad. The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here. GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER -- \nEXT. AGING APARTMENT BUILDING \nNot in a third world country but smack center in one of America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt liquor. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY \nEXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT \nCONTINUED: \nMAN (O.S.) \nOr how 'bout you show yourself and I put a bullet in your skull just like I did hers! \nANGELA \nThat's just not going to happen. \nMAN (O.S.) \nYou sure about that?! Angela checks the chamber -- sees she has one bullet left. \nANGELA \n(almost pleading) Now put down your weapon on the tracks and -- GROUND BEGINS to VIBRATE.     Tunnel starts to GLOW. \nMAN (O.S.) \nWell ain't this a peach?! Angela looks back, sees several SHADOWS of figures waving far off. Her RADIO is flooded with futzed CHATTER. \nDETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.) \n(over radio) Get off the tracks! Blueline is coming! Clear the tracks! Angela peeks over the track.     Still no sign of her perp. The TRAIN is coming INTO VIEW and its BEAM shoots through the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova. The SOUND is DEAFENING. \nMAN (O.S.) \nC'mon, Detective, step into the light and be saved!! Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant LIGHT. She grips her GUN and in one burst of flat-out bravado -- rises as she AIMS. And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun. Angela FIRES as both dive off the track. His BULLET RICOCHETS behind her. Hers finds its mark. Man goes down right in the train's path. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the train roars past in a staccato blur. \nEXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - DAY \nChaz's taxi pulls up, parks. \nTAXI TRUNK \nOPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.   John starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells -- \nCHAZ \nThere are four bags. I have two hands. This give you any ideas? \nJOHN \nMake two trips? John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath. \nINT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY \nEvening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area, runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally stops at a pearl-white dazzler. He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use. Number 13. John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles right on the ball -- \"PROVISIONS DEPLETED.\" He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished wood with his well-traveled Oxfords. Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity. An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it. John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins. John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the pool tables. \nINT. JOHN'S APARTMENT \nSeems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end seem like it's a mile away. Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives. \nCHAZ \n(yells across room) Simple question. How much longer do I have to be your slave? John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open. \nJOHN \nYou're not my slave, Chaz. You're my very appreciated assistant. Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend. Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand- marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of place. \nCHAZ \nHow much longer? John doesn't like his tone. \nJOHN \nWell I don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of Hell? \nCHAZ \nSo what time you want me back? John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his pockets. \nJOHN \nI need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish? Chaz sighs, starts out -- \nJOHN \nChaz...? Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nA little something from Delphi. It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow. Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing. \nCHAZ \nGee, thanks. Chaz leaves. John removes a small BLACK BOX from his jacket. He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the window -- stares out. \nBEEMAN (O.S.) \n'Provisions depleted?' John turns to see BEEMAN waddle in. \nBEEMAN \nLocker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror. Tired, aging eyes stare back. \nWEISS (O.S.) \nGutsy move out there, Dodson. Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker. \nANGELA \nGutsy?    Well that's a new one. The two exchange a look. \nWEISS \nYou're alive. Bad guy's dead. No point in using the other words. \nANGELA \nThanks. \nWEISS \n(shuts his locker) Even though it was reckless -- irresponsible -- stupid... \nANGELA \nI knew you still cared. \nWEISS \nYou're good, Angela, real good but one of these days... \nANGELA \n(heard it before) I know, nobody's luck lasts forever. He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care. Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her locker door, notices her reflection does not turn. She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it should be. She shudders, slams the locker door. \nEXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM \nSo exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nChaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which is -- \nJOHN \nTwo frogs on a bench. Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him -- he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. \nCHAZ \nTwo frogs on a bench. But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card shows a BEAR in a dress. \nCHAZ \nWhat?   But I'm with him!   Right, John?   John? John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz backs away, stares after him. Someday. \nINT. CLUB MIDNITE \nMUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro speakeasy for the new millennium. John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses, sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing off for several ladies. One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water. Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up. NICO, a young black man, walks past John. \nNICO \nNeighborhood's going to Hell. John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on. One of the men in the group turns, watches John. Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN. \nINT. HALLWAY \nJohn starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of two very large doors. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTheir surface is ancient, the wood petrified over countless centuries. John places his fingers into the gnarled folds, closes his eyes -- \nJOHN \nNumquam leadatur a morsu. A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors don't budge. \nJOHN \nBastard changed the code again. (bangs the doors) Midnite! Come on, do I have to huff and puff here?! The doors unlatch. \nINT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE \nSWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific sculpture that normally displays our solar system in relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL, ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- \"CREATOR.\" This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And it's not moving. \nMIDNITE (O.S.) \nEt separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes... John steps in through the doors behind. \nJOHN \nDeciding which color to paint this place again? PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office. Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A full six and half feet of solid contradictions. \nMIDNITE \nYou're back early. \nJOHN \nI got tired of spending your money. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPerks of becoming a primary investor. \nJOHN \nWhat?! Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now. \nBALTHAZAR \nThings change, balances shift. Get used to it, Constantine. \nJOHN \nNot while I'm still breathing -- John starts to cough again. \nBALTHAZAR \nI'm sorry, I didn't catch that. John tries to catch his breath, can't. And that scares him a bit. He tries to hide it, pushes out. \nEXT. CLUB MIDNITE \nJohn SLAMS out the exit -- coughing. He pulls the Vicks 44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector cap. \nHENNESSEY \nHey, John. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn is surprised to see Hennessey waiting. He chokes, is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle.   Hennessey grabs hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles the syrup. \nHENNESSEY \nI'm real sorry about this morning, John, real sorry. Please don't hate me for draggin' you into that. Please don't... John can finally breathe. \nJOHN \nI don't hate you. \nHENNESSEY \nThat's good to hear. Real good... \nJOHN \nBut could you at least wait until I call for you before you show up? \nHENNESSEY \nYou didn't call? \nJOHN \nNot yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out sometimes. \nHENNESSEY \nSo you want me to go away and come back? \nJOHN \nNo. I've got an assignment for you. \nHENNESSEY \nReally?   What kind of assignment? \nJOHN \nThe kind you'll have to be sober for. \nHENNESSEY \nOh God, you want me to surf the ether. He instinctively touches an AMULET around his neck.       Four intersecting crosses. \nJOHN \nCome on, you know that exorcism wasn't right. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHENNESSEY \nI... I don't have the Sight anymore. \nJOHN \nDon't have it or don't want to use it? Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him. \nJOHN \nJust look around. A few days. You spot anything unusual, anything -- you let me know. Okay? John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy, then reaches behind his neck -- \nJOHN \nIt'll be like old times. -- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's pocket. \nJOHN \nJust for a few days. \nHENNESSEY \nNo.   She jumped. Angela gives him an incredulous glare.   Shakes her head. \nWEISS \nI know it's hard to accept but -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \nIsabel would never in a million years take her own life. Never. \nWEISS \nAngela... there was a surveillance camera on the roof. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nJohn marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs. Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers. John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates. \nINT. RAVENSCAR - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE \nView of the rooftop. There's Isabel in her nightgown, stepping up -- pausing just a second. Then one step and she's gone. So clear. So unrefutable. \nWIDER \nAngela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her shoulder. \nWEISS (O.S.) \nTake some time... Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was that? \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE \nA LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief. \nJOHN \nNo -- I've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think I'm going to be done in by THIS? He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER (50) sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDR. ARCHER \nYou wouldn't be the first, John. \nJOHN \nIt can't be that simple. I mean come on, Les, you saved me before. You can do it again, right. \nDR. ARCHER \nThis is different. This is aggressive. John tries to stay cool -- fails.     He TRASHES the X-ray boxes. Diseased lungs disappear.      Doc shakes his head. \nDR. ARCHER \nTwenty years ago you didn't want to be here. Now you don't want to leave. \nJOHN \nThat's because I know exactly where I'm going this time. \nINT. HALLWAY \nJohn steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here fast. \nINT. RAVENSCAR - HALLWAY \nAngela is on the move. Emotions are coming in strong. She can't get out of here fast enough. She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered one. \nANGELA \n(rushing toward it) Wait, hold the door! Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in. John stands inside alone. This should be the first time we realize they were in the same hospital. \nANGELA \nGoing down? John pauses as the doors start to close. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nNot if I can help it. The doors close right on Angela. \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN ISTANBUL - DAY \nA PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape. In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner. He grips the relic tight in one hand.   That anxious fever has returned. Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're on -- heading the opposite way. Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic tighter. Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the process. Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over as driver. Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising airliners in the distance. \nEXT. L.A. APARTMENT - DAY \nClose to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor, COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil. \nINT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT \nEvery wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum foil. A sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing in check. He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet but it's not there. Oh yeah -- in the pocket. Decision made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the walls and the window. \nEXT. ECHO PARK (DOWNTOWN L.A.) - DAY \nJohn sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars. John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes, wondering which one will be his last. \nI'm not staying long either. John glances over and for the second time they make contact. Something about her eyes. John stares a bit too long. Angela looks back toward the fireplace. \nANGELA \nMy business with him is urgent. \nJOHN \nFirst come, first served. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \nSo you're rude no matter where you are. John gives her a look. The two men shake hands and start to part. John and Angela make their move toward the men. Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and John goes for -- -- the SNOB, officially known as GABRIEL.       Yes, that one. \nFATHER GARRET \nand Angela have retreated to another area for privacy. \nANGELA \nWhy is he stalling on this? My sister needs a Catholic funeral. \nFATHER GARRET \nAngela, it's still considered a mortal sin -- \nANGELA \nShe didn't commit suicide. \nFATHER GARRET \nThe Bishop has read otherwise. \nANGELA \nFather... David -- this is Isabel. (meeting his eyes) Please... Father Garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate. \nFATHER GARRET \nI'll talk to him again. But Angela has just lost a load of faith. \nBY THE FIREPLACE \nGabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings. The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat. \nGABRIEL \n(without looking back) I know what you want, son. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn sits across from him. \nJOHN \nBeen keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have you? \nGABRIEL \nI could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous. \nJOHN \nSo you're going to make me beg? Angela pauses on her way out, looks over. \nGABRIEL \nIt wouldn't help. You've already wasted your chance at redemption. \nJOHN \nWhat about the minions I've sent back, the souls that I've saved -- that should guarantee my passage across -- \nGABRIEL \n(keeping it private) -- No -- passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof. You have proof. And that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Your work has mostly been for selfish reasons. I'm sorry. \nJOHN \nThis is bullshit -- bullshit! Now he's really got Angela's attention. \nJOHN \nIt's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do -- help an old lady across the street -- put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime -- you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here! \nGABRIEL \nKeep your voice down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn jumps up, leans into his face. \nJOHN \nAnd you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us -- You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us -- This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin. \nJOHN \nThat's just it -- this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon. Here. On our plane. \nMIDNITE \nRight. \nJOHN \nI know what I saw. \nMIDNITE \nYou must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it -- \nJOHN \nI didn't cross over -- It was on this side. Here. \nMIDNITE \n-- it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional -- \nJOHN \nEmotional?! John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost lost. Midnite glares at a desperate John. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIDNITE \nOkay, so you saw something. We've seen a few small ones slip through now and then. \nJOHN \nIt's more than that... first the girl, then this. \nMIDNITE \nJohn, you know my connections. Any shifts or tremors in the planes and I'd hear about it. John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced. \nJOHN \nSomething's coming. Midnite sighs, gives up with him. \nINT. LAPD OFFICE - LATER \nThe name JOHN CONSTANTINE is center screen on a monitor -- typed into the police station's SEARCH ENGINE. Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking across the windows. Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors scroll under John's name. Must be a hundred PARKING VIOLATIONS. Several SPEEDING tickets and a few RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. In fact John's license has been REVOKED. But it's the other incidents that draw Angela in. \nBRIEF CLOSEUPS \nOf specific words in a few HEADLINES -- \"Occult activity on the rise...\" \"Claimed possession is refuted by Bishop...\" \"Satanic cult dissolved...\" Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos. -- BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL -- Odd SYMBOLS burned into a ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp. -- JOHN in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her son in her arms. A younger and more noble Father Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAnother line -- \"INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to PROSECUTE.\" Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made waves -- LONDON -- PARIS -- ROME -- BUDAPEST -- MOSCOW. Stops on the one that matters -- LOS ANGELES. And there's an address. Angela hits PRINT and the HP HUMS away. A desk PHONE RINGS. Angela quickly looks around, sees she's the only one here. She gets up, answers it. \nANGELA \nL.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello? Dead air. The next PHONE RINGS. Angela reaches for it when the NEXT ONE RINGS, and the NEXT, the NEXT. The RINGS HOP phone to phone in intimidating mockery. Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm.     Sure enough, the RINGS abruptly CEASE. Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer, leaves. \nINT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT - DAY \nA police guard scans passengers and a printout of the Prisoner. He walks past a man standing in the metal detector line. This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the lapel? Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver. He has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt. \nMYSTERIOUS POV \nWatching the Prisoner.      He looks back AT us, suspicious. Nothing there. \nPRISONER \nlooks back nervously, as his bag goes through the detector. \nDETECTOR SCREEN \nshows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an outline. Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT \nVARIOUS of the city -- the contrasts between the bright and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. That abandoned mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged between competing banks. \nCOME TO REST ON -- \nThe towering statue of The Good Shepherd. His hands are welcoming us into the \"HOLY CROSS CEMETERY.\" Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley. \nINT. 20 LANES - THE BAR \nJohn drinks alone.   Pissed at life.      At death. That small black box of his lies on the table unopened. Spider runs across the table. John flips an empty glass, traps it underneath. He takes a drag on his cigarette, tips the glass and blows smoke inside. Spider can't escape the poison air, bumps the glass. Trapped. Dying. \nJOHN \nWelcome to my life. \nANGELA (O.S.) \nMr. Constantine? John looks up, spots Angela.        Those eyes again. \nANGELA \nI saw you at -- \nMy sister always talked about a world better than this. Heaven as some call it. She wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her. What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \n-- she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity. (beat) That about right? The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless. John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it back -- but it's too late. She turns and starts out, slows -- \nANGELA \nYou're not the only one afraid of Hell. John tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He glances out the window, watches her pass by. So long. Good riddance. But something's not right. Those deep shadows on the buildings seem to be moving. John watches, confused, realizes they're heading in Angela's direction. \nJOHN \nOh shit... He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks the glass over. Spider runs free. \nEXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT \nCars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her. It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in with each step. \nJOHN (O.S.) \nDetective! Angela looks back, sees John in the street. \nJOHN \nHow open is your mind? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But John does. He starts walking toward her. \nJOHN \nDo you believe in Heaven and Hell? (off no answer) How about what comes out of each? Angela keeps walking.      He catches up with her. \nJOHN \nHey! \nANGELA \nYou mean like angels? \nJOHN \nAnd demons. Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up. \nJOHN \nSee, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work. They walk together down the lonely street. \nANGELA \nLook, I see terrible things every day. A mother drowns her baby. A ten-year-old shoots his father. But it's not demons, it's the evil that men do. Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another. They're not looking back so they don't see it. \nJOHN \nYou're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy. Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out. \nJOHN \nThen sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \nI don't believe in demons. \nJOHN \nYou should.   They believe in us. They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then blacks out. Both look up. The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT. Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING \nBRIGHT. \nJOHN \nWe should go... Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand -- \nJOHN \nFast. Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural WIND races toward them. John jerks her into action. They run towards the next light. It blinks out right when they reach it. They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd. \nEXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY \nThey make it through the gate, pass through an alley of overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek. They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER, fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths. John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum. A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination. Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them. \nANGELA \nWhat is that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn is just as surprised he's saying this -- \nJOHN \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN (V.O.) \nHeaven and Hell are right here, behind every wall, every face -- the world behind the world. It's crossing over that's the real trick. That's why most demons can only whisper in our ears. But even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare. \nINT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT \nHENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'. \nMAITRE D' \nSir, you need a reservation! But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's everywhere. He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish, pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes. In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly eating his meal. Balthazar. Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside gets thinner. He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her husband pulls her away. Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand. A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto Hennessey. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nBut the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here -- the ones that are half-human so they blend in... Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and starts toward the back EXIT. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN (V.O.) \n... just like those with the angel's touch living alongside of us. The half-breeds. That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that instant we get a brief glimpse of -- \nALTERNATE LOS ANGELES \nAn incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light. \nBACK TO SCENE \nBUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies. Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He leaves out the back exit. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nThey call it 'the Balance.' I call it hypocritical bullshit. \nINT. DINER \nJOHN \nSo when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul -- I deport their scaly ass right back to Hell. (takes a sip of tea) I don't get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement. \nANGELA \nSounds like you're trying to buy your way into Heaven. \nJOHN \nWell, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you? Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him. \nANGELA \nWhy you? I mean many go to Hell, why were you able to escape? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \n(sips tea) I don't know. \nANGELA \nGod has a plan for all of us. \nJOHN \nNot for me. John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at him -- finally -- \nANGELA \nIsabel saw things too. John looks up. Moment is lost when her CELLULAR RINGS. The cop in her reacts, flips it open. \nANGELA \nDetective Dodson here. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - LATER \nThe morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that chased Hennessey is just outside. \nWEISS (O.S.) \nSecurity Guard spotted him near the body, chased him out. We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is a complete shambles of fine dining -- \nWEISS \nHe comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow -- deflates like a fricken Macy's day balloon. -- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore is familiar now. John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be. John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he himself removed from his friend. That's even more crushing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nShit... (sympathetic) Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch... John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the fork wound. The blood is already drying over it. John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and grabs a melting ice cube. He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random stabbings. This is a shape. John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses. Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin. It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist. John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important. \nJOHN \n(to Hennessey) Rest in peace, Father. \nINT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES \nBut even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God. Angela sits back, letting that sink in. \nANGELA \nSo it's impossible. \nJOHN \nImpossible? Sure it's impossible. That's what makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn sits back, gut churning.       Angela's in detective mode. \nANGELA \nShe knew. That's why she killed herself. But it doesn't make sense... \nJOHN \nMakes sense to me. \nANGELA \nJohn, she sacrificed herself to beat him. John nods.     Your point? \nANGELA \nWhy is she in Hell? One of those rare moments where John has no answer. \nINT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY \nSomething small and SHINY is rolling down the alley.      It lands in the trough, spins round and round -- Beeman leans out to try and see what it is.      The silver object keeps spinning. He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face.      Then another. Book on his desk ignites in flame. \nEXT. 20 LANES - NIGHT \nSUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John rushes in. \nINT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY \nOnly a LOW HUM pervades the dead stillness of the alley. \nJOHN \nBeeman? John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's locked from the other side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \n(pounds on door) Hey, Beeman? Beeman?! The LOW HUM fluctuates -- sounds like a BUZZING. \nANGELA \nMaybe he's not here. \nJOHN \nHe's always here. Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices, turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots them as well. \nANGELA \nWhat? John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth. They approach the pin area of the center lane. The source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch trough is a solid mound of flies. John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the mound. \nJOHN \nOh Jesus, no -- He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged. Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears -- \nANGELA \n(stepping back) Oh God -- John goes ballistic, screams to the walls -- \nJOHN \nWho are you?! Answer me!! Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I summon you! He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating -- Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngela steps back in awe as the air around his outstretched arms begins to WARP -- to tear a faint hole from the bowling alley right into another world right here -- darker -- Hellish -- \nJOHN \nInto the light I command thee!! Into the light I -- John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela just how ill he really is. She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor. \nJOHN \n... this is my fault... I sent them in... I sent them right to their deaths... a damn one-man plague. \nANGELA \nJohn, you need a doctor. \nJOHN \nI've seen a goddamn doctor!! Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying. John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help. \nJOHN \nGet away from me!! \nWhy water? \nJOHN \nIt's the universal conduit. Lubricates the transition from one plane to another. Now ask me if there's water in Hell. John turns off the faucet. \nJOHN \nSit. Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself. When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck. \nJOHN \nNormally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course... \nANGELA \n(teeth chattering) What will I see? His eyes say it all.      Enough. \nJOHN \nLie down. \nANGELA \n(gesturing the depth) Lie down? \nJOHN \nYou have to be fully submerged. \nANGELA \nFor how long? \nJOHN \nAs long as it takes.     Here -- John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her. \nJOHN \nLast chance... (off her look) Take a deep one. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngela takes a deep breath, holds it. John pulls his hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted on his the entire time. \nANGELA'S POV \nA silent John ripples above.     His hand grips her arm, skin to skin. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAngela lies there and panic sets in. She starts to surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom, holds it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out. She can't hold her breath much longer. It's not working -- But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the current were ramping down. It slows to that dim half- light as -- JOHN'S EYES -- CLOSE.     A single blink. ANGELA is lying in now BOILING WATER, screaming for all of her life. Water muffles the sound but not the fury. Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard -- snapping out of the hold down bolts. John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman? Another SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS.     Water starts streaming onto the tile. John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the water -- her muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her mouth breaks the surface. She SLAMS hard against his chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his back -- leaving marks that might just scar. TUB GIVES WAY and the damn breaks. John and Angela go down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them both. ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling.      She looks up him, eyes filled with revelation. \nANGELA \nAll those people... so sad... John nods, helping her understand. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANGELA \n... I've always known... where the bad guys are... where to aim, when to duck... it's not luck... I've always known... Tears stream down her cheeks. John reaches out to touch her when her eyes CLAMP TIGHT in pain -- \nJOHN \nAngela? Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out. John pries himself from the tile, goes after her. \nINT. BEHIND THE ALLEY \nAngela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping water the entire way. John tries to keep up. \nANGELA \nIt was rolling toward him -- not a ball -- something smaller. Shiny. She stops, kneels to the floor.     John walks up to join her. Something glints in the catch trough. She reaches down, plucks it up and brings an odd COIN INTO VIEW -- John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar coin. \nJOHN \nBalthazar. \nINT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER \nBeeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets. Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also. \nCHRISTIAN RELICS \nare removed from a display cabinet. There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft of an iron cross -- all striking pieces individually but when twisted and locked together form a very imposing -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n-- HOLY SHOTGUN. \nHe swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and FIRES. BULLET leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his endless apartment, blasts the center out of -- A carton of Lucky Strikes. SETTLE ON the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away. \nANGELA (V.O.) \nCan you kill him? What about the Balance? \nINT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER \nJOHN \nNot really, no. \nBALTHAZAR \nYou can't cheat it this time... you're going back to Hell. \nJOHN \nTrue.   But you're not. John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat. Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses -- A Bible. \nBALTHAZAR \nWhat are you doing? \nJOHN \nI'm reading you your last rites. Balthazar reacts.      This isn't good. \nBALTHAZAR \nYour remedial incantations have no relevance to my kind. \nJOHN \nAren't you half human? Balthazar doesn't have to answer. \nJOHN \nYou see, that makes you eligible to be forgiven. You do know what it is to truly be forgiven? To be welcomed into the kingdom of God? Balthazar's worst nightmare. \nJOHN \nA demon in heaven -- love to be a fly on that wall... \nBALTHAZAR \nYou're not a priest, you have no power... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \n-- I escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do that?! Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs. \nJOHN \nJust tell me how Mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole. Balthazar isn't convinced. John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read -- \nJOHN \n'May the merciful God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins...' He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding authority. \nJOHN \n'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from -- ' \nBALTHAZAR \n-- It may not even work... \nJOHN \nHow?   How's he doing it?! Balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him. \nJOHN \n(bellowing out) 'Grant your child entry into thy kingdom in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Gh -- ' \nBALTHAZAR \n... Sangre de dio. John is stunned -- did he hear right?     Balthazar nods. \nJOHN \nHow? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBALTHAZAR \nWhat killed the Son of God will give birth to the son of the devil. John's mind races and he finally puts it together. \nJOHN \nHe's found the Spear. Balthazar's expression confirms it. \nCLOSE ON THE PRISONER'S RELIC \nIt's tucked between the folds of an AIRLINES blanket. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.) \n(over com) Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared for landing. Please make sure your seats are in their upright and locked position. Hand COMES IN, grips the relic.      WIDEN to see... \nINT. 747 - MID-FLIGHT \nPrisoner in an aisle seat, trying to keep calm. He looks behind him as if being watched. Just nerves again. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.) \nANGELA \nHe's down -- \nJOHN \nHe's not down.   Gimme your phone. Angela pulls out her cellular. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN \nA BRITISH COUPLE sit in the back of Chaz's taxi, staring out at the seedy side of town as if it were \"Wild Kingdom.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRITISH MAN \nThey mark their territory with graffiti instead of urine but they're still very much animals. British woman takes documentary photos. Chaz's CELLULAR RINGS over the BUZZ of a dispatch SCANNER. \nCHAZ \nThis is a private line -- John?! \nINTERCUT JOHN. \nJOHN \nChaz -- where are you?! \nCHAZ \nAh... 3rd and Figueroa. \nJOHN \nYou still got that Sedrallus? \nCHAZ \n(glancing to couple) Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right now, John. \nJOHN \nDammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save my ass here! \nCHAZ \n(under his breath) What else is new... \nJOHN \nRemember the Chalic of Enook incident? \nCHAZ \n(remembering) Oh no, no, no, not that, I just paid off this car! \nJOHN \nWest side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say... He checks the speedometer -- 90 mph. \nJOHN \n... 2 minutes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHAZ \nI'm five blocks away! (as John CLICKS off) John? John?! Ah... shit. Chaz downshifts, stops in cloud of dust -- \nCHAZ \nSorry, tour's over. The British start to argue. \nCHAZ \nOUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!! \nEXT. LA STREETS - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJohn heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the 3rd Street Bridge on the horizon. Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes. \nANGELA \nHe's back. Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours -- \nANGELA \nJohn, he's back and he's gaining! \nJOHN \nOf course he's gaining. John PUNCHES the GAS to the floor. \nEXT. 3RD STREET BRIDGE \nChaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge. He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway -- opens the glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a glass vial out of it. Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears the sound of a STRAINING ENGINE. Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it? \nCHAZ \nShit -- shit -- shit -- \nYou don't know her. \nMIDNITE \nAnd you do?   That would be a first. John swings open a STORAGE ROOM DOOR -- looks in at large-scale relics -- statues, props, etc. \nJOHN \nWhere's the chair? \nMIDNITE \nThe chair? \nJOHN \nThe delicate little number from Sing Sing? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMidnite just stares at him. \nMIDNITE \nIt's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool. \nJOHN \nI'll take my chances. \nMIDNITE \nAnd taint my establishment with your blood? I don't think so. \nJOHN \nMidnite -- \nMIDNITE \nYou know what that device can do to the ill-equipped -- \nJOHN \nMidnite -- \nMIDNITE \n-- and even in your most glorious days your brain was never your most powerful attribute -- \nJOHN \nWhere the hell is the chair, you dumb shit?! Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's seven feet. John knows he went too far. \nJOHN \nThat was the cancer talking, you know that, right? \nMIDNITE \n(holds up his finger) Once. John nods. \nINT. STORAGE AREA \nFluorescents flicker, REVEAL boxes of toilet tissue, cooking supplies, etc. And sitting in one corner by the huge power transformer is -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n-- the chair. Heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last time. Yeah, it's an electric chair right out of Sing Sing. \nJOHN \nWhat's in your bathroom, a Renoir? \nMIDNITE \nI have insurance issues. John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite blocks him. \nMIDNITE \nYou haven't surfed in decades. \nJOHN \nLike riding a bike... He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again. \nMIDNITE \nYou'll be lucky to reach an elemental plane. \nJOHN \nThen just increase the juice. John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him. \nMIDNITE \nIn your condition your body won't take much. \nJOHN \nI just need enough rope to find her. \nINT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM \nJohn's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of Midnite's grip. John gasps as he comes back -- nods to Midnite and finally -- \nJOHN \nRavenscar. The abandoned wing. He's in the boy. \nEXT. OVER HILLSIDE - FLYING - EVENING \nWINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital. \nINT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE - LATER \nMidnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a table. \nMIDNITE \nYou know these won't kill them. John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIDNITE \nYou probably won't even get close enough to use them. In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India. It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it dissolve. \nMIDNITE \nAnd it's not just the boy. John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small casting blocks. \nMIDNITE \nYou better worry about whoever's helping him. John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS. \nMIDNITE \nAs much as I admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations -- expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even for you. John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily. \nMIDNITE \nWell I suppose two fools can die just as easily as one. John almost smiles. \nMIDNITE \nHey, you think I'm trusting you to save the world? John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET. \nMIDNITE \nBut we're going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside. John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nThat ritual you do with the water, can you do more than one bottle at a time? Midnite raises an eyebrow. \nEXT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT \nThe motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit night. Vague figures move about near the emergency entrance. John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof. \nMIDNITE \n(sighs) Figures. \nINT. RAVENSCAR - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM \nTherapy machines look like medieval torture devices in the dimly-lit room. BARRY stands waist deep in a large hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor. His skin is pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon takes its toll. Especially on a child. His hands are below his waist and now we see they're lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water. Her face floats just above the surface as he buckles restraining straps around her wrists. \nINT. RAVENSCAR - ABANDONED WING \nFront glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly strut inside. Stop. HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd. This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers. Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are crowded in front of a set of double doors. Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys. John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot cop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nOkay -- let's cut the scratch and call it a night. Meeting's over. That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy. \nJOHN \nEllie? \nELLIE \nOh, John, you know how much I love it on this side. This was just an opportunity to make it permanent. \nJOHN \nYou think his son will be any different? He'll just turn this place into his own Hell and then where will you to party, Heaven? \nELLIE \nNo need to get nasty. \nJOHN \nNever bothered you before. \nELLIE \nINTERCUT WITH: \nMYSTERIOUS HIGH POV \nJohn coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides -- crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John puts a hand to her forehead -- \nJOHN \nEt separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes. \nJOHN/MIDNITE \nRescind from the flesh I command thee -- Amar natash bow basar! Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes and fingernails begins to fade. It's working... Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness. John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible force against the floor. Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words die on his lips. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEnraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large SHADOW on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object. He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves and slams those tattoos together -- \nJOHN \nInto the light I command thee! Into the light I command thee! It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes that familiar shape of WINGS. \nVOICE OF MAN (O.S.) \nYour ego is astounding. John strains to see the shadow become the real thing -- the majestic wings of an angel. \nJOHN \nGabriel? John is too weak to even be surprised anymore. \nJOHN \nFigures... Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand. \nJOHN \nAnd the wicked shall inherit the Earth. \nGABRIEL \nYou presume to judge me, John. \nJOHN \nBetrayal, murder, genocide?    Call me provincial. \nGABRIEL \nI am seeking to inspire humankind to be all that was intended. \nJOHN \nBy unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good thinking... Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGABRIEL \nYou've had it too easy for too long. \nJOHN \nSo what's a few thousand years of pain, right? \nGABRIEL \nYou never deserved to be blessed. You've all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, never really appreciating the gift you were given so freely -- unconditional love from your creator. \nJOHN \nAnd that just bugs the shit out of you. \nGABRIEL \nIt's not your fault. Like the animals you are, you never learn unless sufficiently prodded. Pleasure has no lasting effect. But subject you to pain, unpleasantness -- suffering -- and you will take notice, you will fight to overcome, to earn your redemption. That is when you're at your best. Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again. \nJOHN \nYou're trying to teach us a lesson? \nGABRIEL \nNo, I'm giving you the chance to rise above the suffering and truly earn the love of God. (a beat) The road to salvation begins tonight. Right now. John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the Spear in his hand. He makes a break for it. Gabriel's wings beat once. The GUST BLOWS John through the double doors, back into the -- \nCORRIDOR \n-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses. \nPHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM \nGabriel turns back to Angela. He approaches her -- his rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her -- pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula. \nCORRIDOR - JOHN \ncan't even stand, let alone save the girl.     Or humanity. It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and die. But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long time. \nJOHN \n(whispering) ... I know I'm not one of your favorites... I'm not even allowed in your house these days... but I could use a little attention... John waits for nothing. His body crumples, his cheek landing flat against the tile. Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. As he stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea. \nPHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S EYES \nJOHN \nHe has the Spear of Destiny. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSatan didn't know that.     Now he's concerned.     He studies this dying man. \nSATAN \nThis is another one of your cons. \nJOHN \nGo look for yourself... Satan is still suspicious. \nJOHN \nYou've waited twenty years for me, what's another twenty seconds? Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time -- \nPHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - THE SPEAR \nis about to be thrust into Angela's chest. \nSATAN (O.S.) \nGabriel? Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room. Gabriel reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and Gabriel has now pierced dead air. Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John did. She struggles and the demon inside appears -- reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on the floor. Hideous. The real MAMMON. \nSATAN \nSay goodbye to the sun -- both of you. Mammon SHRIEKS and Gabriel's beautiful wings ignite in \nFLAME -- \nGABRIEL \nNo!!!!!!!! \nCORRIDOR - JOHN \nis rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building to its foundation. A moment later -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSatan is back. John looks up, gives him that look -- you owe me. Satan hates admitting it but knows it's true. \nSATAN \nSo... what do you want?   An extension? John shakes his head, can barely utter a sound... \nJOHN \nIsabel... \nSATAN \nWhat about her? \nJOHN \n... let her... go home... \nSATAN \nYou would give up your life so she could go to Heaven? John manages a nod... \nSATAN \nFine. (closes, opens eyes) It's done. \nINT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM \nANGELA gasps -- her first real breath's a strain. Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her eyes -- \nEXT. THAT GORGEOUS SKY \nStretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings, penduluming up in SLOW MOTION. Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing. Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for what seems so close... so close... Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky. \nSATAN (V.O.) \nTime to go. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nJohn relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. Satan takes his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try as he might, he can't budge John an inch. And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if weightless, begins to rise toward something above. No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the embrace of God. Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE -- \nSATAN \nThe sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE \nBELONGS TO ME!! \nJohn's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan, the middle finger fully extended. Final straw. Satan goes rabid -- turns to PURE ENERGY for a split second. His hands remain on fire. \nSATAN \nYou will live, John Constantine, you will live so you'll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in Hell. You will live! Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's body -- John screams in agony. Satan tears through his tissue -- collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final blood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over -- \nINT./EXT. RAVENSCAR \n-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills beyond. \n", "test1_input": "JOHN \nAmar natash bow basar -- Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon inside were trying to burst right through. John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances to Hennessey. What the hell? MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM. John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room. \nJOHN \nLift it.   Over the bed.   Up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over him. \nJOHN \nHennessey, tie it off -- Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above him. \nJOHN \nNow close your eyes -- all of you -- and whatever happens -- do not look into the mirror. The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the weight. \nJOHN \nAmar natash bow basar! -- rescind from the flesh I command thee! Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young body all out of proportion. John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young girl in there, but something else. The surface of the mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to look -- \nJOHN \nNo! Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep. \nHENNESSEY \nJohn?! \nJOHN \n(looking into mirror) Not yet! John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting off her air supply. Question is, who's going to pass out first? Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. She goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to death. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nLook!   Look at me! But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction -- \nJOHN \nGoddamit -- look! -- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically. \nJOHN \nSmile pretty you vain prick. The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in. MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths -- \nJOHN \nNow, Hennessey. Now! Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended \nFINGER. \nJOHN \nFor your boss. Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion. Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood -- \nJOHN \nNo you don't. John jumps up and helps push the mirror free. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HUGE MIRROR \nFalls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON the taxi's hood. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCHAZ \nSHIT! \nDemon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air. The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city beyond. Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet. \nINT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJeanie GASPS -- takes her first breath as a child again. And CRIES. Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. Note the girl's fingernails. No longer black. John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still burning. Takes a drag. He pushes past Hennessey who is approaching the mother. \nHENNESSEY \nNow about the fee... John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance. He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick. This image is repeated over and over. John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - LATER \nHennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch them, shake their hands. A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished veneer. This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here. He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers. JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something. No one there. Balthazar is gone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause. \nHENNESSEY \nThank you.     Yes... Gracias... \nJOHN \n", "test1_true": "INT. FOYER \nJohn and Hennessey stop near the front entrance.      John rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck. \nHENNESSEY \nI know, I know, but I didn't think she was really possessed, not like that. \nJOHN \nI'm not back an hour and you drag me into -- \nHENNESSEY \n-- Don't be mad, John, don't be -- John rummages through his coat pockets -- \nHENNESSEY \nOn the left side. John keeps searching. \nHENNESSEY \nVest pocket. John rips his smokes from the left vest pocket -- \nJOHN \nDon't do that shit on me -- \nHENNESSEY \nSorry, sorry.    Here, you can have half. Hennessey starts to divvy the cash but John snatches the hat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nI should take it all, save you from yourself. He gestures that bagged BOTTLE in Hennessey's jacket. \nHENNESSEY \nIt keeps them out, so I can sleep. Please, John, I need to sleep. John stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips a few bills from the wad and hands them over. Hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to follow. John simply holds up a hand. Hennessey stops, watches John walk out. Alone. \nEXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT \nJohn turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from the taxi's hood. \nJOHN \nI told you to move it. \nCHAZ \nWell maybe if you had told me you were dropping a three-hundred pound mirror with a pissed-off demon in it I would have moved it further. Chaz slams the hood.      They slide into the car. \nCHAZ \nWell? \nJOHN \nWell what? Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills. \nCHAZ \nShouldn't have cut your stay in the land of enlightenment. You were so close to growing a conscience. John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and sits back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN \nLos Angeles... He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled. \nJOHN \nNever ceases to entertain. Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs. \nEXT. THE SKY \nOne of those perfect days. With perfect clouds. So clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven. Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings. For a moment they're suspended against that incredible sky. Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to Earth. \nMAN (V.O.) \nYou still with me? \nINT. SUBWAY - DAY \nANGELA'S (30) weary eyes open. She's on her belly hidden between track ties and shadows even deeper. Grips a police-issue revolver tight. She's pinned down, unable to move. \nANGELA \nYeah... The MAN is thirty feet down the same track. Their VOICES ECHO off the curved walls, come from everywhere. How either of these two got here isn't important.      Who will get out is. \nMAN (O.S.) \nSo what's next, Detective?   We gonna do a full marathon? Intermittent RADIO CHATTER buzzes from Angela's WALKIE- TALKIE. You get the sense Angela is not alone in here. \nANGELA \nPut your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 1611, "test2_input": "JOHN \n(deadpan) Why, do you have any? John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER. \nJOHN \nI need you to step outside now. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAngela wants to stay. \nJOHN \nAngela?   Please. Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a moment where animal and man seem to connect. The water around John's feet begins to BOIL. ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on its way to latch. Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers, is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John has now crossed over into -- \nAPARTMENT IN HELL \nSame layout, different decorator. John takes a deep, raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed structure in Beirut. Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not quite night. John steps over the crumbling wall into -- \nEXT. HELL LOS ANGELES \nJohn walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long- forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE penetrates the silence. \nJOHN \nIs she here? On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut through the putrid brown haze. \nJOHN \nIs she here?! His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJohn cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief. \nJOHN \nIS SHE HERE?! \nThat low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape, rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this isn't a safe place for the living. \nJOHN \nIt's a simple question!    Is she here or not?!! John suddenly locks on something far off. On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows she's looking right at him. \nJOHN \nIsabel? She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness. \nINT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY \nIn that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES -- \nJOHN (O.S.) \n(weakly) Angela... come back in... Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nJohn sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him. \nANGELA \nJohn?     What happened? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm -- reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name \"ISABEL DODSON\" is typed on it. Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight -- tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor. John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder. The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes herself. \nANGELA \nHow?   How did you do this...? John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails. \nINT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT \nBody drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type. Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room again, makes sure he's still alone. He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead. Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last. Hennessey shudders. This is it. He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void -- \nJOHN (V.O.) \nWhen I was a kid, I saw things... \nFLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY \nA TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nThings I wasn't supposed to. The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are dug into the ground. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWAITRESS (O.S.) \nCoffee? Young John looks up toward the voice -- \nINT. DINER - NIGHT (PRESENT) \n", "test2_true": "JOHN \nTea. She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the table by the window. \nJOHN \nMy parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a priest. I was in four different institutions by the time I was eighteen. Angela notes him rubbing his wrist. \nJOHN \nThe last place they put me was run by a church... A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO... \nFLASHBACK - INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - HALLWAY \nThe Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nThe revered Father made the brilliant deduction that I was possessed, said I needed to be exorcised... \nINT. ROOM - HIGH ANGLE \nThe Doctor runs in. Sees the revered Father below, leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams at them all. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nIt was like someone trying to pull teeth that weren't there. Young John clamps his eyes shut tight. \nINT. DINER - JOHN (PRESENT) \nPresent-day John does the same, remembering the pain. \nJOHN \nSo I took things into my own hands and I found a way out. \nANGELA \nYou attempted suicide. John sees she's looking at his wrist. The hint of a jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve. \nJOHN \nI never attempt anything. John's reflection in the window becomes -- \nFLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN \nkneeling with a pair off scissors.     He's inside a... \nINT. CLASSROOM \nTeenage John looks up at a room filled with people from all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in school chairs and wait for John to do the deed. He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR -- \nINT. DINER (PRESENT) \nANGELA \nBut you're still here.    Alive. \nJOHN \nNot my doing. His chest suddenly HEAVES forward -- and we're on... \nFLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN \nas he's jolted by DEFIB PADS.     He's in the back of a... \nINT. AMBULANCE - MOVING \nParamedics are soaked in sweat. One looks a bit like a young Dr. Archer. Heart monitor is FLAT LINE. There's little hope. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES \nThe ambulance moves through a city that is transforming. From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nOfficially I was dead for seven minutes. But believe me, seven minutes in Hell is a lifetime. Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN. \nINT. AMBULANCE \nFLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly SPIKES with a pulse -- \nINT. MORGUE (PRESENT) \nHennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic. His eyes fix on Isabel's wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is back. Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed. He rushes out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming in. \nSECURITY GUARD \nHey, what're you doing in here? Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer partially open. He walks over, pulls it out further -- sees the plastic cut away. Jesus. The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist. \nJOHN (V.O.) \nWhen I returned I didn't just see demons anymore, I could do the one thing they couldn't -- come and go as I please. \nEXT. MORGUE - HENNESSEY \nruns as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the receiver, punches numbers as fast as he can.

When you'd spend every waking hour with each other. You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd cry. \nANGELA \nThat was a long time ago... \nJOHN \nThat kind of bond doesn't just disappear. \nANGELA \nThere's nothing here. Angela seems unbalanced.     John gets more aggressive. \nJOHN \nShe planned her death in this room, she thought it up right where you're standing -- Angela backs away.

Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating. John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees -- \nANGELA \nThe tree. \nEXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT \nA lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard. John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.   Finally sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela. She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees. That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his hand. But this time there's more. \nANGELA \n(trying to rationalize) There must have been a tree in our backyard... when we were kids... John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything.

John's face goes pale -- \nJOHN \nI need a church. \nINT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER \nSeveral families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor comforts a man and wife. John and Angela slip through, head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall. They whisper. \nJOHN \nCorinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of Ethenius. It's like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned. \nANGELA \nThere's a difference? \nJOHN \nDepends on which side of the fence you're standing. John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl of holy water near the altar. \nANGELA \nSo why haven't I seen this book before? \n", "test3_true": "Because it doesn't exist here on this side. John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to \nBOIL -- \nANGELA (O.S.) \nWhat do you mean -- Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela mid-question and the room in that dim half-light. John turns and is inside -- \nSAME CHAPEL - HELL \nThe epitome of blasphemy -- A church in Hell. Only they don't worship God in here. And that's not Christ on the cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate black. John is now facing books with completely different markings. He searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow down the walls, getting closer to John with each heartbeat. He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes -- \nREGULAR CHAPEL \nANGELA \n-- not here on this side? John turns, covered in sweat. He's holding a book she's never seen, is already flipping through it. \nANGELA \nWhere did that come from? \nJOHN \n(stopping to read) 13:29. 13:30 -- Here... Corinthians 14:01...

The narrow alley of machines stretches out behind him. He stares into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page folded a thousand times. Turns another page. \nBOWLING AREA \nAmazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness, the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of beasts. \nBEEMAN (O.S.) \nOh my... \nBEHIND THE LANES \nBeeman has stopped turning pages. That's because he's now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below are ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body. But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling. A figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly welcoming the beast into this world. \nBEEMAN \nThis is not good... BOWLING BALL hits a lane.     Beeman spins to the sound. BALL ROLLS round and round, closer and closer until it CLANGS dead against the back wall of one of the lanes. Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin machines. He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the machinery and peeks out the pin hole. \nBEEMAN \nJohn? \nEXT.

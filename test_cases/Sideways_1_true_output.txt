Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp. 
MILES Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid. 
JACK I don't know. Tastes okay to me. (looking at the tasting sheet) Hey, they got a reserve pinot. 
MILES Let me use your phone. 
JACK (handing it over) What's up? 
MILES I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn. 
EXT. LARGE WINERY - DAY 
Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone to his ear. 
ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE) Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office. 
MILES Hi, it's Miles. 
ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE) Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can get her. (a moment later) You're in luck. I'll put you through. 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) Miles. 
MILES Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client. 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) How's the trip? 
MILES Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word? 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning. 
MILES And? 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call. 
MILES Huh. 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) I'm sorry, Miles. (off his silence) So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing. 
Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack. 
EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT 
Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending vertiginously across a great CHASM. 
EXT. LARGE WINERY - BACK AGAIN 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) Are you there? Miles? 
MILES Yeah, I'm here. 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. (loudly, to her assistant) Tell him I'll call back. 
MILES So I guess that's it. 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged. 
MOMENTS LATER -- 
Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clich√©s of consolation continue in his head. 
EVELYN (ON THE PHONE) Just hang in there, and who knows? After you get something else published, we can revisit this one. And next time we can try a different title. 
Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening. 
INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY 
Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station. He pushes his way to front. 
The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it back, immediately extending his glass for more. 
MILES Hit me again. 
The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles holds out his glass. 
MILES Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it. 
POURER This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar. 
Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table. 
MILES Just give me a full goddamn pour. 
The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice. 
Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond. 
POURER Sir, what are you doing? 
MILES I told you I need a drink. 
POURER Then buy a bottle and go outside. 
The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink. 
POURER Put the glass down. 
In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back. 
POURER You're going to have to leave, sir.

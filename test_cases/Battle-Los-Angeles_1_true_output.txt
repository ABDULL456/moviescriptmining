HECTOR People always say that. "He's a hero." 
(BEAT) No one even knows what a hero is. 
SGT. NANTZ Your dad was a hero. Hector just stares back. 
SGT. NANTZ He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that freeway. Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes between them... One man died so another could live... 
SGT. NANTZ You save a marine under fire, you get a medal, y'know. Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it. 
SGT. NANTZ This is our medallion. It's yours. For your dad. 
(SMILES) You're 2/5 now, Hector. Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to the 2/5 MOTTO on it: 
HECTOR What's that mean, "retreat hell?" 
SGT. NANTZ During World War I, an officer from our regiment was ordered to retreat. He said, "Retreat? Hell, we just got here!" Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now. Harris calls out: 
CPL. HARRIS We're secure, sergeant. 
Nantz stands on this, addresses the marines: 
SGT. NANTZ Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns, Adukwu stay with the civilians. The rest of us, let's move. Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder. 
SGT. NANTZ I'll be right back. 
EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT RUNWAY - MINUTES LATER 
Black plumes of SMOKE fill the night sky as Nantz and his men head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens. The tarmac is a smoldering WASTELAND: Empty, bombed-out buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles litter the runways. Fires crackle. As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo. IMLAY whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines he searches. 
PVT. IMLAY Sorry, bro. He moves on to another fallen marine, searching. 
PVT. IMLAY Sorry, bro. Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead marine. Then looking up, he sees... 
A LAV-25 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. INTACT. Nantz moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and the marines look up. They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives the LAV an excited once-over. 
CPL. STAVROU Looks like it just rolled off the goddamn assembly line! 
PVT. IMLAY Good job, Sergeant! 
SGT. NANTZ 
(TO STAVROU) Can you drive this thing? 
CPL. STAVROU Hell, if it's got an engine, sergeant, I can drive it. 
SGT. NANTZ Good. Get it running. 
CPL. CORREGGIO Seems like vehicles are targets...

AGNETE (CONT'D) They said the same thing about Kony in the beginning. 
EXT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK 
Sam sitting outside his tukul alone, tearing open an airmail package and pulling out another VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it into his videocamera, hits play -- 
ON THE SMALL SCREEN we see a school production... children dressed in costumes shuffling across the stage... lines being spoken by rote...and then the awkward entrance of Paige speaking her lines... but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds heartache... the distance from his family... from their innocence... simply too great to bear in this moment... 
... and then he hears giggling... and he realizes two young orphan BOYS have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his shoulder... and Sam holds it up so they can see better and now more children gather around -- maybe 10 or 15 kids -- pointing at the small screen... giggling and chatting in Arabic... 
ORPHAN #1 (ARABIC) Look at their shoes... 
ORPHAN #2 (ARABIC) They look silly... 
ORPHAN #1 (ARABIC) This is how Americans dance? 
ORPHAN #2 (ARABIC) Their dancing is terrible! 
The children laughing hysterically... and for an instant Sam is swept out of his melancholy by their sweet enjoyment... 
... and then Sam sees Deng and Nineteen approaching quickly... 
SAM What's goin on? 
DENG An LRA convoy has moved north over the border. They're heading for Ed Duim. 
SAM That's where they sell em on the black market, ain't it? 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - NIGHT 
A moonless night... and we see headlights piercing this blackness... bouncing down a singletrack road... we are... 
INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Deng behind the wheel driving -- Sam in the passenger seat -- Marco, Nineteen, and a third SPLA SOLDIER jammed in the back -- 
DENG Look... 
Far ahead we see three sets of HEADLIGHTS coming towards us on the road -- just bouncing white dots on the horizon -- and silently they begin to check their mags and weapons -- preparing for battle -- 
-- and the headlights get closer -- Deng not slowing down -- and we realize we are on a collision course with this convoy -- and finally we see MUZZLE FLASHES in the distance -- and -- 
THUNK!, THUNK!, THUNK! 
Machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck -- 
SAM Let's go! 
Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives -- leveling their AK's and firing -- 
KRAKAKAKAKAK! KRAKAKAKAKAK! 
And now the approaching convoy LIGHTS UP with RETURN FIRE! -- Sam and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back -- Deng stepping on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of "chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter in scene #29) -- 
-- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore -- BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck -- SAM AND NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE -- THE SOUND DEAFENING -- headlights blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness - - only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as these trucks slam towards each other -- and finally -- 
THE LRA CONVOY CAREENS OFF THE ROAD AND BOTTOMS OUT IN A DITCH 
Deng skidding to a stop as Sam, Nineteen, and the third SPLA SOLDIER pile out of the truck -- firing and advancing on the caravan by foot. 
EXT. DITCH - SIDE OF DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
Rebels jumping out of their disabled trucks -- Sam and his men flanking them -- blasting one of the trucks until the engine bursts into flames -- cutting down the rebels before they even knew what hit them. And then there's a great stillness. The quiet of death... 
... Sam coming out of the blackness with his AK leveled... moving toward the flaming wreckage of the caravan... Deng, Nineteen, and Marco moving to each rebel body... making sure they're dead. 
NINETEEN Clear! 
Sam and Deng moving to the back of the Transport Truck... 
SAM Bring me a flashlight. 
Marco hustling up with a spotlight -- Sam switching it on as Deng rips the canvas back and we see -- 
TWENTY THREE CHILDREN IN THE BACK OF THIS TRANSPORT TRUCK 
Boys and girls... none of them older than twelve... tied together with rope... emaciated... terrified... in very bad shape. 
MARCO (ARABIC) The front axle is broken... this truck won't drive. 
SAM What'd he say? 
DENG The truck is too damaged to move. (meaning the children) We don't have room for them all, Preacher. 
The implication of this hitting Sam, his mind reeling, turning to Nineteen... 
SAM Bring our truck up here and shine them lights on us. (TO DENG) Pull everyone of them kids outta there. 
DENG (to soldiers, Arabic) Bring the children out... 
Deng and Marco helping the children out... one-by-one... untying them... 
SAM Put em right here... real easy... 
DENG (ARABIC) Put them together here... gently... 
And now Nineteen pulls up in the SUV, lighting up the children.

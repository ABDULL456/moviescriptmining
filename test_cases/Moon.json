{"train": "MOON \nWritten by \nNathan Parker \nStory by \nDuncan Jones \nNovember, 2007 \nHelium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and blown through space by solar winds. \nIt plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as the solution to humanity's future energy needs. \nThere is one major problem... \nHelium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does, however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural satellite: \nThe Moon. \nShould we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and bring the precious gas back to Earth... \nIN THE BLACK: \nWe hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING. Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar, we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and then \nCUT TO: \n1   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      1 \nThe sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see in most gyms across the world. Running on it: SAM BELL, mid thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes. \nSam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. He lunges for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face as he runs. \nWe see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: A gray, powdery landscape stretching beneath a BLACK SKY. \nCUT TO: \n2   EXT. MOON -- MORNING                                          2 \nAerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface. \nDesolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place makes Antarctica look like Tokyo. \nAnd utter silence. \nEventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN towards it -- \nTITLE CARD: \"MINING BASE SELENE. CREW: 1.\" \nCUT TO: \n3   INT. BATHROOM\\SHOWER -- MORNING                               3 \nSam takes a shower, treading in a tight circle beneath the nozzle, eyes closed, hot water blasting his face. \n4   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               4 \nHis hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS UNIT, dressed in a \"Lunar Industries\" boiler suit, a zip up the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins to record a message. \nSAM Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary. \nAs Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the mining base. Beginning with: \n5   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       5 \nThis is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering digital displays. \nSAM (V.O.) Today begins my 154th week on Selene. I officially have two weeks to go before I climb into that Return Vehicle... \n6   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                           6 \nBack with Sam at the Comms Unit as he wraps up the message. \nSAM Please kiss Eve for me. And tell her daddy will only be away a little longer -- seventeen days longer, approximately. I love you both dearly. Bye. \nAnd he sends the message. \nCUT TO: \n14   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 14 \nThe main corridor connecting the different rooms. We've seen everything there is to see now. The base is small. Confined. Claustrophobic. It is easy to imagine how someone could crack up here. \nSam leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor. \n15   INT. REC ROOM                                                 15 \nA state of the art robot, a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as \"GERTY\" -- is preparing Sam's breakfast. \nGerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal rail that runs throughout the base. He has a readout screen that perpetually spews data. His hands resemble pincers, but are perfectly nimble. \nFor the purposes of helping run the base and looking after Sam, Gerty is as good as human, if not better. \nSam enters. \nSAM Morning, Gerty. \nGERTY Morning, Sam. How are you today? \nSAM Fine. Fine. You? \nGERTY I'm very well. How's your headache? \nSAM Much better, thanks, pal. \nSam treats Gerty more like a person than a robot. Whether this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation for company isn't clear just yet. \nNote: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e. Monotone) but he is friendly enough. \nSam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static - - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks. We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on, on some random American station -- an old weather report: \nVOICE ON RADIO ...it's a hot one on the East Coast, temperatures soaring to a high of ninety three degrees in New York City -- \nThey zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing Sam's breakfast, working as a team. \nCUT TO: \n16   EXT. MOON                                                     16 \nWe take in the whole Moon at once. Gray, colorless, eerie. From this distance the surface resembling Plaster of Paris. \n17   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                                17 \nSam sits before Selene's main computer, known as THE OLD MAN. Data flickering off Sam's face. He is making a log entry. A CLOCK is running on the monitor. \nSAM 8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. All Harvesters running smoothly this morning. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles; Mark 16.8 miles... \nSam continues with his entry while we \nCUT TO: \n18   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                           18 \nGerty is selecting food for the up-coming week, stacking ready-meals on a small fork-lift buggy. \nCUT TO: \n19   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      19 \nA RED LIGHT \nPulsing rapidly. The \"ping-ping-ping\" of an alarm. \nBOARD \nSam is loading the Cargo Container into the base's MAGLEV LAUNCHER. He works with a sense of routine, far away, preoccupied. \nAll of a sudden Sam STOPS. He has the feeling someone is standing behind him. He slowly turns. \nA GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him. She is perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. A yellow dress. Long, wheat-colored hair. Freckles. At once beautiful and haunting. \nSam gets the FRIGHT of his life. He FLIES against the wall. \nWIDEN to reveal Sam and the Girl facing off. Sam POP-EYED and SHAKING. The Girl IMMOBILE, arms at her sides, head tilted ever so slightly to one side. \nThe Cargo Container is sent hurtling through space. A TERRIFIC BLAST. It distracts Sam's attention, breaks his stare... \nAnd just like that, the Girl is gone. Sam is just staring at an empty doorway. Nothing there. \nSam is baffled. Had to be his imagination. Had to be. After a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues working. \nCUT TO: \n29   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                         29 \nGerty is cutting Sam's hair. \nSam sitting back in a chair, barber shop style, while the robot snip-snip-snips away with a pair of scissors. Sam is gently squeezing a STRESS BALL in his right hand. \nGERTY Sam, is everything okay? \nSAM Everything's fine, Gerty. \nFor a moment there is no sound but the snipping scissors, reminiscent of keys snapping on a typewriter. Then: \nSAM (CONT'D) Why do you ask? \nGERTY You don't seem like yourself today. \nSam frowns, contemplative. For a moment we think he is going to tell Gerty about the Girl he saw earlier -- or imagined he saw. But he goes with something different. \nSAM It's Tess. \nGERTY Has something happened? \nSAM No, not exactly. \nGerty stops cutting, lowers the scissors. \nGERTY Sam, what is it? \nSAM Something doesn't feel right, that's all. \nA beat. Sam's fingers twitching around the red stress ball, squeezing harder. \nGERTY Sam, it might help to talk about it. \nSam decides to come clean. \nSAM Tess isn't responding to things. \nGERTY Tess isn't responding to things? \nSAM Right. \nGERTY What kind of things? \nSAM (a beat) A couple of weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to go on vacation when I get back, and that I was thinking of either Mexico or Hawaii. (MORE) \nSAM (CONT'D) Tess never said anything about it. Three messages she's sent me since...and she's never once mentioned the vacation. \nGERTY Im sure she can't wait, Sam. \nSAM That's not the point. This is someone who lives for vacations and travelling. I thought she'd jump at the chance for us to go away -- with Eve, of course -- we'd take Eve. \nGERTY Perhaps Tess didn't receive the message? \nSAM (as if anticipating Gerty's comment) But this isn't the only time it's happened, Gerty. When I asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that -- I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery -- nothing. Had her brother got the position at the University? Nothing. Nothing. \nSam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his superiors, OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON, a purposeful looking woman in charge and her earnest second. \nThe two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team. At times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical. \nOvermeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while, but even so, there is a practised casualness to the repartee. It's a professional friendliness on Overmeyers part, no more and for Thompson it's merely an eagerness to be involved. \nOVERMEYERS Delighted to hear about the latest shipment, Sam. \nTHOMPSON According to Albatross 90 it should be landing off the California Coast within the next three days. \nOVERMEYERS Now in response to your question about the communications equipment, the news is not good. \nTHOMPSON Sam, those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially thought -- \nOVERMEYERS Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time. It's a significant operation. \nTHOMPSON And what with the Jupiter Program hemorrhaging money -- \nSam curses to himself. \nOVERMEYERS Lunar doesn't have the budget it once did, Sam, you know that. \nTHOMPSON Even the coffee machine down in the Hub has been broken since I don't know when -- \nOVERMEYERS We have to go to Genesis 3 just to get a decent cup of coffee, Sam. Genesis 3. That's three buildings over. \nTHOMPSON We're hoping to get the live feed up and running by the Fall. The good news is you'll be home by then, Sam. \nOVERMEYERS You only have two weeks to go! Congrat-- \nSam shuts off the message before Overmeyers can pipe out his last line. \nSam sits before the dead screen -- eyes closed -- taking a succession of DEEP BREATHS. \nCUT TO: \n34   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                         34 \nSam playing Ping-Pong. He has folded up the second half of the table and is using it as a wall. The sound is rapid and rhythmic: ca-cluck ca-cluck ca-cluck. Sam taking his FRUSTRATION out on the little white ball. \nCUT TO: \n35   INT. BATHROOM -- DAY                                         35 \nSam stands before the toilet urinating. Rather ironically he is whistling I'm Walking on Sunshine -- focussed ahead at his reflection in the mirror -- angling his face, admiring his haircut, his beard. \nThen he looks down to flush the toilet and his WHISTLING abruptly STOPS. \n36   INT. BATHROOM\\TOILET                                         36 \nIt looks like someone just poured a glass of CRANBERRY JUICE into the toilet bowl. Literally. The red urine clouding the water like a squirt of octopus ink. Yeah, Sam just pissed blood. \nThere is a \"PING!\" and Gerty's voice crackles from the intercom. \nGERTY'S VOICE Sam, a transmission has arrived from your wife. \nSam reaches over and presses the INTERCOM BUTTON. \nSAM Be right there. \nAnd he flushes the toilet. \nCUT TO: \n37   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       37 \nSam sitting before the monitor. He hits the \"PLAY\" button, begins watching the message. \nON THE MONITOR: Tess is sitting in a living room talking to Sam. Tess has a sweet voice, she sounds grounded, like she's got a head on her shoulders. \nTESS Hi Sam. It's me. How are you? (a beat) I got your last message, it was really great to hear your voice. I know you've been really lonely up there, but in a lot of ways it's been good for you, I think. I hope you don't mind me saying that. I'm proud of you. (a beat) Hey, someone's got something to say. \nA WOMAN, possibly a nanny or some form of hired help, swings a LITTLE GIRL into Tess's arms. This is EVE, Sam and Tess's daughter. \nAfter a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room to make some tea. The water has just boiled. \nAs Sam is about to pour the boiling water, tea kettle in hand, he glances across the Rec Room and sees: \nThe Girl. She's taken Sam's chair before the model. She is motionless, staring down at the model like she recognizes one of the little figures walking the tiny streets. \nSam calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move towards the Girl, slowly, cautiously, like he wants to sneak up on her. \nSam walks right up to the Girl and reaches out his hand... \nSAM \nAnd then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty. She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room -- apparently he imagined it all. \nSam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand. \nSimultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor. \nSam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time: \"Shit, piss, fuck...\" \nCUT TO: \n42   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      42 \nSam sits in a chair as Gerty tends to his scolded left hand. It's a nasty burn. \nSAM I'm going to feel that for a while, aren't I, Gerty? (then) Damn it. \nGerty applies a translucent balm to the burn. \nGERTY Sam, can I ask how it happened? \nSAM I told you, I saw something on the TV and spilled boiling water on my hand. \nGERTY You saw something on the TV? \nSAM (a touch petulant) Yeah, something on the TV distracted me, Gerty, what's wrong with that? \nA pause. Gerty is wrapping Sam's hand with a bandage. \nGERTY Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on. \nGerty has caught him out. Sam knows it. \nGERTY (CONT'D) Perhaps you were imagining things? \nGerty has hit the nail on the head, in a way that makes Sam feel a little uneasy. Is there something Gerty knows that Sam doesn't? \nCUT TO: \n43   INT. THE SLEEPING QUARTERS -- NIGHT                           43 \nSam asleep in bed. \n44   SAM'S DREAM                                                   44 \nSam making love to Tess. We remain very close to their bodies in bed. The background a blur. No sound. It's all flesh and white sheets. Sensual, delicate, intense. We feel almost intrusive watching. \n45   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- MORNING                             45 \nSam wakes up and lunges across the bed to shut off his alarm clock. We notice a WHITE BANDAGE on the hand that he scolded. \nAfterwards: Sam lies back, watching the ceiling, groggy, reflective, still surfacing from his dream. \nAnd then OVER THIS: The sound from the opening of the film, THE TREADMILL, and we \nCUT TO: \n46   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      46 \nSam on his morning run. \n47   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING/LATER                                47 \nFor a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester, clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester, focussed on the Girl. \nON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing Sam to lose control. \nThe steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the Harvester, DEVOURED. \nThe Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE, resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG, BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL. \nWIDE SHOT: Silence. The Harvester stationary. The Rover caught beneath it. \nNo sign of the Girl. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nSilence. Hold it for five seconds and then \n51   A BLUR                                                       51 \nEyelids fluttering, bright light, at first broken up, filtered, as if viewed through a Kaleidoscope. Slowly shapes and impressions begin to form and we know where we are. \nIt's the Infirmary. \n52   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        52 \nA CLEAN SHAVEN and drugged-up Sam is sitting up in bed, propped with a pillow. Sam doesn't have a scratch on his face, but has clearly been through a terrifying ordeal. \nGerty is bedside. \nSAM Where am I? \nGERTY Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident. \nSam looks bewildered -- he desperately racks his brain, trying to locate the memory. \nGERTY (CONT'D) Do you remember what happened? \nSAM No. (a beat) I don't remember a thing. \nSam just stares back at Gerty, not so much as a flicker of recognition. \nGERTY Do you remember me? \nSAM Yes, of course I remember you, Gerty. \nGERTY That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again. (a beat) I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests. \nA pause. Sam taking it all in. Eventually: \nSAM How long have I been out? \nGERTY Not long. Sam, go back to sleep. You're still very tired. We can talk later. \nSam closes his eyes, sinking deeper into his pillow. \nCUT TO: \n53   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      53 \nSam asleep in bed. Gerty is scanning his head with a small instrument resembling a camcorder. \nThere are READOUTS on a monitor showing blood flow, oxygen levels and glucose metabolism in the tissues of Sam's brain. \nCUT TO: \n54   EXT. MOON --   DAY                                           54 \nLUKE, one of the Harvesters, crossing the lunar landscape at HALF SPEED. \n55   INT. INFIRMARY                                               55 \nSam wakes up from an extended nap. He thrusts his fists into his eyes like a child, yawns ferociously. \nSam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor: \nSAM Gerty! Get over here! Quickly! \nGerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down the corridor. \nGERTY What happened? \nSAM Don't know -- Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a look. \nGERTY There is no damage to the exterior shell. \nSAM It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh? \nGERTY Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside. \nSAM Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok? \nThe robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily repair the damage Sam has done. Finally: \nGERTY Okay, Sam. \nThe \"Exit Doors\" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he immediately takes off down the corridor -- \n74   INT. CHANGING AREA                                            74 \nSam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit and scrambles into it. \n75   INT. DOCK                                                     75 \nTwo Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why is one of the Rovers missing? \nIf Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers. \n76   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                       76 \nSam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is following a MAP on a small monitor. \n77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77 \nSam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER. \nSam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly. \nONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil. \nTHE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER \nThe crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped inside. \nSam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching for loose change on the floor of the vehicle. \nWith great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out -- Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI. \nSam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover, his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and turns the unconscious man onto his back. \nHe BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans down even closer. \nCLOSE UP -- THE MAN \nThrough his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of the film. \nSam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself. \nWIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER \nSam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him to the parked Rover. \nCUT TO: \n78   INT. DOCK -- A FEW MINUTES LATER                             78 \nSam drives the Rover into the Dock, flies out and removes his space helmet, screaming: \nSAM 1 Gerty? \nGERTY Yes, Sam? \nSAM 1 Is there someone in the room with us? \nGERTY Yes. \nSAM 1 Who is he? \nBut Sam 1 knows exactly who it is. He's seen that face every morning of his life in the bathroom mirror. \nGERTY Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired. \nSam 2 wordlessly walks out of the room. \nSam 1's eyes shift to Gerty, the spooked expression yet to leave his face. \nCUT TO: \n82   INT.

He turns from the TV and shares a LONG LOOK with Sam 1. Finally: \nSAM 1 Hi. \nSam 2 just nods. He turns back to the TV. \nSam 1 continues on down the corridor. \n84   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      84 \nGerty is studying lunar rock samples through a microscope. Sam 1 enters. \nSAM 1 Gerty, what the hell is going on? Who is that guy in the Rec Room? Where did he come from? Why does he look like me? \nSam 1 is perplexed, but not freaking out, not yet anyway. \nGERTY Sam, you're out of bed. \nSAM 1 Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed.   Who is the guy in the rec room? \nGERTY Sam Bell. \nSam 1 is officially FREAKING OUT now. \nSAM 1 Who the fuck is in the rec room, Gerty!? \nGERTY You are Sam Bell. \nA long pause. Sam 1 at the point of tears. \nGERTY (CONT'D) Sam, what is it? It might help to talk about it. \nSAM 1 I don't understand what's happening, Gerty. I think I may be losing my mind. \nGERTY We could run some tests. (a beat) I haven't reported anything to central, Sam. They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident. \nSAM 1 Recovered alive? What do you mean? Why haven't you reported to central? \nGERTY I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you. Are you hungry? \nSam 1 merely nods at this, turning and plodding out of the room, seemingly in a DAZE. \n85   INT. CORRIDOR                                                85 \nSam 1 comes out of the Monitoring Station, passes the Rec Room without looking in. \nSAM 1 (with a smile) Right. \nSAM 2 I didn't know it could get so thick. Does it itch? \nSAM 1 No, not really. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Listen, I wanted to say thank- you. If it wasn't for you I'd still be out there in the crashed rover. You saved my life. (then) Will you shake my hand? \nSam 2 hesitates, eventually shakes Sam 1's hand. Meanwhile Sam 1 is staring at his clone, astonished. \nSAM 2 (self-conscious) What? \nSAM 1 You look just like me. It's incredible. \nSAM 2 Why do I look like you? Why don't you look like me? \nSAM 1 We look like each other, I guess. \nThis final line intended as a kind of truce. \nCUT TO: \n89   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       89 \nSam 1 and Sam 2 are folding the Ping-Pong table down so they can have a real game. \nPING-PONG \nThe two Sams playing Ping-Pong. It's slightly competitive, but mainly they are just happy to take their minds off their situation for half an hour. \nSAM 1 Your serve. \nSAM 2 Score? \nSAM 1 Two points to eighteen. \nSAM 2 Fuck! \nSam 2 slaps his paddle on his thigh, his temper creeping up on him. He catches Sam's eye. Gets a grip. Sam 1 is a better player than Sam 2. He's been up here longer. He's had more practice. \n90   INT. REC ROOM -- LATER                                       90 \nAfter the game, the two Sams are sprawled in their seats, sweaty, flushed, energized. They sit before the model of the town. \nSAM 2 How long did it take you to do this? \nSAM 1 I don't remember doing all of it. I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army. And a few of the people. My mind's been acting kind of weird lately, though. \nSAM 2 It's Fairfield, right? (pointing) There's Town Hall. \nSAM 1 Uh-huh. You know Fairfield? (also pointing) That's the Baskin&Robbins. And there's Tess and Eve. Do you know Tess? \nThe mention of their wife has stopped the conversation in its tracks. Sam 2 immediately drops into deep melancholy. \nSAM 2 Yes.   I know Tess. \nSAM 1 You know about Eve, right? \nIt is obvious from Sam 2's expression that he doesn't. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) We had a girl. \nSAM 2 We did? (beat) She thought she was going to have a boy. She was so sure. (then) Eve? \nSam 1 nods. \nSAM 1 She's beautiful. She's really beautiful. \nSAM 2 How much did she weigh? Isn't that what you're supposed to ask, how much did she weigh? \nSAM 1 Nine pounds, eleven ounces. \nSam 2 doesn't know what to do with the news: on the one hand he is jubilant, on the other he's a clone, the baby technically isn't even his. \nAt once Sam 1 and Sam 2 ROCKET to their feet -- right in each others faces, on the BRINK of BLOWS. \nSAM 1 I'm going home! \nSAM 2 You're not going anywhere! \nSam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. Sam 2 STORMS after him, TALKING the whole time -- \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) You've been up here too long, man! You've lost the plot! \nGerty shuttles along after them. \n92    INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS                                92 \nSam 1 presses down the corridor, Sam 2 tailing right behind him. \nSAM 2 What, you think Tess is back home waiting for you? What about the original Sam? \nSAM 1 I'm the original! I'm Sam fucking Bell! Me! Me! \nSam 1, stress ball pumping away in his hand, spots Gety and angrily faces him. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Gerty, am I a clone? \nGerty doesn't know which way to look. \nGERTY Yes, Sam. \nSam 1 ducks in the Rec Room, Sam 2 in tow. \n93   INT. REC ROOM                                              93 \nSam 1 takes his old seat before the model. Sam 2 stands over him. \nSAM 2 What about the other clones? \n\"Other clones?\" Sam 1 just stares back. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) Yeah, we might not be the first two to be woken up. (indicating the model) You said that thing had already been started when you got here. Well, who started it? (then) There might be other clones up here right now. Think about it. How did I get here so quickly after your crash? They didn't ship me in from Central, there wasn't time. I must have come from the base. \nSAM 1 That's ridiculous. Impossible. Why would hey do that? \nSAM 2 I bet there's some kind of secret room -- \nSAM 1 (laughing) Secret room? \nSAM 2 Yeah, secret room, why not? \nSAM 1 (losing his cool) You're the one who's lost the plot! I've been here for three years. I know every inch of this base. I know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there -- why would they do that?! \nSAM 2 Look. It's a company, right? They have investors, shareholders -- shit like that. What's cheaper? Spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job. If they make it through their contract, great. If they don't, hallelujah! No contract completion fees, no retirement package. Just thaw out the spare, and keep the profits rolling in. It's the far side of the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's haven't even fixed our communications satellite. \nSAM 1 Tess would know. \nSAM 2 Do you really think they give a shit about us? They're laughing all the way to the bank! \nSAM 1 Tess would know what's going on! She wouldn't let that happen! \nSAM 2 (exhasperated) There's some area we don't know about. I'm going to find it. \nSam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden house, starts whittling. \nMeanwhile Sam 2 has left the room. \n94   INT. MONITORING STATION -- QUICK CUTS                      94 \nSam 2 in the Monitoring Station checking wall panels, reaching his hand inside cubbies and feeling around deep inside, SEARCHING. \n95   INT. CORRIDOR -- QUICK CUTS                                  95 \nSam 2 moving along the corridor, pressing his ear against panels, tapping with his finger -- \n96   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- QUICK CUTS                         96 \nThe Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers the toilet paper from his nose. \nSAM 1 Who are you? \nNo answer. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) (shouting) Who are you! \nSam 1 swings around to confront the Girl...but she's not there, she's vanished. Her reflection has vanished from the mirror also. \nCUT TO: \n99    INT. REC ROOM                                                99 \nSam 2 snaps on the TV with the remote, starts watching Laugh-In, turns, sees Sam 1 wander by in the corridor. Sam 2 considers calling out to him, opts against it, gives the TV his full attention. \n100   INT. MONITORING STATION                                    100 \nGerty is stationed at the Old Man collecting data. Sam 1 enters. \nGERTY Hello Sam. \nSAM 1 Hi Gerty. \nSam 1 sits. A pause. Gerty turns from the monitor, faces of with an EXHAUSTED and DRAINED Sam 1. \nGERTY Sam, is everything okay? \nSAM 1 We had a fight. Me and the other guy, the other Sam. We had a fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You know what he did? He flipped the entire model over. Do you know how much work I've put into that thing? \nGERTY 938 hours. \nSAM 1 938 hours, exactly. (then) Really? 938 hours. \nGERTY Approximately. \nSAM 1 (a beat) He scares me, Gerty. \nGERTY What is it about Sam that scares you? \nSAM 1 He flies off the handle. I see it now...I see what Tess was talking about. (a beat) I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me. Tess left me. For six months. She moved back in with her parents. \nGERTY I know. \nSAM 1 Oh... (beat) It was the year before I came in here. She gave me a second chance. I promised her I'd change. \nGERTY You have changed, Sam. \nSAM 1 Yeah, I guess I have. \nA beat. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Gerty, since I've been up here I've sent Tess over a hundred video messages. Where did those messages go? Did they ever reach her? \nA pause. \nGERTY Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base. \nSAM 1 What about the messages she sent to me? \nA long pause. Finally Gerty repeats: \nGERTY Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base. \nSAM 1 Gerty, am I really a clone? \nGERTY Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests. \nSAM 1 I remember. \nGERTY Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. (a beat) It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact-- \nSAM 1 And Tess?    Eve? \nSAM 1 How do you know the conversation was live? \nSAM 2 It was a back and forth exchange. And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers up on the monitor. I was supposed to be asleep in the Infirmary. The moment I walked into the comms room Gerty terminated the transmission. Now I was a little drugged up, granted, but I didn't imagine it. \nSAM 1 The communications equipment is damaged -- there was a solar storm -- \nSAM 2 Tabitha. \nSAM 1 Tabitha, right. \nSAM 2 Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't know. Bottom line is they don't want us to be able to contact Earth. Otherwise why would they have lied to us? \nA pause. Sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. Sam 2 concentrating on Sam 1. \nSAM 1 How are they blocking the live feed? The base's communications equipment works fine -- \nSAM 2 Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base. \nSAM 1 From where then? \nAs if reading each others minds, the two Sams' heads turn to the window -- a slow, perfectly synchronized movement. \nThe lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. The view almost cruel in its emptiness. It's not giving them any answers, not yet. \nCUT TO: \n103   I/E. ROVER ONE/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                            103 \nSam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers. He wears his space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed. \nHe flies past one of the Harvesters, speaks through a microphone inside his helmet. \nSAM 1 Just passing the last of the Harvesters -- looks like John -- \nAll of this against the ROAR of the Rover's engine. \n104   I/E. ROVER TWO/MOON SURFACE                                   104 \nDriving away from base in a   different direction, Sam 2. He also wears a space suit. He   also guns the engine. He also has a microphone inside his   helmet. The two clones are able to talk back and forth with   no delay. \nSAM 2 How long until you're out of the base's range? \nWe INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers. \nSAM 1 If I maintain this speed...a minute. Ninety seconds tops. \nSAM 2 You ever been this far out? \nSAM 1 No, never. \nANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER \nViewed from far away, the Rover's speed less impressive from a distance. \n105   I/E. ROVER'S ONE AND TWO/MOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT           105 \nAs the Sams continue to drive. \nSAM 1 You see anything yet? \nSAM 2 Nothing. You? \nSAM 1 There isn't shit out here...I feel like I'm about to drive off the end of the world. (then) It would help if I knew what I was looking for. \nThrough the glass of Sam 1's helmet we see his FACE suddenly SHIFT. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Wait a second, wait a second. \nSam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like he's trying to decipher a road sign -- \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) I see something. \nSAM 1'S POV \nThe Rover's door JERKS opens and Sam 1 steps out unsteadily, his face visibly PALE through the glass of his helmet. \nHe STAGGERS across the dock -- doesn't even close the Rover's door behind him -- heads into the corridor. \n108   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 108 \nSam 1 goes swerving up the corridor like a drunkard -- BANGING into walls -- he finally reaches the bathroom and ducks in -- \n109   INT. BATHROOM                                                 109 \nSam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. With great effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the floor next to him. He stares into the toilet. \nFor a moment all is calm. The gentle \"ping-ping-ping\" of a computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily. Spots of sweat on his upper lip. \nAnd then he VOMITS. He vomits LOUD, he vomits VIOLENTLY. His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process, taught, tense, like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN. \nSam 1 vomits again. And again. And again. And stops. \nANGLE FROM ABOVE -- SAM 1 \nSam 1's vomit is DARK RED -- he's thrown up BLOOD -- but that's not all -- we can clearly see two or three TEETH floating in the vomit -- \nTHE MIRROR \nSam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of teeth. \nHe flushes the toilet. \nCUT TO: \n110   EXT. MOON -- DAY                                              110 \nSam 2 driving along in his Rover. He comes across another one of these JAMMERS. He drives right up, ducks down, peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way. \nHow many of these things are there? \nSam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover, drives on. \nCUT TO: \n111   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       111 \nSam 1 enters and sits down at The Old Man. Frantically he starts typing in numbers. \nAn array of Log Entries appear ON THE SCREEN. Sam watches one of them. \nSAM 1 (on screen) January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32. All Harvesters running smoothly today. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9 miles... \nThese are just his log entries. What's he looking for? \nSam 1 starts scrolling BACK through the log entries, like he's REWINDING chapters on a DVD, showing himself at various stages of his time on Selene -- his beard essentially growing in REVERSE as the messages stretch further back -- eventually Sam 1 is clean shaven -- \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) (on the screen) Luke, 12.9 miles; John, 11.1 miles... \nSam 1 keeps typing in numbers. \nON THE SCREEN: \"RESTRICTED. PASSWORD REQUIRED.\" \nNo go.   He tries to hack his way in, but is having no luck. \nOne of Gerty's long spindly ARMS slides into the room. Sam backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it stops within reach of the computer. \nSam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the password in for him. It leaves the room the way it came in. \nSam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him? -- this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and looks seriously ILL -- \nHe is barely able to talk -- in fact he's SLURRING -- \nSAM (on screen) ...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm not feeling too hot today -- I'm going to have to continue this later -- \nThe SEQUENCE becomes a FAST-PACED and NIGHTMARISH MONTAGE -- continuing to BACKTRACK through the log entries -- showing yet more SAMS -- one has a MOUSTACHE -- one has a SHAVED HEAD -- one has grown out his hair and has a PONY TAIL, we've seen this particular Sam before in an earlier scene. \nBut all the Sams have one thing in common: towards the latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in very bad physical shape -- \nFor a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly -- but is still pulled in, intrigued. \nEVE BELL I'm fifteen. (then) Do I know you? \nSAM 1 How did mom die, sweetheart? \nEVE BELL Uh... \nNow Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from the screen and calls to someone in another room: \nEVE BELL (CONT'D) Dad! \nAnd then we hear a voice. Sam's voice. \nSAM'S VOICE (O.S.) What! \nEVE BELL Dad, there's someone asking about mom... \nSam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER. \nSAM'S VOICE Who's asking about mom? \nSam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP. \nHe sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth -- Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now. \n120   EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     120 \nThe Rover viewed from outside. We can't hear a thing. Just the endless and unrelenting MOON SILENCE. \nInside the Rover we are able to make out Sam 1, quivering at the wheel as he sobs. \nCUT TO: \n121   INT.

Now he is attempting to fix some of the demolished pieces. At this moment he's gluing the spire back on the church. \nSam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. Moments later Sam 1 appears in the doorway wearing the backpack. \nSam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL. His depleting health has been evident throughout the film, but now it seems to have jumped to a new level. \nHe watches Sam 2 for a little while. \nSAM 1 Want me to help? \nSam 2 shifts over to give Sam 1 the adjacent chair. Sam 1 walks over, sits down. Together they work on gluing the church back together. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Remember that crazy drunk guy who used to hang out by the church? \nSAM 2 Barbara Streisand? \nSAM 1 (with a smile) He looked like Barbara Streisand. We used to hide his Bible when he passed out. Drove the guy nuts. \nSam 2 nods, remembering. A pause. \nSAM 2 How do you carve these things? \nSAM 1 Want me to show you? \nSam 2 nods. Sam 1 picks up a block of wood, grabs an exacto blade. Demonstrates. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) You need to hold the wood away from you. Like this. \nEVE This is the Bell residence. \nSAM 2 (commenting as he watches) No you didn't... \nSAM 1 (O.S.) I'm trying to reach Tess Bell. \nEVE I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago. \nSam 2 and Sam 1 have exactly the same reaction at the same time. \nSAM 1 (O.S.)                           SAM 2 No...no way.                     No...no way. \nSAM 1 (O.S.) Tess Bell? Are you sure? \nEVE Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her daughter. (then) Can I help you? \nI'm her daughter. A couple of days ago Sam 2 didn't know he had a daughter, and now he's seeing her as a teenager, a young woman. He is stunned. \nSam 2 continues to watch the message but we \nCUT TO: \n125   INT.

Right now he's STACKING ready-meals and miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns. \nSam 2 walks up. \nSAM 2 Gerty, I need to talk to you. \nGERTY Of course, Sam, how can I help? \nSAM 2 We found the hidden room. We know about the other clones. \nA long pause. Then: \nGERTY I don't know of a hidden room. \nSAM 2 The hidden room under the Return Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm talking about. We found it on our own. Lunar doesn't know anything about it. \nA beat. \nGERTY The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones -- \nSAM 2 Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with there being two of us awake at the same time, and what with the situation being unprecedented, the rules have had to change. Do you understand? \nGERTY I understand the situation is unprecedented. \nSAM 2 Good. (a beat) Gerty, how long does it take for a clone to wake up? \nGERTY A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. But he is not fully conscious for several hours. \nA beat. \nSAM 2 Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone. \nGERTY I am not permitted to do that, Sam. \nSAM 2 If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die. We'll die, Gerty. Do you understand? \nGERTY Yes. \nSAM 2 Do you want me and the other Sam to die? \nGERTY That is the last thing I want. \nSAM 2 Then you have to wake up a new clone. Okay, pal? \nSam 2 waits for a response. And waits. \nSAM 1 I don't know. (beat) It's what we were designed to do. \nBoth Sams struggle to hold in their emotions; Sam 1 morose, Sam 2 angry. \nSAM 2 Screw that! I'll go! ...And I'm going to find this asshole, Sam Bell, and ask him why the hell he put us through this shit! \nSam 1 looks concerned.   Sam 2 reads his mind. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) I'll be careful. I'll keep Eve out of it. She wont even know I exist. \nSam 1 smiles wearily, watching his old self. \nSAM 1 You're a good guy, Sam. \nSAM 2 I might stop shaving; It suits us. (beat) If all our memories are implants, no disrespect, but I think its about time I got some of my own, as well. \nSAM 1 Yeah. You should travel.     I've always wanted to do that. \nSAM 2 I'd like that. \nCUT TO: \n143   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                              143 \nDriving to the crash site. Sam 2 at the wheel, Sam 1 riding shotgun. Both men staring ahead in silence. \nMATTHEW \nWhere all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it. The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater shipwreck. \nThe Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester. \n144   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    144 \nSam 2 keeps the engine running as Sam 1 takes a handful of TRANQUILIZERS one by one, washing down each pill with a swig from a bottle of water. \nAfterwards: a long pause. The two Sams sitting side by side, staring across the bleak landscape. Neither of them wants to say good-bye particularly. \nSAM 1 Tess came in for the interview, remember? \nSam 2 is nodding away. Of course he remembers. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) She was so beautiful. Even   if she wasn't the best candidate,   I just knew I had to give her the   job. I thought she was so sweet. (a beat) And then it was the end of   the summer. \nSAM 2 She was going back to San Francisco. (MORE) \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) You knew you had to take a chance. So you called her. You were terrified and wrote that whole speech for her answer machine -- (a beat) But I didn't need it because Tess answered the phone. And I could tell in her voice as we talked, she was thinking... \"Why has Sam called me?\" \"The internship's over, why's he called me at home?\" And then I asked her if she was going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue and... \nSam 1 has dropped off to sleep. The back and forth exchange is now essentially Sam 2's monologue. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) That's when I knew she liked me. Because she didn't want to talk to anyone else! She'd get up, get some potato salad, go to the bathroom, but she'd always come back. And then we kissed. On the steps in front of her apartment building. \nSam 2 finally turns and looks at Sam 1. Sam 1's head cocked to one side, eyes closed. \nSam 2 lifts the helmet off Sam 1's lap -- carefully lowers the helmet onto Sam 1's head. \n145   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     145 \nSam 2 LOPES towards the crashed rover holding Sam 1 in both arms like a bride. He places Sam 1 on the ground and PRIZES open the rover door -- he slowly slides Sam 1 inside. \nInside the Rover Sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly against the passenger side door. At once he looks peaceful and wretchedly uncomfortable. \nSam 2 can barely bring himself to look at Sam 1. With both hands he FORCES the door CLOSED, pivots around and slowly BOBS back to his rover. \n146   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    146 \nSam 2 driving back to base. He has removed his helmet and is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove. \nCUT TO: \n147   INT.

Sam sees a sliver of the sun as he dawns on his side of the moon. He closes his eyes for the last time. \nCUT TO: \n153   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                    153 \nSam 2 stands before Gerty. \nSAM 2 I've set your computer to reboot the second I've blasted off. \nGERTY Okay, Sam. \nSAM 2 Thanks for all your help, Gerty. I wish I could say I was going to miss you, buddy, but to be honest, I can't wait to get away from here. \nGERTY I understand, Sam. I hope life is everything you remember it to be. \nSAM 2 Thanks. Are you sure you're going to be ok? \nGERTY Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting. \nSAM 2 Gerty, I'm not programmed. \nGerty doesn't respond.    Sam 2 seems troubled. \nSam 2 leans forward and activates the Memory Erase button. Gerty's READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK. \nThe Robot has been officially SHUT DOWN. \nGerty just stands there. Completely still. As lifeless as a toy. \nSam 2 heads out of the room at top speed. \n154   EXT.

The Rescue Unit is so close Sam 2 might actually be able to pick out their spacecraft. \nAnd he can! It's tiny, but nevertheless it's there -- a metallic spacecraft, glinting like a jewel -- and heading steadily towards the Moon. \nThere isn't a moment to lose. Sam 2 swings around, heads for the CARGO CONTAINER. \nWe remain inside the Monitoring Station as Sam 2 climbs inside the Cargo Container He readies himself. Says a little prayer and... he cant do it! Cursing at himself and glancing at the time ticking away before Eliza lands, he jumps back out of the CARGO CONTAINER and runs back into the base. \nCUT TO: \n156   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      156 \nSam 2 sits down before the Old Man. Eliza's imminent arrival causing increased STRESS and TENSION. \nSam 2 takes out the piece of paper on which the COORDINATES of the Jammers are printed out. \nHe starts to frantically type, altering the PATH of the HARVESTERS. \n157   EXT.

MONITORING STATION                                      158 \nBack on Sam 2 as he RAPIDLY types, makes an error, screams: \nSAM 2 Fuck! \nPounds the delete button, continuing to type coordinates into the Old Man -- He's done! He leaps out of his chair and tears off through the base towards the cargo container. \nCUT TO: \n159   EXT.

CORRIDOR -- DAY                                         61 \nSam walking down the corridor in the direction of the Sleeping Quarters. He stops at a RED LIGHT on the corridor wall, beneath it the word, \"EXIT DOORS.\" \nHe's locked inside the base. \nSam pulls a face, disgruntled, continues down the corridor. \n62   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS                       62 \nSam takes in the New York Jets poster on the wall and walks over to the bed -- studies his lucky tambourine and the glass jar of lunar rock samples -- like he's trying to reacquaint himself with his own belongings. \nHis eyes arrive on the red stress ball. Sam scoops up the ball and PITCHES it at the wall like he expects the thing to bounce back to him. The stress ball doesn't bounce back, simply hits the wall with a dull THUD and DROPS to the FLOOR. \nCUT TO: \n63   EXT. THE MOON -- DAY                                       63 \nA desolation special. The blacker than black sky above. None of the ingredients of life. On Earth we have rainforests, and flowers, and birds. We have color. Up here we realize how lucky we are. The base is lit by large halogen comfort lights, alone in the lunar desert. This is a lunar night. \nCUT TO: \n64   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MORNING                         64 \nSam sitting before The Old Man doing a few innocuous tasks, collecting readouts, slurping a cup of coffee. Gerty is within ear shot. \nSam sees something that pulls him CLOSER to the monitor. \nSAM Gerty, do you know about this? \nGerty approaches. Sam taps the screen. \nSAM (CONT'D) Matthew's got no velocity read- out. He's completely still. \nGERTY (O.S.) He must have stalled. \nSam gives Gerty a look. That's not good. \n65   INT. COMMS ROOM -- LATER                                     65 \nSam is recording a message for Central. \nSAM There's no way to tell from here if a track's been thrown, or if it's just something jammed in an axle, or what... I can shoot out there, check it out, get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew! I know how tight money is right now.... \nSam really frustrated now. He feels cooped up, stir crazy, idle. \nSAM (CONT'D) Just give me the word -- or Gerty the word, tell him to unlock the exit doors -- and I'll go out and get Matthew up and running again. (a beat) That's it. Over and out. \nSam sends the message. \nCUT TO: \n66   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                     66 \nSam enters the Rec Room, looks around, his eyes settling on the model of the town. \nSam sits down in front of the model, staring -- he picks up the HOUSE he was carving earlier -- studies it carefully. \nCUT TO: \n67   INT. COMMS ROOM -- DAY                                       67 \nSam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE, examining it as he listens to the video. \nThe familiar faces of Overmeyers and Thompson on the screen, shoulder to shoulder, the two looking more like vultures right now than lizards. \nTHOMPSON Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better. \n", "test1_true": "OVERMEYERS We don't want you to take any unnecessary risks. You're too important to us. \nTHOMPSON You're to stay put, understand? \nOVERMEYERS It's an order. \nTHOMPSON It's an order, Sam. From Lunar. Stay put. \nOVERMEYERS We're going to send a Rescue Unit to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet. \nSAM (incensed) Why? \nThe message ends. Sam turns to Gerty, irate, the message as good as a kick in the balls. \nGERTY I'm sorry Sam. \nSam stares at Gerty. \nGERTY (CONT'D) Sam, I am under strict orders not to let you outside. \nSam throws the half completed wood carving in his hand at the other end of the room, breaking it. He FLIES to his feet -- growling with frustration -- STORMS out of the room. \nCUT TO: \n68   INT.

We remain very close to their bodies in bed. The background a blur. It's the same dream we saw earlier. \nSomething is different though. \nWe drift past Sam and Tess, and under the sheets of the bed. \nDown between their entwined feet huddles a bearded, wide- eyed Sam, staring directly at us from under the sheets at the end of the bed! \nCUT TO: \n70   INT. REC ROOM                                                70 \nSam is quietly eating breakfast, lost in thought. Gerty puttering around in the background. The radio drones away. \n71   INT.

I'm certain he's a boy. I wish you could feel it. (a beat, shifting) I think we made the right choice, Sam. I really do. We need some time apart. We got stuck. That happens in marriages sometimes. It's nothing terrible. (then) Well listen, I love you lots -- and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye Sam. \nA POP and Tess is gone -- the monitor filled with STATIC. Sam sits staring into space. Tess' message seems to have agitated him. \nSAM Fuck it. \nHe JUMPS from his chair and HEADS OUT of the Comms Room at pace. \n72   INT.

An ALARM sounds. \n", "test2_input": "SAM 2 Is there a light? \nBoth Sams FUMBLE along opposing walls -- Sam 1 eventually finding a SWITCH, snaps it on. \nAn array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to STUTTER and FLASH before ILLUMINATING the chamber completely -- \nThe two Sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of PODS -- like upright glass coffins -- and standing inside each pod, an as-of-yet UNAWAKENED CLONE. It's like an ENTIRE ARMY of Sam Bells... \nSpooky as hell. \nFor a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak. They walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking at each clone one at a time -- all the clones are bare chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their genitals, like a diaper. \nOf course they all look the same, that's why they're clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind- boggling to Sam 1 and 2 -- they MARVEL at how each of the clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest of details -- same length of hair, same skin tone, same fingernails -- \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) Why are there so many of them? \nSAM 1 The cryo pod in the Return Vehicle is an incinerator. \nSam 2 reacts with appropriate shock. \nSAM 2 What? \nSAM 1 We don't go home. We're burned to death up there. Then the company wakes up a new one. Every three years. Like clock work. \nSam 2 absorbing this. Then: \nSAM 2 How do you know all this? \nSAM 1 (beat) I hacked into the Old Man. Actually, Gerty did. I saw footage. You're right, there have been other clones before us. \nSAM 2 How many? \nSAM 1 Enough. \nA pause. \nSAM 2 If that Rescue Unit finds the two of us awake at the same time, they'll kill us both for sure. \nSam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) What are we going to do? \nAll of a sudden Sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder, starts heading back up. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) Where are you going? \n117   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER                      117 \nSam 1 is digging in drawers, removes some equipment, some wires; a radio, a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE, referred to as a VP. \nHe is watched by Gerty. \nGERTY Sam, can I help you with something? \nSAM 1 Not now, Gerty, okay? \nGerty begins to slide out of the room.   Sam calls after him. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Gerty? Why did you help me? With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or something? \nGERTY Helping you is what I do. \nGerty leaves. \nSam 1 goes on picking up equipment, shoves it all into a backpack he swiped from a peg. \nNow Sam 2 appears in the doorway. \nSAM 2 What's going on? \nSAM 1 There's something I've got to do. \nSam 1 brushes by Sam 2 on his way out. \n", "test2_true": "Sam 1 marches up to his Rover, tosses in the backpack and dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs out into the black day. \n119   I/E.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might be able to get a signal through to Earth. \nON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but nonetheless high-quality screen. \nSam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end, so he is only sending audio. \nA moment of silence. The VP seems dead. \nSAM 1 Come on...come on... \nThen the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems to have gone through. \nAnd suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen. \nSam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress. \nThe moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally -- that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks: \nGIRL Hello? \nThat's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to respond: \nSAM 1 Uh, Bell residence? \nThe conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on the Girl's end. \nThe Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting, ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations. \nGIRL This is the Bell Residence. \nSAM 1 I'm trying to reach Tess Bell. \nThe girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between melancholy and curiosity -- \nGIRL I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago. \nSam 1 GASPS.

I'm her daughter. (then) Can I help you? \nAnd astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new revelation. \nThe girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER. \nSam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face. \nSAM 1 Eve? \nSam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful. \nEVE BELL Yes? \nA moment.

Eliza arrives, finds you and me as the welcome party -- \nSAM 2 They're not going to find you and me as the welcome party, they're going to find me. You're going to blast back to Earth before they get here in one of the Helium 3 containers. (a beat) You're going home. \nSam 1 wasn't expecting that. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) You've done your three years. I can't expect you to stick around. Maybe you can meet Eve in person. \nA beat. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) I saw the message on the VP. Eve is beautiful. She looks like her mom. \nSam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no secrets between them now. \nThey both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead. Finally: \nSAM 1 How do you think she died? \nSAM 2 I don't know. (then) Jane died of cancer. I mean, it was in the family. Who knows? Or maybe it was an accident? Could have been a million things. \nSAM 1 I wish I'd been there. \nSAM 2 Yeah. Me too. \nThe two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief. \nCUT TO: \n136   EXT.

Looking forward to Eliza straightening everything out and things getting back to normal around here. Well...that's it. I'll let you know how it goes.

She's your daughter, man! She's not going to care what you... \nSAM 1 (angry) She's not! She's not... my daughter. At least, I'm not her father. Not to her. \nSam 2 keeps quiet. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) I'll put myself in the Rover, I'll be the body -- it was me to begin with anyway, right? You go back to Earth. You go back. You're healthy. You've got three years ahead of you. You stand a much better chance than I do. The other guy....Gerty can get him up to speed...he can be here to meet Eliza when they arrive. \nSam 1 seems to have it all figured out. Although Sam 2 should in some ways be relieved by Sam 1's decision, he looks closer to distraught. \nSAM 2 This is wrong. What are we supposed to do? Sit around here and wait to die? Fuck that! \n"}

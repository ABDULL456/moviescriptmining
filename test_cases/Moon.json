Who is that guy in the Rec Room? Where did he come from? Why does he look like me? \nSam 1 is perplexed, but not freaking out, not yet anyway. \nGERTY Sam, you're out of bed. \nSAM 1 Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed.   Who is the guy in the rec room? \nGERTY Sam Bell. \nSam 1 is officially FREAKING OUT now. \nSAM 1 Who the fuck is in the rec room, Gerty!? \nGERTY You are Sam Bell. \nA long pause. Sam 1 at the point of tears. \nGERTY (CONT'D) Sam, what is it? It might help to talk about it. \nSAM 1 I don't understand what's happening, Gerty. I think I may be losing my mind. \nGERTY We could run some tests. (a beat) I haven't reported anything to central, Sam. They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident. \nSAM 1 Recovered alive? What do you mean? Why haven't you reported to central? \nGERTY I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you.

Im a fucking clone. \nSAM 1 How long have you been here? \nSAM 2 About a week. \nA beat. \nSAM 1 How are you getting on? \nSAM 2 (repeating the question slowly) How am I getting on? (then) The company ordered Gerty to lock all the exits. I haven't been able to do anything for seven days but sit on my ass. \nSAM 1 They locked all the exits? What about the harvesters? \nSAM 2 Slowed them down to half speed, apparently. (MORE) \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) And then when I finally trick Gerty into letting me outside I find a clone of myself in a crashed rover. How am I getting on?

He's a maniac. You know what he did? He flipped the entire model over. Do you know how much work I've put into that thing? \nGERTY 938 hours. \nSAM 1 938 hours, exactly.

She moved back in with her parents. \nGERTY I know. \nSAM 1 Oh... (beat) It was the year before I came in here. She gave me a second chance.

Finally Gerty repeats: \nGERTY Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base. \nSAM 1 Gerty, am I really a clone? \nGERTY Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests. \nSAM 1 I remember. \nGERTY Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. (a beat) It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health.

I'm sorry. \nSAM 1 It's okay. \nSAM 2 No it's not okay. I fucked up Fairfield -- your model -- that's unacceptable. I don't know what's wrong with me. (then) I've got a temper. I need to do something about it. \nSAM 1 Yes you do. \nA pause. \nSAM 2 I've been thinking. That Rescue Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here in less than fourteen hours. I don't know about you but I'd like to figure out where we stand before they get here. \nSAM 1 Absolutely. \nSAM 2 Ostensibly they're coming to deal with the stalled harvester. We both know that isn't true. (then) They're coming to dig your body out of that rover.

Moments later Sam 1 appears in the doorway wearing the backpack. \nSam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL.

Together they work on gluing the church back together. \nSAM 1 (CONT'D) Remember that crazy drunk guy who used to hang out by the church? \nSAM 2 Barbara Streisand? \nSAM 1 (with a smile) He looked like Barbara Streisand. We used to hide his Bible when he passed out. Drove the guy nuts. \nSam 2 nods, remembering. A pause. \nSAM 2 How do you carve these things? \nSAM 1 Want me to show you? \nSam 2 nods.

It actually seems to propel Sam 1 out of his chair and up onto his feet. Sam 2 watches with concern. Eventually the coughing subsides. \nSAM 2 What's happening to you? \nSam 1 averts his gaze. \nSAM 2 (CONT'D) Listen, I realize I've been less than cooperative. But I want to change that.

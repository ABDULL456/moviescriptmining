CARLA No. 
She tries to pull free; he won't let her go. 
LINA (O.S.) Carla! 
CARLA Just after midnight. Five past... But don't come through the house, they'll hear you. I'm in the back bedroom, second floor. Climb onto the kitchen roof, I'll leave the window open. 
He tries to kiss her, but she ducks away and goes out. 
EXT. STREET/INT. O.L.'S VAN -- EVENING 
Danny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled brick. For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out. Finally he opens the door.... 
INT. AHAVAT TORAH, FOYER -- EVENING 
A LARGE WOMAN, about 40, her body barely contained by a brilliant magenta dress, greets him with a smile the size of a wedding cake. She holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers. 
LARGE WOMAN Shabbat shalom. 
She speaks quietly, not wanting to disturb the service, yet even so her voice is huge, and her flashing eyes clearly expect some kind of enthusiastic response. Within we hear the ALENU being chanted. 
Danny ignores her and the proffered siddur. A basket of yarmulkes seems to infuriate him, but he snatches one anyway and, conveying a helpless disgust, puts it on his head. From within he hears... 
CONGREGATION (O.S.) (in rough unison) Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo...(etc.) 
He stands with his hand on the door, but not opening it. 
RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.) On that day, the Eternal shall be One. And His Name shall be One.... 
The organist plays a brief decrescendo.... 
RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE The mourner's kaddish can be found on page 187.... 
LARGE WOMAN Is anything wrong? 
DANNY Shut the fuck up. 
She's startled but not intimidated, is about to respond, when Danny simply turns and walks out of the building. 
EXT. AHAVAT TORAH -- EVENING 
He stops beneath an open window through which he hears... 
RABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE ...Grant us peace, thy most precious gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace. We recall with loving memory those whom Thou hast summoned unto thee. And we mention by name...Sophie Budnitz...Bernard Schwabb...Milton Lifter...Aaron Lustig...Minnie Baum... 
Danny closes his eyes, but at the end adds, under her breath: 
DANNY ...Harriet Kantor Balint... 
A half dozen VOICES, including Danny's, recite in unison... 
DANNY & OTHERS Yis-ga-dal v'yis-ka-dash sh'may ra-bo... 
The body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases, producing a subtle and solemn music. Danny chants the entire prayer, and the moment it ends, and the rabbi begins the benediction.... 
RABBI'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED) May the Lord bless you and keep you.... 
EXT. AHAVAT TORAH/STREET -- EVENING 
...he starts toward his car. But the Rabbi's VOICE seems to follow him, unnaturally loud and clear: 
RABBI (O.S.) May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.... 
DANNY (to himself) Eat shit.... 
RABBI (O.S.) ...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming.... 
DANNY (shouting to the empty street) EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES.... 
RABBI (O.S.) And let us say... 
RABBI & CONGREGATION (with organ; singsong) Ah -- ah -- ah....men.... 
As Danny reaches the van, he sees the LARGE WOMAN silhouetted in the open doorway.... 
LARGE WOMAN YOU EAT SHIT.

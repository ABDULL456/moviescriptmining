A pause, then Lawrence collapses onto the floor. Hes lost the last of any strength, level headedness or control he had before. 
LAWRENCE (weakly) How did I get here? (Adam sits down on the pipe in his corner, leaning forward a bit.) I had...I had everything in order. (he lays down on his side, facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy) My whole life was in perfect order. (He holds up and looks at the picture of Alison and Diana gagged.) 
Cut to the Gordons Bedroom. Zep puts Alisons gag back on her, then leaves the room. Alison moves her head around to loosen the gag then spits it out. She tries to fight her sobs as she speaks softly to Diana. 
ALISON Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes her head no) Mommy just needs you to be really, really, really strong right now. Im not gonna let anybody hurt you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, thats my good girl. (She starts crying as her hands work behind her to loosen the rope around them.) 
Cut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance camera, sitting on the floor. Adams next line is a voice over over this shot. 
ADAM Hey, was there someone else at your house last night besides your wife and daughter? 
LAWRENCE (on camera) No. 
ADAM (still on camera) Well, theres someone here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, whosits up, picks it up and looks at it. After a moment, the shot cuts back to a regular view of them, in the room.) 
LAWRENCE (realization) I know him. (We see the photo as well. It is a shot looking up into Lawrences window, with Zep standing there, looking out, completely unaware of his picture being taken.) Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. The shot goes back and forth between him as his eyes widen while Lawrence makes his threats.) His name is Zep. Hes an orderly at my hospital. (his voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. You perverted little psychopath. Im gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck! 
Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with a very worried look. He points up to it. 
ADAM Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads at 6:00.) Were out of time. 
DIANA (crying) Mommy help me! 
Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly replaces Dianas gag and then her own, and resumes her position with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes his head sadly. He speaks calmly. 
ZEP Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed. (He undoes her gag, holds the phone to her head and his gun in front of her chest.) 
Quick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it. 
LAWRENCE (speaking quickly, the growling voice) Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam gets up from his corner, moves forward slightly) I know its you, you son of a bitch! 
ALISON Larry? 
LAWRENCE (his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced with worry) Ally? 
Cut into the bedroom.

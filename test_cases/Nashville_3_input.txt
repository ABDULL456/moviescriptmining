TOM You look terrific. 
Another pause. BILL sticks his head out from the studio room. 
BILL Hey! 
TOM It's the den mother. 
MARY walks pant TOM into the studio room. TOM holds up a finger to indicate he'll be a minute and walks toward the bathroom. MARY reaches BILL. 
BILL Come on, dammit. They want to check levels. 
L.A. JOAN goes and waits outside the bathroom. When TOM comes out they exit together. 
144	INT. STUDIO A 
MARY is at her mike with her instrument. The engineer asks for a level so BILL and MARY sing their hit song. When they finish, 
BILL Where is he!

BARBARA JEAN is sitting at the foot of the bed. A NURSE in there talking to BARNETT. 
NURSE The doctor is out of town. 
BARNETT I know that and don't you worry, I'm going to get her right into bed. 
NURSE She must rest. 
BARNETT I have this release form signed by the floor doctor. 
The PHONE RINGS.

NURSE Well, I don't know. 
BARNETT I have a nurse waiting for her in the bus. 
BARBARA JEAN Who brought these? 
NURSE I don't remember seeing those. 
BARNETT Somebody brought them. Come on, honey, let's go. 
She puts them on the gurney with the others. 
BARBARA JEAN Well, thank you all so much. You tell the other ladies thank you. 
NURSE Well all right. 
As they start out, DELBERT enters.

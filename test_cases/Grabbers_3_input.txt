FADE IN: 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
Across the inky swell, a river of moonlight cuts a path to a lonely fishing tug drifting with the tide. THE MERRY WIDOW. 
INT. MERRY WIDOW GALLEY - NIGHT 
A light bulb waltzes with the sway of the boat. Three shabby Irish fishermen unwind after dinner, playing cards. 
The eldest and scruffiest (the SKIPPER) reveals his hand to a young deckhand (GREG). Read 'em and weep. 
GREG You can't be serious? 
Laughing, the Skipper unspools himself from the cramped table as he and ROY, the bloated first-mate, clamber above deck. 
GREG Every bloody night. 
EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT 
Roy and the Skipper check the hauled in nets, until ... 
A SILENT ARC OF LIGHT SLICES ACROSS THE SKY.     It careens downwards in a furious trajectory and -- 
BOOM!!   A mile off their port it collides with the sea. 
ROY Did you see that? 
SKIPPER ... Yeah. 
ROY A flare? 
The Skipper watches the water.     Unsure. 
Greg leaps on deck brandishing a clutch of cards. 
GREG Ye cheated! There's five aces!    I counted 'em! 
The Skipper brushes past Greg, distracted. 
SKIPPER Secure the lines. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          2. 
Greg looks to Roy. 
GREG Not so funny now, huh? 
Roy plucks one of the five aces from Greg's hand and flips it over. Its backing is red. 
ROY It's from a different deck, ya muppet. 
He sticks it to Greg's damp forehead and carries on as ordered. Greg turns the remaining aces over. They're blue. 
GREG ... Shite. 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
Foam rises as bubbles crest violently. Closing in, the Merry Widow casts its searchlight across the churning surf. 
INT. PILOTHOUSE / EXT. OCEAN 
The Skipper steers carefully, holding a radio mic. 
SKIPPER (INTO MIC) Haven Point. Haven Point. Haven Point. This is Fishing tug Merry Widow. Call sign echo whiskey niner ait fife. Position five nautical miles west of Erin Island. Responding to unknown distress flare. Over. 
The Skipper pulls back on the throttle, sloshing to a stop. 
He taps the sonar screen.     A hazy shadow engulfs the readout. 
SKIPPER Definitely something ...

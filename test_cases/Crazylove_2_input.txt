LETTY Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions. 
MICHAEL Fuck.    That's all true. 
Letty laughs. 
MICHAEL Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes. 
LETTY What are the delusions like? 
MICHAEL I think people are after me, crap like that. (beat) (MORE) 
MICHAEL(cont'd) When I was 18, my mom came home and found me sitting naked on the kitchen table. I thought I was God. 
He waits for Letty to register the information. 
MICHAEL Shocking, huh? 
LETTY Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store. 
MICHAEL I wish I could have seen that. 
LETTY I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent. 
MICHAEL M y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light. (beat) But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones. 
Lying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the leaves overhead. 
MICHAEL (with a start) Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up. 
LETTY Break up?    They wish. 
Michael and Letty hug. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Nurse Gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles into little paper cups. A Federal Express delivery man with a bunch of boxes stops at the station. 
DELIVERY MAN I need a signature, please. 
Nurse Gates looks at the form. 
NURSE GATES What is all this stuff? 
DELIVERY MAN I just deliver it, Ma'am. 
NURSE GATES Well, who exactly is it for? 
DELIVERY MAN A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom. 
NURSE GATES I see. Can you wait a moment? 
Nurse Gates locks the medication in a cupboard, and hurries down the hallway. 
INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - SAME 
Our usual cast of characters. 
DR. EMLEE But how does that make you feel, John, what Letty said about your hostility? 
JOHN She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. 
Nurse Gates barrels in.   The group looks up. 
NURSE GATES I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a moment with Mrs. Hallstrom. 
DR. EMLEE What seems to be the problem? 
NURSE GATES They say she ordered...Mrs. Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of stuff, because Federal Express... M rs. Hallstrom's face glows. 
MRS. HALLSTROM It's here, everyone. Come along. It's here. 
She runs out. Nurse Gates follows her. A moment passes.    The patients look expectantly at Dr. Emlee. 
DR. EMLEE Oh, fine, let's see. 
They storm the door. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - SAME 
By the time the patients round the corner, the Federal Express man is leaving, and Mrs. Hallstrom has ripped open one of the boxes. She clutches a handful of jewelry. 
MRS. HALLSTROM For you, John. And, Letty. And, Michael, I know you'll love these. 
She hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings. He clips them on. Letty and several others carry necklaces. Thomas sports a rhinestone tiara. The patients compare jewelry. 
DR. EMLEE Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all this? 
JOHN (to Mrs. Hallstrom) Thomas got a crown and all I got was a lousy bracelet?

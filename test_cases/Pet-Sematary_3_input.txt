A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS recoils with a startled, muffled cry. 
EXT.  CHURCH 
The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow! 
EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH 
LOUIS Church! God, you scared the life out of me! 
CHURCH Waow! 
LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND comes again and he looks toward: 
EXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV 
Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH 
LOUIS (to the cat) I know one thing that will keep you home, good buddy. 
He starts toward the house. 
BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD SPEAK. 
INT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY 
Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!! 
THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape. 
We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL, climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a Gerrypak. 
EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD 
They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them catch up. 
JUD Take a look behind you. 
They turn around, and their faces express their wonder. 
LOUIS My God! 
RACHEL It's beautiful! 
EXT.  THE VIEW 
It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9 just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue. 
EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS 
JUD You folks ready to go on? 
LOUIS Sure. 
ELLIE But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? 
JUD You'll see soon enough, hon. 
They go into the woods, still following the path. 
EXT.  FOREST  DAY 
These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his mark here. 
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked. 
JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps are. 
LOUIS Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies? 
JUD Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. 
ELLIE (giggling) Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. 
JUD (smiles) Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc? 
LOUIS Not yet...how much further is it? 
JUD Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. 
He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him. LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then they press on. 
EXT.  THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY 
EXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH 
JUD (stopping) This is the place, honey. 
ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch but can't. She whips around to look at her mother. 
ELLIE What's it say, mommy? 
A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like this. Not a bit. 
RACHEL It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's misspelled, but...that's what it says. 
She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever. 
RACHEL Ellen--! 
EXT.  ELLIE 
She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning. 
EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD 
RACHEL (a bit lame) Be careful. 
EXT.  ELLIE 
She goes racing into the Pet Sematary. 
EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD 
JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail. 
JUD I told you it was a bad road, Louis--it's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something good come of it. This place. 
ELLIE (excited voice) Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it! 
EXT.  ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY

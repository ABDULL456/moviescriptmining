SHERMAN Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in command behind Jimmy. 
AT THE CROW'S NEST 
Chasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA. Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man. 
OUTSIDE THE ARBOR 
the agents stand. Cooch is writing into a small notebook. 
SHERMAN Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle's claws and a bear's balls. 
MILES She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in her truck. And she'll use it. 
As Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile manner. It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset. He holds the hand of a LITTLE GIRL, dressed in traditional dancing garb. 
He approaches Ray. 
RAY Mr. Clear Moon. 
CLEAR MOON Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here. 
Clear Moon gestures for the little girl to run off. He leans in close to Ray. 
CLEAR MOON They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people. 
RAY They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation. 
Clear Moon is looking past Ray at the Warriors. They are approaching the agents, and Clear Moon looks at Ray with great concern. 
CLEAR MOON Help us. 
And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor. 
Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos. 
AGENT SHERMAN Where's Jimmy? We thought he'd be dancing today. 
The warriors make a show of not acknowledging the FBI presence. They have walked over here just to walk by them. That is there statement. But Yellow Bird stops cranking the wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray. 
YELLOW BIRD Are you the Washington Redskin? 
Even the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit. All but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, considering the crippled activist. 
AGENT MILES Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird, Ray. 
Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke- cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves the feds alone. 
Ray turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander under the arbor, visiting people. LAKOTA SINGERS start up. 
COOCH Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on his Warriors. 
IN THE POWWOW CENTER 
the under ten year-old "fancy dance" -- TWENTY-FIVE INDIAN CHILDREN, whirling and stomping and dancing. 
JIMMY LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The battered old house sits under a full moon. The upside down flag moves slightly in the cross winds. 
ACROSS THE ROAD 
several junked cars. Among them a black, rusted out VW van with a smashed windshield. A PACK OF RES DOGS sniff at its tires. 
INT. JIMMY'S VAN 
In the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house. 
Across the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears a sound. 
POV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and salivating. 
RAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low, watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road, leading to Jimmy's. 
POV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian. Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside. 
RAY lifts his radio. 
RAY X22. Read. 
RADIO Go ahead, Ray. 
RAY I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over. 
RADIO Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.

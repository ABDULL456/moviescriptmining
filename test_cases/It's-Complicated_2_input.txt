JAKE What's the difference? I was drowning over there. I'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out. Janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work. 
JANE We can't, Jake. I told you this the other night. Please listen. 
JAKE But you were all pissy because you thought I stood you up. Things are different now. I'm a free man. (then) Can we just hug? I hate that you're being so distant. It's literally giving me a pain in my stomach. 
JANE Oh, God... 
Jane reluctantly hugs him.      He tries to kiss her. 
JANE See!    Too much! 
JAKE Okay!    Good note. 
Jane can't help but smile. 
JAKE Can I help with what you're doing? Hold your basket or... 
JANE I'm fine.... 
JAKE Okay... I'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight. We'll have movie night. Just like old times. How's that? I'll make the popcorn. Just then Jane's Cell RINGS. 
JANE Fine. (into phone) Hello... 
JAKE (whispers) I love knowing I'm coming back here. 
JANE (nods, turning slightly) Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout you? 
Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back. 
99    INT. FAMILY ROOM - JANE'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT                 99 The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low. Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls. 
ON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN 
BUCK HENERY Are you here for an affair, sir? 
DUSTIN What? 
BUCK HENRY The Singleman party, sir? 
Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing. He catches Jane's eye and mouths. 
JAKE I'M SO HAPPY!!! 
100   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT - EST.                 100 
101   INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                   101 Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the fridge. 
JAKE Any leftovers? 
GABBY Are you kidding? (takes out an armful of Tupperware) 
JAKE Any of that noodle thing left? (Gabby hands it to him.) Where's Mom? She disappeared so fast after the movie. 
GABBY She's probably sleeping. 
LUKE I think she's on her computer. 
They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various counters.

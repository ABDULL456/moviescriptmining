NORMAN Judith. And trust me, I've still got it. The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking back. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) I just can't find anyone that wants it. Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And looks crestfallen at what's on offer. 
8 INT/EXT. BEDROOM/STAIRS/HALL. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY 8 
MADGE is in her bedroom. She's arguing with her son-in-law CRAIG. Madge's suitcases are by the door. 
CRAIG This is crazy. You're crazy. You can't just up and leave like this. 
MADGE And yet if you watch me, that's exactly what you'll see happen. She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's daughter JESSICA is on the landing. 
JESSICA What's going on? 
CRAIG Your mother's lost it. 
JESSICA My mother never had it. 
CRAIG Talk to her. She doesn't listen to me. 
MADGE Nobody listens to you. She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow. 
MADGE (CONT'D) 
(TO JESSICA) It's one of the great mysteries of life that someone so vibrant and fascinating as my daughter should choose to spend her life with this fraction of a man. 
JESSICA I still don't understand what's going on. 
CRAIG I just asked her to babysit. And now she says she's leaving. They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children, LIAM and KATIE, are watching. 
JESSICA But you love babysitting. 
MADGE I loved it last night. 
LIAM We had pizza and stayed up late. 
MADGE And the night before. 
KATIE We had Chinese and stayed up late. 
LIAM If you don't go, tonight we could do a curry. 
MADGE It's tempting, my darlings, but you know why I must leave. 
LIAM We know. 
KATIE (to her parents) Being here is stopping her finding a husband. 
CRAIG Another one? 
LIAM AND KATIE Bye Granny. 
MADGE Don't let the buggers get you down. Madge turns to go. 
CRAIG How many husbands have you had, anyway? She turns back, smiles. 
MADGE Including my own? Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi. 
JESSICA Mother? Mother! 
9 INT/EXT. TAXI - DAY 9 
Moments later. Madge climbs into the back of the cab. 
TAXI DRIVER Name the place, darling. Where are you going? Madge smiles. 
MADGE I have absolutely no idea. 
10 INT. MANSION FLAT - DAY 10 
Evelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living room. Her son CHRISTOPHER is there. And her lawyer 
HAROLD. 
CHRISTOPHER There's no other way There just isn't. Harold told us this three months ago. 
HAROLD And I'm afraid matters have only got worse. 
8A. 
CHRISTOPHER We can't wait any longer. We need to put this flat on the market, and at least make a start at paying off Dad's debts.

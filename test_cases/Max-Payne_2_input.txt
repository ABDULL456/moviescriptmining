BB For what it's worth, he didn't know Michelle was going to die.

Max charges in, again firing on the man escaping... 
...but this time, we watch the glass behind the billowing curtains. The fabric ripples, revealing a reflection...

BB You really didn't know? 
With a shrug, BB turns away from Max's fury and moves on...

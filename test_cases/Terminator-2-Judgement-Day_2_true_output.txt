Dyson enters with Bryant.  Dyson and a GUARD stand together before what looks like a high-tech bank vault.  It requires two keys to open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo.  The guard and Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously.  Dyson then enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a sequence of clunks.  The door swings open and Dyson enters.  Bryant stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson's name and item on a clipboard. 
37      INT. VAULT 
Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it.  Inside is a small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas.  IT -- a ceramic rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver.  It has been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal frame. 
Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a specially-designed cart.  He handles it like the Turin Shroud. Dyson closes the cabinet.  Turns to the one next to it.  Opens its door.  In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND AND FOREARM. 
At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed.  But the forearm and hand are intact.  Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting.  This is all that remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed.  Dyson stares at it, lost in thought.  The he closes the cabinet, BLACKING OUT FRAME.

38      INT. INTERVIEW ROOM/OBSERVATION ROOM 
We can see through the one-way mirror into the interview room where Sarah is still talking with Silberman.  The OTHER PSYCHOLOGISTS are still watching through the mirror.  Reviewing Sarah's condition. 
SARAH So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I? 
SILBERMAN You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today. 
We go tight on Sarah's reaction.  And we see that Silberman is right. She was playing him and it didn't work.  And she knows she's fucked. Her tone becomes quite pleading. 
SARAH You have to let me see my son.  Please.  It's very important.  He's in danger.  At least let me call him -- 
Silberman pins her with his sweet reptilian gaze. 
SILBERMAN I'm afraid not.  Not for a while.  I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here another six months. 
Sarah's eyes turn cold and lethal in one second.  She knows she's lost.  She knows this guy is just playing with her, and she -- LEAPS ACROSS THE TABLE AT HIM. 
SARAH YOU SON OF A BITCH!! 
Silberman jumps back and the attendants dive on her.  She is writhing and twisting like a bobcat.  Silberman whips open a drawer and pulls out a syringe.  He jabs it into her and she yells -- 
SARAH Goddammit.  Let me go!!  Silberman!  You don't know what you're doing!  You fuck!  You're dead! You hear me!! 
Silberman signals and the attendants drag her out. He looks at the doctors behind the glass.  Shrugs. 
SILBERMAN Model citizen.

39      EXT. 7-ELEVEN STORE - DAY 
Officer X has stopped two young girls in front of a 7-Eleven.  He is leaning out the cruiser window and showing them the picture of John. The first girl nods. 
FIRST GIRL Yeah, he was here about fifteen minutes ago.  I think he said he was going to the Galleria. 
OFFICER X The what? 
The second girl points toward a massive complex visible about the houses several blocks away.  Officer X stares at it. 
40      EXT. STREET 
Terminator cruises slowly on the bike.  Scanning.  He crosses an overpass above a drainage canal and whips his head around at the sound of a dirt-bike engine. 
40A     TERMINATOR POV -- OF TWO KIDS ON A BIKE DOWN IN THE CANAL. THE IMAGE SNAP-ZOOMS IN.  FREEZES ON THE DRIVER'S FACE. "IDENT POS" FLASHES NEXT TO THE BLURRY IMAGE OF JOHN. 
40B     Terminator wheel the Harley around, cutting onto a street which runs parallel to the canal.  Terminator hauls ass at keep John in sight. He catches glimpses of the kid through trees and houses.  Loses him. Catches one last glimpse of him heading into the parking lot of a large SHOPPING MALL. 
41      INT. GALLERIA - DAY 
John works his way through a crowded video arcade.  Sees some guys he knows.  Stops to talk, striking a pose.  Mall rats in the element. We don't hear the dialogue. 
42      INT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT 
TERMINATOR'S idling Harley shakes the parking garage walls.  He stops at a row of bikes near the escalators.  John's little Honda sits proudly with the big street bikes.  Terminator parks. 
43      INT. GALLERIA 
OFFICER X is moving through the flow of shoppers.  The place is a zoo. He stops some kids and shows them the picture.  They shrug. 
43A     IN A CROWDED VIDEO ARCADE JOHN is lost in an intense battle, going for a new high score at "Missile Command".  He parries deftly at the enemy ICBMs deploy their MIRVs... the warheads stream down... it's more than he can deal with.  The world gets nuked.  Game over.  He slouches away from the game, looking for another.  Bored. 
RACK FOCUS to Officer X passing the entrance of the store behind him. The cop moves on, down the concourse, out of sight. John gets in an "Afterburner" simulator game.

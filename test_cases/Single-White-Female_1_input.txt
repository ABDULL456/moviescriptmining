The outer door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags. She opens the inner door and takes the keys Graham is giving her. 
ALLISON Friday ? 
GRAHAM That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back. 
Allison closes the inner door. ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Reverse angle shot of Allison closing the elevator inner door. The outer door closes automatically. Allison walks along the hall toward her apartment. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
The front door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags and enters the apartment. The front door closes behind her. She drops her keys on the little shelf by the door. She sees Hedra in the doorway of the living room. Her hair is in a bun. 
ALLISON Hey, I thought you'd be at work. 
HEDRA No. 
ALLISON Don't tell me we have the same belt. Hedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something. 
HEDRA Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you. 
ALLISON You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs. 
HEDRA Oh, they're great. 
ALLISON I had to get them. They're so great. 
HEDRA Can I just talk to you for a second... 
ALLISON Buddy ! 
Sam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms. 
HEDRA I tried to let you know. 
Sam puts the puppy on the floor. 
ALLISON What are you doing here ? Hedy ! 
SAM But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay. 
Hedra goes out of the hall into the living room. 
SAM I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you. Hedra comes back in the hall. 
HEDRA I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me... 
She looks back and forth to Allison and Sam, and gets just a «No» head-shake as an answer from Allison. 
HEDRA Okay. 
Hedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her. 
ALLISON Why can't you just leave me alone ? 
Allison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen. 
SAM You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I don't exist. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison puts her bags down on a table. 
ALLISON Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me ? 
SAM But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters. 
ALLISON Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ? Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away. 
SAM Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't one of them. 
ALLISON Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it. 
SAM Well, I sent it with the keys. 
ALLISON Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ? 
SAM Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you. I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me a second chance. 
She goes into his arms. He hugs her. She start crying. 
ALLISON You really hurt me, Sam. 
SAM Shhh !

ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra is standing by the window, with a knee on the heater. She seems very pensive. 
An old lady comes out of the elevator, and looks at Hedra. Hedra turns her head toward the lady. She picks up her bag, which was sitting on the heater beside her, and moves away from the window. She goes to the elevator and presses the call button.

CONTINUED: Jake tries a reassuring smile even though he's not sure it's something he should be smiling about. The spoon starts to RATTLE again as another subway train RUMBLES in the distance. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY-NIGHT (PRESENT) Lily shakes her head in disbelief that Jake would tell the story. JAKE Sorry, honey. But I figure if we can't all share at a time like this... Butch lowers the gun down and looks over at Lily. BUTCH You got some issues, huh? LILY (with a hiss) I can take care of myself. Butch freezes as A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the BACKGROUND, growing CLOSER then FADING again. He puts the gun back to Jake's head. BUTCH Hurry up. CUT TO: INT.- ASHBY'S OFFICE- DAY Ashby sits behind a desk in front of the crew.     In front of him are the corporate papers. JAKE (V.O.) We had to finalize the deal. ASHBY Everything looks in order. JAKE This has to happen fast. ASHBY I know.   It won't go unnoticed. JAKE There'll be red flags. Jake slides an envelope across the desk.

CONTINUED: ASHBY What's this? JAKE You need some convincing.       Consider it a convincer. Ashby leafs through the money in the envelope. ASHBY Let's just slow down for a second... JAKE You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you. ASHBY No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut. ECU- A bead of sweat rolls down the back of Ashby's neck. JAKE (V.O.) Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch. JAKE The standard ten. ASHBY Ten percent.     Of how much? JAKE Two million. GORDO We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over. JAKE And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow. There's a pause before Ashby smiles, then reaches around to scratch his neck. CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/HALLWAY- DAY Jake exits Ashby's office with Lupus, Gordo, Miles and Lily. They all follow Jake down the hallway.

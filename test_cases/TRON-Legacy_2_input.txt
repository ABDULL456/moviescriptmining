Rush hurries away with Mega and Flynn. 
Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred X-Takks. 
KROD Whoa! Retreat! That way!     Keep firing! RUN! AHHH! 
Plexor enters the battle arena with his four CYBAVORS.     He scans keenly, then heads off another direction. 
127   INT.   X-NET GANTRY / MAIN POWER SUPPLY 
Flynn hobbles, helped by Mega.     Rush leads them around a corner, in sight of: 
MAIN POWER SUPPLY.     Massive reactive CORE CONTAINMENT CUBE. 
Rush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat. Bottom is      a channel of ROILING, MOLTEN CHROMATIC DATA. No bridges. 
RUSH We have to get across. 
RAAAA!!! 
Six X-Takks are upon them, disks flying, NegaByte eraser beams swinging. 
Flynn Takes a hit in the chest. 
FLYNN ARRGGHH! 
Rush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy - 
X-Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing as they hit the molten bottom. 
128   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER CORRIDORS 
Krod, Boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of X-Takks, Code Monkeys spring a DEGAUSSING CHARGE, which cuts off a column at the base. Column tumbles, crashing X-Takks, blocking the way. 
High fives among Krod and Fighters. 
One Small X-Takk breaks through, ZAPPING through the air, reforming, ZAPPING CLOSER. 
Fighters turn to blast him. 
But Krod recognizes the pattern: 
KROD Wait!     I know that dude! 
Quantz stuns an X-Takk Soldier - Code Monkeys hack his X-Net Armor. Armor powers down, revealing: 
KROD I-beem! 
I-beem shakes off his brainwashing. 
(CONTINUED) 
128   CONTINUED: 
I-BEEM Krod my friend! Who are these guys?! 
KROD We're taking out Plexor.    You with us or them? 
X-Takks attack the group, including I-beem. 
I-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk. He steals the X-Takk's NEGABYTE BLASTER and mows down three X-Takks, saving trapped Boole. 
I-BEEM With you! 
I-beem joins Fighters as they press deeper, engaging the next X-Takk onslaught. 
129   INT.   X-NET POWER SUPPLY OUTER GANTRY - CONTINUOUS 
Rush and Mega haul Flynn along a narrow ledge. 
FLYNN There.   You can make it across! 
He points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below. 
Rush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather Flynn for a vault-crossing. 
FLYNN No, take Mega! I'll stay here and run interference. 
RUSH You haven't got a chance by yourself. 
FLYNN Ah, these guys are wimps. 
It's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself. 
MEGA We're not leaving you. 
FLYNN My body is weak, but my will is strong. I promise, no matter what they do to me, I'll survive this. Trust the bigger plan. 
(CONTINUED) 
129   CONTINUED: 
He's fading fast. 
MEGA But Flynn - 
X-Takks attack along the ledge. 
FLYNN GO!   NOW! 
Rush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat, landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a core ENTRY POINT. 
Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble into the moat, flashing as they hit.

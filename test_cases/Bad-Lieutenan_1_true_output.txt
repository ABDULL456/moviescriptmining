MOB VOICE (OC) No. 
LT Look, man. Lite gave ne this number. OK? Just take a message. Tell Large to fucking call me right away at 123- 1234. Got it? 
MOB VOICE (CO -- phony humble) Sure, I get it... (laughs) 
LT I'm a good friend of Lite's, man. It's urgent that -- 
The MOB VOICE (CO) HANGS UP ON LT. 
LT tries to strangle the PHONE. 
LT REDIALS. 
The line is BUSY. 
LT Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands. 
ARIANE Who? 
LT Those fucking Mob assholes. 
LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at him. 
ARIANE C'mere. You got some good blow, right? 
LT Yeah. 
ARIANE Then c'mere. I got something for you. 
ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE.  LT comes but flinches at the sight. 
Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY appears out of the KITCHEN. 
BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE. 
ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc. 
ARIANE First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... (beat -- she leans in) First time shooting up? 
LT Nah... 
ARIANE Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you. 
That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE and HEROIN.

Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the window. Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw. Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light. 
BOB We back in business? 
MICHAEL I don't think so. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME 
The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the dramatic change. 
AUDREY Is it over? 
KYLE I don't know. HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway. 
KYLE (raising his gun) You better get downstairs. 
AUDREY No, I can handle it. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he pulls out his silver 45. 
KYLE (handing her the gun) Just in case. The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps. 
KYLE Get ready. They aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car. He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car. 
He races around to the gas pump. 
KYLE (lowering his gun) Wait a minute. 
AUDREY Kyle, are they... A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner. AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the pump. Flips the lever. 
KYLE It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap! Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family. 
KYLE AND AUDREY Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a trap! But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING WIND as he pumps the gas. Kyle fires his gun in the air.   BLAM!   BLAM!     BLAM! At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof.   His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner. 
AUDREY They're not gonna make it. The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the door. But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM. His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from the vehicle by skeletal hands. 
AUDREY (pushing his barrel down) Wait! You'll hit them too! So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the ground in front of the diner. 
AUDREY Kyle! Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on. He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything that comes at him. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward the pumps. 
BOB Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'! 
CHARLIE We have to get `im back in here! Bob springs into action.   Pushes the booth away from the front door. The sound of a gun COCKING. Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head. 
MICHAEL Don't. You open that door and we could all be dead.

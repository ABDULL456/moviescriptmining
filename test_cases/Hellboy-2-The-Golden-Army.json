On the lampposts, Xmas lights sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines line up for a public function. \n2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2 \nSUPERIMPOSURE: \nBLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE. A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as- The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the security people at the door. \nSHADOWY FIGURE (in Elvish, subtitled) I'll go up first. You'll enter from below- He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth. \nSHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D) And remember Wink- \n(BEAT) Don't be shy. He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall, up, up, like a bat. Five floors up... \n3 INT. SALES ROOM - NIGHT \nCAMERA lingers on the bloated features of a stone FERTILITY \nGODDESS. \nHELLBOY 2 2 \nAUCTIONEER Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite and has been dated circa 700 B.C. Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear. TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders can have a closer look. \nAUCTIONEER (CONT'D) We'll open the bidding at two hundred thousand dollars.

CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4 \n-a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots to and from the sales room. The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a snow-covered alley. Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame, clinging to the smooth granite wall!! \nSTEWARD What the h- Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has \nVANISHED!!! The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels, hauling him outside and dangling him over the void. Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence. \nHELLBOY 2 3 \nSHADOWY FIGURE A silent human- almost as good as a dead one... \n(BEAT) Almost. He releases the STEWARD, who falls- \n-DOWN- \n-DOWN- -down- TKKCT!!! Flailing in utter silence. All the way. Onto the fence. The Figure slips through the window and moves into the- \n5 INT.

The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the audience. \n9 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 9 \nHB stumbles around the rubble, wreathed in smoke. He holds a bunch of blackened LPs and 8-track cassettes. \nHELLBOY (yelling at Liz) Look- I have one rule! One- \"Don't touch my stuff -\" Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame. HB's pulls a few LP albums out of the garbage bin. \nLIZ You have the same album on CD, LP and an 8 track- An 8 track!!! \nHELLBOY You can't listen to Al Green on a CD!! You just can't!! Oh, and 8 track was the way to go- one day mankind will realize its mistake. \nLIZ What about me? I need some space! Not much, but just enough to find- to find- my- toothbrush. She flares up, losing control... \nHELLBOY Is that what this is about?? Your toothbrush's right there, behind you- (Liz turns) There- there- with the cat food!! Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from a heap of spilled cat kibble. \nLIZ Damn it, Red- there's no room for me here. You can't just act like- Suddenly, the alarm SOUNDS. Hellboy is elated. \nBELLBOY 2 8 \nHELLBOY Oh, heavenly bells are ringing! \n10 INT. GARAGE WEAPONS AREA, BPRD - NIGHT \nSurrounded by racks of weapons, Abe, Hellboy and Liz suit up. Tight-lipped and grumpy, Liz dons black army pants and a leather jacket. She jams an automatic handgun into her utility belt. They move into a vast garage, big as a stadium. It houses a fleet of planes, cars, boats, helicopters and tanks. They load weapons and ammo on board their usual transport/mobile quarters - a GARBAGE TRUCK. The perfect gentleman, Hellboy holds the door open for Liz. The truck interior has been refurbished with more high-tech equipment. As the engine starts and the headlights blaze... \nCUT TO: \n- NIGHT 11 \n11 EXT. EAST SIDE AUCTION HOUSE \nThe cops have surrounded the building and helicopters hover overhead. \n12 EXT. NEARBY ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe BPRD garbage truck pulls to stop. \n13 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT \nCompletely refurbished, with a BANK OF MONITORS and a large digital WORLD MAP, tracking each Paranormal. \nMANNING Oh, Jeez- did you see the crowds? He offers HB a couple of cigars and lights one for him. \nMANNING This is midtown Manhattan... Will you promise to be careful? You'll use discretion? \nHELLBOY 2 9 \nHELLBOY Piece of cake. In and out... no one will see me. You have my word- A sarcastic guffaw from Liz. \nHELLBOY (CONT'D) \n(GLARING) I can be discreet if I want to be- They exit the truck and enter the building. Manning sighs. \nCUT TO: \n14 TNT. SALES ROOM - NIGHT 14 A BPRD agent (AGENT MUDD), Abe and Liz move into the big, dark sales room, past a jumble of overturned chairs. They use plasma-screen night-vision scanners to survey the devastation. \nLIZ No one here. No survivors. No bodies. \nNOTHING- \n15 TNT. CORRIDOR - SAME 15 Two agents lead the way down the adjacent hallway. Hellboy follows, a few feet behind. HB trains his flashlight on a fallen display case. Broken glass glitters. \nHELLBOY Same story here, babe- \nLIZ (on the intercom) Don't call me babe- \n19 EXT. EAST SIDE AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT 19 \nManning is holding forth in a sidewalk press conference. \nMANNING The situation is completely under control. Earlier tonight, customs agents discovered a few illegally imported items. This caused a minor confrontation. The reporters go wild with questions. \nMANNING (CONT'D) Federal agents have now taken over the premises. We ask that you all step back- Manning basks in the flashbulb glow and acknowledges a pretty young REPORTER. \nHELLBOY 2 12 \nMANNING (CONT'D) \n(GRINS) Yes, Debra-? \n20 TNT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 20 Plaster spills from widening cracks in the wall. Hellboy shoots, blowing open a massive hole. He peeks inside- Small bodies burrow away like moles. \nHELLBOY What are they-? Abe? \n21 INT. INTERCUT - SALES ROOM/CORRIDOR - SAME 21 \nAbe finds a human femur, wet and gnawed. \nABE Ah, I knew it. \n(BEAT ) They're vicious and cruel and- The floor ripples with activity. \nABE (CONT'D) Have you noticed the floor?? \nHELLBOY (looking around) Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown- \nABE Red- there is no rug- Hellboy lifts his foot, realizing he's been walking on an inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo. \nHELLBOY Aw, crap- \nABE Precisely... \n(BEAT) These things have a very active metabolism. They, um- excrete as soon as they eat and then need to eat some more. There are no corpses 'cause there are no \nLEFTOVERS- \nHELLBOY 2 13 \nHELLBOY Spit it out, brother blue. What are they? \n22 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME 22 \nABE Alright, but- \nLIZ Damn it Abe, just tell us! \nABE Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies. \nLIZ Abe, c'mon- cut the crap. She checks her boots, sticky with poo- \nABE Third century, the Teutoburg forest. Famished. They feed on calcium- \n(BEAT) And they do go for the teeth first. How do you think they got that name \"Tooth Fairies\"?? Liz senses movement in the darkness. She holds out her hand and starts a small fire on her palm. She pans it like a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness- \nNOTHING- \n23 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 23 \nAgent MARBLE comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out from a crack in the wall. It's about 9 inches high, with olive skin and almond-shaped eyes gleaming in the half- light. It whimpers softly. \nAGENT MARBLE Hey, this guy is cute -i. He reaches out to touch it. \nLIZ \n(YELLING) No, Red- Not there! Move away from the- K-B00000MMMMMM`IN!!!!!!!!! A massive explosion- \n29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29 Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window. A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting, writhing fairies. Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands in their midst, cracking the pavement. \n30 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME \nLiz and Abe go to the window and look down. A TV CAMERA LENS \nZOOMS IN ON THEM BOTH. \nHELLBOY 2 17 \nLIZ (into her radio) HB?? HB?? Are you alright?? \n31 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 31 \nThe crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd. People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters jumps at a woman but- BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and efficiently shoots its fellows. Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds it up by the tail, like a rodent. Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy. \nHELLBOY (looks at Manning) Gee whiz, Manning- \n(SHRUGS) I guess we're out now. \nCUT TO: \n32 CREDITS 32 Behind the CREDITS are caballistic engravings suggesting the power, size and weapons of a mystic, mechanical GOLDEN ARMY. \nCUT TO: \n33 EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - NIGHT 33 \nSUPERIMPOSURE: \nWEST SIDE RAILYARDS. MIDNIGHT Demolition has begun on abandoned factories and rail sheds around an old ROUNDHOUSE. A sign reads: COMING NEXT SUMMER, \nTHREE POINTS SHOPPING MALL. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to a guard shack. \nHELLBOY 2 18 \n34 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT 34 \nGuard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press and TV. \nGUARD 1 Check it out. That guy's make-up is so fake. I mean, come on, solid red- Guard 2 is cleaning his gun. \nGUARD 2 And what's with his forehead? Is that goggles? He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE standing by the gates. \nGUARD 2 (CONT'D) Hey, we got us a wino. He grabs his nightstick and steps outside. \n35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT \nWaving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder. Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall. \nGUARD 2 Hey- buddy- get the- The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the guard. The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts and collapses. \n36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT \nGuard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside- -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!! \nBAMMKM ! ! ! ! THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard. WINK emerges from behind the shack. \nHELLBOY 2 19 Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and follows him through. \n37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37 \nKING Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no choice. (looks at his guards) Death. His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords. \nPRINCE \n(GRIM) I agree. Death it is- And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards. \nPRINCE Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you that have already seen the light- (he nears the guards) Seen the future... The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to his Father\"s corpse and snatches the medallion. \nPRINCE (CONT'D) As for you- You may join us in our quest or die now- His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together, they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises \nIT- \nPRINCE (CONT'D) All of those in favor, make it known. \nHELLBOY 2 23 All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then kneel. \nPRINCE (CONT'D) Good- I see the council is as brave as it's always been... \n(BEAT) And now, my sister- The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone. He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door. \nPRINCE (CONT'D) Find her- Find her- His minions surge into the tunnels. \n40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40 Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel. With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down a chute. She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves. \n41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41 \nThe Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an ancient, leather-bound tome. She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty sword. It opens a gash in the princess' left arm- \n42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42 \nThe Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a wound in his left arm. \nPRINCE No- no- you fools- \nHELLBOY 2 24 \n43 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 43 \nAs another troll lifts his sword high- \nPRINCESS (calling out) Yrdrig!! YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In seconds, he's upon the TROLLS. Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls. The Princess slips through a secret door. \n44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44 \nThe Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll screams echo off the walls. When they finally- \n45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45 \n-reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late. Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor. The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his bleeding arm. \nCUT TO: \n46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46 \nLiz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of Heliboy's \"outing\" the night before. HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph! \nHELLBOY ON TV Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've fought many creatures over the years but none as strong as me- He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes. \nHELLBOY 2 25 Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of beer. \nHELLBOY I think I did good. And I looked good, don't you think, Liz? Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls. \nABE Look- there's Manning... He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by microphones. \nMANNING ON TV Evidently we have a- gas pocket- somewhere in- \nLIZ Not just him- this whole thing you did. The TV- the reporters- \nHELLBOY I did that? \nLIZ Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it without thinking- You just wanted to be in the public's eye- well- you're there- but so are we. \nHELLBOY Hey- We got some hate mail. \n(SHRUGS) We'll deal with it. Together. \nHELLBOY 2 33 He comes closer to her. \nHELLBOY Something else bothering you-? Liz nods quietly. \nHELLBOY So- Tell me about it- \nLIZ I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I- \n(BEAT) I don't like being watched. I never have. I feel like a freak only if someone's watching me. Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and fenders. The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally, hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan, UK, Germany... \nCUT TO: \n52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52 \nAgents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy. Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying support/hatred signs. \nMANNING May I suggest that tonight you refrain from signing autographs. \nHELLBOY It's the garbage truck. It makes the wrong statement. About who we are. \nMANNING You think that's what this is about? Transportation??? \nHELLBOY 2 34 \n53 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS - NIGHT 53 \nThe truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge. At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs. Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage. \nREPORTER 2 C'mon- show us your powers- \nABE Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick. \nREPORTER 1 What are you, a mermaid?? \nABE Oh, goodness, no- I- \nREPORTER 2 You say you can read things- things about people- so read me- c'mon- read me- The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds. \nREPORTER 2 (CONT'D) What do you see? \nABE Very well, if you insist. (webbed hand on reporter's chest) You... keep... a large, battery-operated vibrating egg by your bedside... A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment. \nREPORTER You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test? \nHELLBOY It's \"Hellboy\" not \"Demon-man\"- One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy gazes back at them- seething. \nJOHANN Let me take care of this. Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd. \nHELLBOY 2 35 \nJOHANN (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann Kraus and I beg you to allow us- (interrupted by catcalls) -Please, we need space to work- please- \nWE- The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for silence. \nJOHANN (CONT'D) In due time- very soon- we will provide all the answers you require, all the whos, whys and wherefors- But for now- An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars- \nABE (CONT'D) Oh, my- The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet - into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He groans. \nHELLBOY Abe? What's wrong? \nHELLBOY 2 44 Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the cobblestones. \nHELLBOY \n(INTERCOM) Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit - \n72 EXT. SHOP - SAME 72 \nThe locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann look at each other. Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the crowd. \n73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73 \nAbe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt- It's not there. \nPRINCESS If you are looking for your weapons, my guards took them. Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in fine silk robes. She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large, featherless REPTILE/BIRDS. \nABE I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure you... \nPRINCESS Why were you following me? Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly beguiled by her. \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) Are you seeking to join my brother? \nABE Your brother-?? \nHELLBOY 2 45 \nPRINCESS In his revolt against the humans? \nABE A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely mistaken... He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere, barking and growling. \nPRINCESS Then answer me truthfully- Why were you following me? \nABE My name is Abe Sapien - \nPRINCESS \n(LAUGHING) There is no such name! \nABE Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. If we can assist you- \nPRINCESS Give me your hand. Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his palm. The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for the YRDRIG to yield. \nPRINCESS Down Yrdrig - he's a friend. The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all three tongues. \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) Yrdrig's really just a puppy. The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw. \nABE \n(WHEEZING) Nice puppy... \nA The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him playful shake. \nHELLBOY 2 46 \nPRINCESS My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave our guest alone- The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor. \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig! As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up- \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) (bows her head) My name is Princess Nuala. \nABE (bows his head) Your highness, the honor is all mine. \n77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77 \nLit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted onto tall, ornate, golden figures. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) This was an army that would not eat, drink or grow tired. A heartless, ruthless force made of the purest metal, mined from the depths of the earth. \n78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78 \nIn perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's command. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) The Sigri worked until the winter moon was high in the sky - The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN directly over the King's head. \nKING I am King Balor, leader of the Golden Army. Is there anyone here who disputes my right??? Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response- TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him. \n79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79 \nAs the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles with the arms of the approaching troops. \nHELLBOY 2 50 \n80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80 \nThe fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by battle axes, bludgeons and lances. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) But this army knew no bounds, had no remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in blind battle with man, woman or child. The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise. The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine devouring tender flesh. At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And as the king gazed upon the earth awash in blood and at the impassive metal faces of the army he had created, his heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at too high a price. This war should never have been waged. The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And so he arranged a truce: the surviving men would keep to their cities and we children of the Earth would dwell within the forests. This pact, he declared, would be honored by our sons and the sons of their sons until the end of time. Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) But my brother did not believe in the promises of men. He marched off into exile, vowing to return if the Sons of the Earth ever needed him. Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset. \n81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT \nThe goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under the light of ten thousand flickering torches. \nHELLBOY 2 51 \nPRINCESS (V.0.) And the golden army was ordered to lie dormant, locked inside the earth itself - and there it is to this day, waiting for the wearer of the crown to command it again. \n82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82 \nThe Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at each other. \nHELLBOY Where is that crown?? \nPRINCESS My father had it destroyed. Cut into three pieces. One for mankind... She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a chain around her neck. \nPRINCESS .Two for the sons of the Earth. \nABE So, you do need our help..? \nPRINCESS I'm afraid it's the other way around. She holds the CYLINDER she purchased. \nPRINCESS The location of the Golden Army is contained within this cylinder-- She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She extends it: the map just shows three coordinates. \nABE Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here- \nPRINCESS But nothing else- She rolls back the map into the cylinder. \nPRINCESS So far, this is a family matter. To intervene will bring nothing but trouble. \nHELLBOY 2 52 \nHELLBOY Good, I like trouble. \nABE Do as I say! With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few. \nABE How many do you have? \nHELLBOY Three, how about you? \nABE Three! There's always seven! Find the last one!!! \nTO The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer edge... \nABE Quick, it's going for water! Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH. \nABE (CONT'D) Oh, my God, evacuate the area! \nHELLBOY 2 56 \nHELLBOY Abe, please, get a grip. A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM! A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping up through the Bridge overpass!! Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into the moonlit clouds. Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden. \nHELLBOY (CONT'D) Whoa. Just like the story books. Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her \"ala\" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd starts wandering into this idyllic scenario. \nLIZ This is so beautiful- \nMANNING So- perfect- so peaceful- \nHELLBOY Hey!!! He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it- \nHELLBOY Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh- Jeez did you have to do that?? Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd- \nLIZ Back- Go back- right now!!! \nMANNING What? What? What is he doing-? \nLIZ He's knocking on wood- summoning an \nELEMENTAL- \nHELLBOY 2 57 \nMANNING An elem- \nLIZ A forest spirit that lives in that tree. He's releasing it- \nMANNING Oh, and is it that bad?? KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape descends. BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant \nELEMENTAL. Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out of the tree and stares at Hellboy. Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK! WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight, turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel. \nHELLBOY Good dog. (to Elemental) Now, Woody... You want to fight someone, you fight with me. Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee. The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off. \nABE (to the Princess) This may not be the best place for you, your majesty. With your permission... He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the ground where they had been standing! Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord. Johann sees this- \nHELLBOY 2 58 \nJOHANN I have a plan- He looks at Abe- \n87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87 -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the BPRD garbage truck. Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine. \n88 ABANDONED BUILDING \nHellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing and discarding branches and roots. \n89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89 \nHellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN. Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a corridor littered with debris. Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section of the corridor as Hellboy runs. \n90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90 \nPRINCE (to the Elemental) Over here, dear friend... SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages. \nHELLBOY 2 62 The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel spire, his coat flapping in the night wind. \nPRINCE This might be a good chance for you to come to your senses. Help us. \nHELLBOY I've been all through this! The answer's still no! Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable, bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a steel snake! The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable \nTENSES- \nJOHANN (to Liz) Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet. Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he tosses Hellboy high into the air. On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the Elemental's back, right behind his head. \nHELLBOY Nap time, Big guy- He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back of the neck. The cable tenses- -The Elemental pitches forward- The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at him; his mouth opens as if to scream... The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing. Putting an end, it seems, to both of them. \nHELLBOY 2 63 The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change. Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges, bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly, laughing and happy to be together. Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at him... Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance, jealous, alone. \nCUT TO: \n99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99 \nBLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a button, brings the paper close for inspection. Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye. Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke. \nJOHANN You'll permit a small criticism? You take too much time to aim, to think. Nein. Just point- like afinger- as if you wish for something. \nHELLBOY Oh, I wish for something. Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster of shots, dead center. \nJOHANN Speed is of the essence. You must work on it. I'm willing to spend some - Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's onto the floor. \nHELLBOY Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I don't like it. \nHELLBOY 2 64 \nJOHANN On the contrary. \n100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100 \nHellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a terry cloth towel. \nHELLBOY You keep wiping that thing like she's gonna care. \nJOHANN She- Who-?? \nHELLBOY You know who- She- \n(BEAT) She's not gonna care. \nJOHANN (long beat) You think I'm after Liz, don't you? (Hellboy walks out) Well, I'm not. \nHELLBOY Why not? \n(BEAT) Not good enough for you? Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind Johann. \nHELLBOY Well- From now on, you don't come near her. You don't talk to her- \nJOHANN You forget. I'm part of the team now, such interactions are inev- \nHELLBOY Well- you better start making them \"evitable\"- \nJOHANN That's not a word- \nHELLBOY Yes, it is- \nHELLBOY 2 65 \nJOHANN No, it isn't- Hellboy raises his stone fist. \n102 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLiz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV programming. \nHELLBOY He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him next time. He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc. \nLIZ There shouldn't be a \"next time\" we're all part of the same team. \nHELLBOY 2 68 \nHELLBOY We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac. You can see right through him. \n(PAUSE) That's a joke, Liz. Liz remains silent. \nHELLBOY (raises a letter) Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series, based on me? And this: (he holds up a box of cereal) Product endorsement - breakfast of demons. And a videogame!!! As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume up. \nLIZ Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It always gets me- Red- There's something I need to- \nHELLBOY (taking the remote) No, wait. (switching to Leno) Look that's us- Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident. \nLENO So- this \"Hellboy\" what is he?? Is he really on our side?? I mean, he's red, has a tail and shaves his horns- horns, Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a good sign. \nHELLBOY \n(CHUCKLES) Ha- He's funny. \nLENO Maybe we should have him come over and talk to us a little, uh? Whaddayathink?? The crowd roars. \nHELLBOY That's a great idea, don't you think?? \nHELLBOY 2 69 \nLIZ No, I don't- \nHELLBOY Did you know that during the commercial breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the conversation fresh. \nLIZ How do you know these things? \nHELLBOY I read it in TV Guide. \nLIZ You're really liking this, aren't you? \nHELLBOY We should do this- \nLIZ It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really need everybody to like you?? What's in it for you?? Are we not enough??? She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles. \nHELLBOY That's funny. \nCUT TO: \n103 EXT. BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 103 \nLiz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann approaches her. \nJOHANN Are you alright-? Liz nods weakly. \nJOHANN May I be of assistance?? \nLIZ Maybe. \nHELLBOY 2 70 \nJOHANN He's a big brute, isn't he?? Liz chuckles. \nJOHANN But he has a good heart. I know it. He means well. \nHELLBOY Liz and I- we had a fight- \nABE \nOH- Hellboy eyes the CD player. \nHELLBOY Did I hear Barry Manilow just now? \nABE (smiles hypocritical) Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no- (fast, stammering) It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia I believe I particularly admire the passage... Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer. \nHELLBOY What's happening to you?? \nABE Ooh- Ooh- \n(SIGHS) All my life I thought I was alone, a made- up name and a random pasted on a cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like me. A creature from another world... Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in love. \nHELLBOY You say that like it's a good thing. (looks at the CD) What track? \nABE \n(ASHAMED) Track eight- \nHELLBOY \n(READS) Oh, God- you're disgusting- \nABE I know- \nHELLBOY 2 74 \nHELLBOY \"Can't smile without you\" \nABE I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for it.. \n(DESPERATE) What am I going to do, Red???? Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs heavily, looks around- \nABE I miss him- Father- don't you?? \nHELLBOY \n(NODS) Everyday. \nABE He would tell what to do- He would tell what's right- what's wrong- \nHELLBOY He did that for all of us... The opening strings of \"Can't Smile Without You.\" \nABE (sips beer) You know? I- I never much appreciated Manilow's artistry that much- until now- Now it seems to be a grand poet and speaks directly to my innermost feelings. \nHELLBOY Jeez- You need to get out more- The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing: low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and teary-eyed. \n110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT \nThe Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the distant city lights below... \nHELLBOY 2 75 \nEXT. BPRD - NIGHT 111 \nThe music can be heard at a distance. A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the building. \nCUT TO: \n112 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - DAY \nManning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS. \nMAKEUP GIRL They said, you're too normal. You don't need anything. \nMANNING But- Believe me- I'm not normal at all... \nCAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe. \nMAKEUP GIRL 2 So, what color is that- green? \nABE Carribbean Blue, actually. CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest. \nMAKEUP GIRL 3 Are these really scars? \nHELLBOY Well, yeah. Each one tells a story- His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly gets up and goes to them. \nHELLBOY 2 78 \nHELLBOY That about you, glass-man? A few squirts of Windex? \nJOHANN I'm not going on. And if I may- a word of \nADVICE- (long beat, then sotto voce) -it's not a good idea to hint that you two have... a relationship. \nHELLBOY Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that. \nJOHANN You don't know how people may react. \nHELLBOY It's a love story. They'll lap it up. \nJOHANN I know you don't like me, but trust me on this one. \n(BEAT) I knew your father- he was a friend- Hellboy blinks, taking the information in. \nJOHANN Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't have approved of your behaviour. A P.A. opens the door. \nP.A. You're on-! \nJOHANN I'll be watching from the truck lab, where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen minutes... He walks away. \nCUT TO: \n116 INT. MOSCOW SUBWAY - NIGHT \nSIGN: PATROVICK STATION, MOSCOW, 22.00 HOURS. A busy Moscow Subway station, not very crowded at this time of night. Sleepy patrons await the arrival of the subway. \nHELLBOY 2 79 One of them, a puppet vendor, showcases his product. He manipulates a wooden marionette: A KNIGHT in SHINING ARMOR. In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train ROAR!!! The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The lights grow in intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But something's wrong, really, wrong- \nPUPPETEER Hooy na ny! The lights are in reality, the eyes of a giant dragon and it roars into the platfrom, demolishing pillars, crushing people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second. Pandemonium ensues. \n117 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT \nA warning light goes off on the Truck's GLOBAL POSITIONING \nMAP: \"MOSCOW\" But Johann and the other agents are too absorbed watching the Leno show on the bank of monitors. \nLENO Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we saw some extraordinary things on TV. And tonight you're in for more. \nCUT TO: \n118 TV SHOW Jay Leno grins and pulls his microphone close. \nLENO Please extend a warm, warm welcome to Hellboy, Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, and Special Agent Tom Manning. Uproarious applause as the BPRD team comes out and make their way to the couch. \n119 INT. BPRD CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME \nAlone in the BPRD conference room, the Princess is watching the show. The massive Yrdrig is curled up at her feet. \nCUT TO: \n123 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - SAME 123 \nRed Square, Moscow now seen in similar, shaky video. Hundreds of citizens are running from a towering, DRAGON. \nANNOUNCER 2 This is CNN in Moscow, where a Dragon has laid claim to Red Square. Yes- a DRAGON. \nHELLBOY 2 83 The DRAGON heads towards the TV REPORTER and screeching, it raises its PAW. \nANNOUNCER 2 Oh, my God... CAMERA goes down, then the picture winks out. Black screen. The HISS of static... PAN off the monitor to Jay Leno, who sits in stunned silence, like everyone else. Finally, he looks over at Hellboy. \nLENO Friends of yours? \nHELLBOY \n(GROWL) No -! \nLENO Then, may I ask what you're doing here? Shouldn't you be out protecting humanity instead of hooking up with our women? At last, Hellboy explodes. Bellowing, he rips up the desk and throws it through the backdrop! \nCUT TO: \n124 TNT. BPRD - SAME The Princess snaps off the TV, looking worried. Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes and shudders - trouble is near. The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers. \n125 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nVideo cameras record the journey of the Princess as she makes her way through the nearly-deserted corridors. \n126 TNT. LIBRARY -- CONTINUOUS 126 A VIDEO surveillance camera in the BPRD library records the Princess as she crosses to Abe's tank. \nBELLBOY 2 84 She hides the gold segment within the pages of \"Jane Eyre.\" At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS - \nPRINCESS Shhh, it's all right - BOOM-! A jolt shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall collapses as warty, heavily muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at the masonry! in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly. Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging. The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs. With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice: \nPRINCE Hold. The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear. The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him. \nPRINCE Come-! The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince. The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and brutally twists -! The animal's three mouths yelp and cough, fighting for air. - the It thrashes pathetically until, suddenly, it's over beast is dead. \nPRINCESS No! \nPRINCE Where is your sense of shame? You mingle with... the liars? \n127 INT. BPRD GARAGE - SAME 127 \nALARMS are ringing as the Hummers pull into the underground parking garage. Manning and Hellboy jump out of their vehicle and see - \nHELLBOY 2 85 - a couple of dead AGENTS sprawled on the loading dock. \nMANNING What in God's name- ? Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing into the building. The alarm bells are deafening. \n128 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR 128 \nHellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying on the floor, wounded and confused. \n129 INT. LOBBY 129 \nThe top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his drooling bodyguards. Standoff. As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair. \nABE Princess! Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest- \nHELLBOY Abe! No, get back!! Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy manages to restrain him. \nPRINCESS Mr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you! \nPRINCE I'll kill you all, if that's what you want. \nHELLBOY 2 89 \n135 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 135 \nAbe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins of his tank. He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of \"Jane Eyre.\" He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece. \nLIZ Any luck? Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious thing in his webbed hand. \nABE No. Sorry. \nLIZ It doesn't matter. \nABE No -? \nLIZ No. Forget the gold piece. Let's us just find this royal asshole. \n(FIERCE) Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We'll kick his ass. Abe looks supremely troubled. \nLIZ Abe, let's do this for Red! Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck the gold piece into his belt. \nCUT TO: \n136 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 136 \nAbe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of the Princess' map from the troll market. His finger traces the strange, elvish text. \nHELLBOY 2 90 \nABE The map contained within the cylinder seems useless- \n(BEAT) Now the case itself proves very useful- He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs and coordinates become visible. A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too. \nABE Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her brother were born there. They hold it sacred. \nMANNING Even if you're right, we sit tight and locate the gold piece, make sure he never ever gets his hands on it. If there's any truth to this legend, the fate of the world depends on it. \nLIZ What about Red?? Don't you care about him??? A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally: \nJOHANN Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is right: we can't take the chance. Liz glares at him. \nLIZ I see. Red was right about you. Welcome to the team, Johann. And goodbye. She leaves the room. \nCUT TO: \n137 INT. HB'S ROOM - LATER 137 \nHellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room. His cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain. He sits by the bed. Liz enters the room. He smiles weakly at her- \nHELLBOY 2 91 \nHELLBOY Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be \nALRIGHT- Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed. \nABE We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You are right, Liz- We should just do this together: the three of us. Liz smiles. \nCUT TO: \n138 INT. PLANE - NIGHT 138 \nThe BPRD airplane sits quietly in its hangar. In the passenger compartment, Hellboy climbs up. He looks up to see Liz smiling down at him. \n139 INT. COCKPIT - SAME 139 \nAbe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the massive airplane manual. \n148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148 The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and \nJOHANN- \n149 EXT. GREEN FIELD - DAY 149 \nLiz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by eons of wind. Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar, weird tree. \nABE This should be the portal. By all rights- Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully. \nJOHANN Abe, bring the mapcase over here. He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a perfect fit. \nLIZ Yes! Try it, Abe- \nHELLBOY 2 95 \nJOHANN Before you do anything... remember what we're in for. A world unlike anything we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive... \nLIZ You're wasting time! Abe inserts and twists the cylinder. The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground, bending them into a swaying arch. \nJOHANN Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to leave. They walk under the tree roots, into... \n150 FAIRY WORLD A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours. The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a rugged coastline. \nCUT TO: \n151 EXT. INLET - DAY 151 \nThe team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe brings out the map. \nABE (pointing to the opposite shore) Renvyle is over there. They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat. Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air. A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group. \nGOBLIN I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you be seeking safe passage to Renvyle? \nBELLBOY 2 96 \nLIZ Yes! Can you help us? \nJOHANN \n(QUIET) Careful, Liz. \nSATYR I'm sure you can come to an understanding! The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns. \nGOBLIN Room enough for all of you! (looks at Hellboy) Even your weary friend. \nJOHANN What will it cost, boatman? The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of triangular teeth. \nGOBLIN Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer. Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves: \nLIZ How much? \nCROW He won't want money. \nJOHANN (to the goblin) I have a... belt! \nOF Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front the creature's bat-like face. \nGOBLIN I have no use for such a thing. Liz shows him her binoculars. \nLIZ Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic eyes that will bring the world- \nHELLBOY 2 97 \nGOBLIN I already have binoculars! No, I see something special. He points toward Hellboy's chest. \nLIZ We're never going to make them all happy, Red. What we have is ours and no one \nELSE'S- \nBELLBOY I can turn my back on the world. I don't care anymore I don't- as long as you stay with me- as long as you think I'm still a good man. \n(BEAT ) Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I?? \nLIZ Yes you are. You are the best man I've ever met. \nHELLBOY You still seem sad. Is there anything you want to tell me-?? \nLIZ Yes, there is- \nHELLBOY Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm ready. \n(SIGHS) Is it about Johann- \nLIZ No- no- what are you talking about?? Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice and fresh rags. \nBELLBOY 2 101 \nJOHANN Abe and I have found the entrance to the Golden Army's resting place- Liz come with us- (looks at Hellboy) You should stay behind and get some rest- \nHELLBOY And call you in the morning, right?? Like Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you, \nGLASSHOLE- \nCUT TO: \n155 EXT. HILLS - DAY \nJohann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there, \nWAVING- \nJOHANN There. Abe points at the violent sea below- \nABE The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to jump in- (looks at Hellboy) Can you make it-? Hellboy nods. \nBELLBOY Strange. If this is the entrance- \nABE I know- Why isn't there more security?? With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around Bellboy's neck! The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles around Hellboy's neck. The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects twice with Hellboy's head. But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in two and twirling the mace like a boleador. \nHELLBOY 2 102 He hits Wink again and again- \nHELLBOY See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!! Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then, like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged rocks once- twice- thrice- \nHELLBOY Ouch- ouch- ouch- (looking around) We better go swimming before any more ugly fellas show up- He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has re-opened. \nABE Red, are you-? \nHELLBOY Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on- \n156 UNDERWATER Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the water, too. Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the cave entrance. \n157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157 \nAs they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz starts coughing. \nJOHANN Hang on, people. I'll be right back. \n158 UNDERWATER Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but can't make it budge. \nBELLBOY 2 103 Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally manages to turn it. His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up, emitting a plume of blood. Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays behind and swings open the lock, revealing... \n", "test1_input": "(OVERLAPPING) -Germans make me nervous- \nMANNING I guess they need a nice open face- A face people can trust. Finally, next to steel cage, they meet- JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his head... \nMANNING . Oh, my God- \nHELLBOY 2 28 .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas! He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the Fairy Cages. Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows. \nJOHANN Johann Kraus, at your service. His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing. Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns toward them. \nHELLBOY (whispers to manning) That's an open face for you... \n48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48 \nJohann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy and the others gather around him. \nJOHANN Poor things, bought and sold on the black market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages. Let's see what they can remember- \nHELLBOY Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die- (nudges Abe) -but maybe I can be of help- Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet. \nJOHANN Oh, no, no- No amulets are required. He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock. \nHELLBOY What are you doing? \nJOHANN I can inhabit inanimate things: organic, \nMECHANICAL- \nHELLBOY \nINHABIT- \nHELLBOY 2 29 \nABE \nTELEPLASTY- \nJOHANN Exactly. A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips, slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the- -\"Dead\" Fairy. \nJOHANN I can briefly take control of entities, both mechanical and organic and reactivate their neural system- The \"dead\" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two more do the same from another pen. \nJOHANN (CONT'D) (points at Hellboy) You scare him- The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB. \nHELLBOY (leering at it) Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of my tail- Yes, you- \nJOHANN (CONT'D) Rough translation: He says you are rude, brutish and not too bright- \nABE Touche. More high-pitched jabbering... Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen. \nJOHANN (CONT'D) Enough. it seems our little friend here remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise in the last place where his cage was traded: market sounds- \n(BEAT) Troll language- \nLIZ The troll market- ? \nHELLBOY 2 30 \nJOHANN Exactly, Miss Sherman. The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and weak. \nHELLBOY Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too good. \nJOHANN I'm losing my grip on its limbic system- He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about to die- \nHELLBOY Wow- You have that effect on me too. The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses. Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's fingertips. \n", "test1_true": "JOHANN Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges- And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist- places it under Washington Bridge \nABE We've looked there before-- Staked it out for weeks- \nJOHANN Yes, but this time I have asked for a very special piece of equipment- He moves in to a large crate marked \"Lot 336\" \nABE \"336\" The schufftein glasses?? \nJOHANN (smiles knowingly) On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we have this clue- He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL. \nHELLBOY 2 31 \nJOHANN In my mind we have enough to go by- Any questions?? Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises his hand- \nJOHANN Yes- what is it? \nHELLBOY If you're really German- how come you don't have a funny accent? \nJOHANN \n(SIGHS) Get ready. We are on the move. \n49 INT. GARAGE AREA / DRESSING LOCKER ROOMS \nHellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same. \nHELLBOY What a moron!! \"We are on the move\" He thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking for that place for years and we've never found it- (looks at Abe) You said so- Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He tries it on. \nLIZ Get used to it. He might be here for good- \nHELLBOY For good?! \nLIZ He has a nice voice. \nABE Yes, very commanding, very soothing. \nHELLBOY I think he's a jerk. \nABE I like him. \nHELLBOY 2 32 \nHELLBOY Well, then you're a jerk, too. \"The brains of the operation-\" give me a break! \nJOHANN They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and are waiting there. \nLIZ I think you feel threatened... Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard. \nCUT TO: \n50 EXT. WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT 50 \nThe Garbage truck and a few other BPRD vehicles crossthe Washington Bridge on the way to CHINATOWN. \nSIGN: WASHINGTON BRIDGE 21.00 HOURS \n51 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT 51 \nHellboy rides in silence- still thinking hard- then. \nHELLBOY Ha! Me? Threatened?? Glaring, at Liz: \nHELLBOY By whom? By him?? \n", "test1_id": 1479, "test2_input": "MANNING Oh, dear Lord. \n(PAUSE) What about the cats? \nLIZ She eats them. \nMANNING \"She??\" That's a \"she\"????? \nHELLBOY We're moving in, Sparky- \n61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61 HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service \nDOOR- \n/ SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62 \n62 INT. BOWLING ALLEY \nThe bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of rolling balls and toppling pins. \nHELLBOY \n(WHISPERS) Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh? \nABE (splays his webbed fingers) Bowling balls- they give me trouble. \nHELLBOY How about a beer, then? Now that we're \"out\"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr? \nHELLBOY 2 39 \nJOHANN Sorry. I don't drink. \nHELLBOY \nSHEESH- \n63 INT. BOWLING ALLEY BASEMENT 63 \nHellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old woman. Just a Warehouse- \nJOHANN' Adjust the prisms to \"2\" Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own- unsuccessfully. Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree trunks and stone columns are visible... \nABE \nTHERE- Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical lock. \nHELLBOY What the heck is that? \nABE A locking mechanism- \nHELLBOY Mmh- I'll take care of it- He clenches his stone fist, rears back... \nJOHANN No- You destroy it. We'll never get in- He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock. \nHELLBOY Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch- \nJOHANN Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the- \nHELLBOY 2 4 0 \n64 MECHANISM OF THE LOCK -filling it, making a few complex gears turn and move- \n65 THE LOCK Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase. Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off the valves. \nJOHANN Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market. \n", "test2_true": "Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of narrow alleys and foetid vapour. Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking through garbage, scattering vermin. Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy puddles. Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and century. At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive) cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men, Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology. A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another while violent bettors laugh and shout. At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse of her slippered feet... .which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His curiosity aroused, he follows her. \n67 MARKET STALL The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face. It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her beauty is transcendent. \nHELLBOY 2 41 Abe is thunderstruck. As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of arms! \nABE (into microphone) Brother Red!! \nHELLBOY \n(INTERCOM) Not now, Abe. As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after her. \n68 EXT. SHOP - SAME \nHellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a surly SHOP OWNER. \nSHOP OWNER Never seen anything like it. No one sells `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe. Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his feet encased in iron shoes. Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back- \nHELLBOY Hiya, Chuck- \n- SAME 69 \n69 EXT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES \nAbe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another one, narrow and dark. Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats them away. \n70 EXT. SHOP - SAME \nNow Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop owner. \nJOHANN What about this?? Do you recognize this seal? \nHELLBOY 2 42 The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale. \nSHOP OWNER You'd better go. Now. \nJOHANN Please. We'll make it worth your while. The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!! \nSHOP OWNER (CONT'D) He's not friendly- Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature. \nHELLBOY Well, neither am I- BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the dogfight. The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing with blind instinct. Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a boxer's speed bag as HB \"gently\" slaps him around. Teeth fly everywhere. \nHELLBOY Feeling more chatty now?? \nSHOP OWNER It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me, all right? There's talk of a revolt- a revolt against the human world- Hellboy releases him, then looks around. \nHELLBOY Where the hell is Abe?? He pushes his belt locator- \nHELLBOY 2 43 1.,,,d 71 INT. TROLL MARKET ALLEY MAZE - NIGHT 71 The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a safety holding case. The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and hands it to her. A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt. \nHELLBOY \n(INTERCOM) Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty- \nABE I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your locator -. A large TROLL cuts him off- \nABE Excuse me- What do you think you're doing? \nHELLBOY \n(INTERCOM) Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe. Another TROLL comes up behind Abe. \nABE (CONT'D) I don't think you- The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG. \n", "test2_id": 1480, "test3_input": "ABE \n(APPROACHING) Here... For her... Take it... \nJOHANN Oh, my God. What has he done? Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece to the Prince. Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed. \nHELLBOY Abe - \nABE (to Hellboy) You cannot fight him- not without hurting her... \n(BEAT ) What would you do if it was Liz?? CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places the resulting crown on his head! \nPRINCE I am Prince Nuada and I command my army to life once more. Does anyone dispute my right? With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields. \nPRINCE (CONT'D) (points at the team) Kill them. Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back. \nABE (to the Prince) That was your price!! A ransom, you said - paid in good faith!! \n(MORE) \nHELLBOY 2 107 ABE(continued) (to Hellboy) Why, he lied to us! \nHELLBOY Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we need to talk. The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls. \nABE He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a highborn heir to the throne, last in a noble line of- \nBELLBOY Not now, Abe, okay? The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and swings it like a club. A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms. \nLIZ Let me - Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the oncoming fighters. The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming, marching on and over their scorched comrades. Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it his best. His wound is running with fresh blood. He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect. At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on. \nJOHANN Invincibility!? So - the only one thing may stop them - Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier! \nHELLBOY 2 108 Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as Johann rips into the enemy!! But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically dismember it like marauding insects! As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless, Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit. \nJOHANN Ach. They are too many. Anyone have another idea? Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his feet. \nHELLBOY (a bellow) Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to command this army! With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a ledge with his sister. \nABE (follows HB) No= please- no- Hellboy moves away from him. \nHELLBOY A challenge must be answered! Raise your sword! \nPRINCE A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are no one. \nPRINCESS No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the Fallen one- He has the right! Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way. The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks up his sword. \nHELLBOY 2 10 9 \nPRINCE Very well. (to the BPRD team) May his fate show you the cost of pride and blindness. As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords- \nJOHANN Hellboy's too weak- Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army. Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep parrying off his enemy. Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond. The Prince is ready to kill him. \nLIZ (witness to a nightmare) No!! NO! ! A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps forward and... Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger. Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away red with blood. He looks over at his sister. They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and hatred. Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has the advantage. He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest. \nHELLBOY I- have- won- \nPRINCE No. You have not- \nHELLBOY 2 110 He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded. \nABE \n(GASPS) \nNO- Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms, blinking in despair. The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face. \n", "test3_true": "PRINCE (to Hellboy) You... think you're any different from me? The humans - they will tire of you. They will disappoint you. And in the end, they will betray you. You... are living a lie. Your time will come again. May you make a better choice. Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from Abe's hands... Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head. Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities. Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first segement... . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a heap of scrap metal! Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and another massive division of the army tumbles into junk! HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when it explodes in his hands! WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates. Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards: \nHELLBOY 2 111 \nHELLBOY (to the trolls) You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay in the shadows - where you belong. As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words. \nDISSOLVE: \n163 EXT. HILLS - DAY \nThe BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through the magical hills. Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance. \n164 EXT. TREE -- DAY \nThey reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map cylinder and fits it into the slot. \nJOHANN Any last minute requests? \nABE (very quiet) Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real world now. Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch... and the BPRD team walks through. \n165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAY \nOn the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the countryside, looking for them. Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere. \nMANNING \n(STARTLED) Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just- \nBELLBOY I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate that Manning. \nHELLBOY 2 112 Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment pack. \nABE Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you, too. For all you've done for us over the years. He gives his stuff to the astonished agent. \nMANNING What? What, exactly is this? \nABE (walking away) I quit. Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and shrugs off his pack, too. \nMANNING Come on. You're resigning? \nHELLBOY Looks that way, doesn't it? Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun back. \nHELLBOY (CONT'D) I think I'll keep this. He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging tightly to the big, red daemon. \nMANNING Liz -- not you, too!? (to Johann) They can't do this. Stop them, Johann- \nJOHANN Manning, you're an asshole. \n166 EXT. COASTLINE - DAY 166 \nMiles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections. Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks. Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds. \nBELLBOY 2 113 \nLIZ What you said before - about us living \nANYWHERE- \nHELLBOY I mean it! `Course, I'm thinking USA... but, hey - you decide. \nLIZ (breathing deep) Let's find a place in the country. Clean air - green hills - fresh milk from the farm. \nHELLBOY Milk? Yech. \n", "test3_id": 1481}

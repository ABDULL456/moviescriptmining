A massive explosion- \n29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29 Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window. A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting, writhing fairies. Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands in their midst, cracking the pavement. \n30 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME \nLiz and Abe go to the window and look down. A TV CAMERA LENS \nZOOMS IN ON THEM BOTH. \nHELLBOY 2 17 \nLIZ (into her radio) HB?? HB?? Are you alright?? \n31 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 31 \nThe crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd. People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters jumps at a woman but- BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and efficiently shoots its fellows. Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds it up by the tail, like a rodent. Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy. \nHELLBOY (looks at Manning) Gee whiz, Manning- \n(SHRUGS) I guess we're out now. \nCUT TO: \n32 CREDITS 32 Behind the CREDITS are caballistic engravings suggesting the power, size and weapons of a mystic, mechanical GOLDEN ARMY. \nCUT TO: \n33 EXT.

HB is on the screen, surrounded by press and TV. \nGUARD 1 Check it out. That guy's make-up is so fake. I mean, come on, solid red- Guard 2 is cleaning his gun. \nGUARD 2 And what's with his forehead? Is that goggles? He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE standing by the gates. \nGUARD 2 (CONT'D) Hey, we got us a wino. He grabs his nightstick and steps outside. \n35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT \nWaving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder. Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall. \nGUARD 2 Hey- buddy- get the- The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the guard. The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts and collapses. \n36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT \nGuard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside- -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!! \nBAMMKM ! ! ! ! THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard. WINK emerges from behind the shack. \nHELLBOY 2 19 Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and follows him through. \n37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37 \n", "test1_true": "CHAMBERLAIN Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please, follow me, Sire. \n38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38 \nThe Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an intersection. The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls. \nCHAMBERLAIN I beg you, your majesty. Before entering the chamber you surrender your sword. \nPRINCE I will not. \nCHAMBERLAIN Then, I regret to say, you may not see your father. It is the protocol, sire. For peasant and prince alike. Please- for the last time- surrender your sword. A tense beat and then the Prince relents. The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down- \nPRINCE Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his weapon. He will wait here- WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a huge, rusting iron door. \nHELLBOY 2 20 \n39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39 \nAn abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber. High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there: goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves. At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the Prince's sister. Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece dangles from a chain. Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and YANG, almost the same being. The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed guards watch his every move. He bows his head and kneels. \nPRINCE Father. (eyes the Princess) \nSISTER- The KING gestures for him to rise. \nKING Why have you done this?? His voice trembles with anger. \nKING (CONT'D) Why? ! The Prince looks at him, defiant. \nPRINCE I have returned from exile to set us free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim what has been taken from our people. The land and the freedom that is rightfully ours. \nKING No- You have broken a truce that has lasted for centuries. \nHELLBOY 2 21 \nPRINCE A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can you abide it? How- ? They have no respect for themselves, their Gods or the earth- \n(BEAT) And they scorn us- every time they raise a dead, cold building, destroy a forest, or take more land- The PRINCESS then steps forward. \nPRINCESS What they do is in their nature. We must honor our side of the agreement- \nPRINCE Honor-? \n(BEAT) Look at this place. Is this where you hold court?? \n(BEAT ) Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their filth, in their rubble??? Picking at scraps from their table??? Where is the honor in that?? \nKING And what would your solution be-? War? Why? \n(PAUSE) It may just be that our days are ended... \nPRINCE It may be- but we will not go quiet. We will not fade like this. Better to burn than fade away... And for this... Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of the clans. \nPRINCE .we'll need the help of the Good... the Bad... and the Worst- He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it high. The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion. \nKING No- you cannot be that mad- \nHELLBOY 2 22 \nPRINCE Yes. I am. \nKING This is the path you wish to take? Knowing the cost? \nPRINCE Yes, Father- it is. The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his head. \n", "test1_id": 1479, "test2_input": "ABE (CONT'D) Oh, my- The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet - into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He groans. \nHELLBOY Abe? What's wrong? \nHELLBOY 2 44 Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the cobblestones. \nHELLBOY \n(INTERCOM) Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit - \n72 EXT. SHOP - SAME 72 \nThe locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann look at each other. Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the crowd. \n73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73 \nAbe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt- It's not there. \nPRINCESS If you are looking for your weapons, my guards took them. Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in fine silk robes. She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large, featherless REPTILE/BIRDS. \nABE I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure you... \nPRINCESS Why were you following me? Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly beguiled by her. \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) Are you seeking to join my brother? \nABE Your brother-?? \nHELLBOY 2 45 \nPRINCESS In his revolt against the humans? \nABE A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely mistaken... He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere, barking and growling. \nPRINCESS Then answer me truthfully- Why were you following me? \nABE My name is Abe Sapien - \nPRINCESS \n(LAUGHING) There is no such name! \nABE Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. If we can assist you- \nPRINCESS Give me your hand. Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his palm. The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for the YRDRIG to yield. \nPRINCESS Down Yrdrig - he's a friend. The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all three tongues. \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) Yrdrig's really just a puppy. The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw. \nABE \n(WHEEZING) Nice puppy... \nA The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him playful shake. \nHELLBOY 2 46 \nPRINCESS My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave our guest alone- The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor. \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig! As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up- \nPRINCESS (CONT'D) (bows her head) My name is Princess Nuala. \nABE (bows his head) Your highness, the honor is all mine. \n", "test2_true": "ABE Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy, \nTOO- \nPRINCESS And under diplomatic immunity - may I seek asylum?? \nABE We would be... honored, I'm sure. But, may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum? Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile fallen guards outside. \nABE Red, no! I'm all right! The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm. \nABE Gentlemen! Some respect, please! The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards. The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like mosquitoes. \nHELLBOY 2 47 \nPRINCESS And that was my royal guard. \nABE Red, apologize at once! We are in the presence of... royalty! Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a schoolboy. \nJOHANN (to Abe) You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr Sapien? \nABE Oh, most definitely. She's from an ancient, noble line - \nJOHANN - of warriors. The Children of the Earth. (to the Princess) I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a fierce bloodline, we cannot take your claim of allegiance at face value. He produces the ANCIENT SEAL. \n74 INT. MAPMAKERS VESTIBULE - LATER 74 \nStanding at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle and examines the ancient seal. \nPRINCESS Where did you get this? \nHELLBOY Human side, two nights ago- The Princess studies their faces. \nPRINCESS In ancient times a seal like this was delivered to the enemy as a declaration of war. A signal from the underground realm to the entire world. It prefaced the awakening of the Golden Army- Johann sits down heavily. \nJOHANN I feared as much. \nHELLBOY 2 48 \nHELLBOY (to Johann) What-? What-? A goblin army-? Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry. \nJOHANN Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There has been nothing to substantiate such a \nTALE- \nPRINCESS Not a tale- At the dawn of time... Even before the great flood, man and the Children of the Earth shared this planet... (she sighs) But as man in his greed expanded his dominion, there ensued a bitter war... \nDISSOLVE: \n75 EXT. MYTHICAL BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 75 \nSilhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with hordes of men. \nPRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) In those days, my people were led by my Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of Elfland. KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA. \nPRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D) The bloodshed went on year after year. Many lives were lost. An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below the horizon. \n76 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 76 \nSeated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a wretched guild of deformed goblins. \nHELLBOY 2 49 \nPRINCESS (V.0.) It was then that the King ordered the Sigri to build him a new, invincible army. \n", "test2_id": 1480, "test3_input": "PRINCE (to the Elemental) Over here, dear friend... SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages. \nHELLBOY 2 62 The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel spire, his coat flapping in the night wind. \nPRINCE This might be a good chance for you to come to your senses. Help us. \nHELLBOY I've been all through this! The answer's still no! Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable, bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a steel snake! The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable \nTENSES- \nJOHANN (to Liz) Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet. Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he tosses Hellboy high into the air. On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the Elemental's back, right behind his head. \nHELLBOY Nap time, Big guy- He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back of the neck. The cable tenses- -The Elemental pitches forward- The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at him; his mouth opens as if to scream... The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing. Putting an end, it seems, to both of them. \nHELLBOY 2 63 The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change. Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges, bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly, laughing and happy to be together. Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at him... Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance, jealous, alone. \nCUT TO: \n99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99 \nBLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a button, brings the paper close for inspection. Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye. Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke. \nJOHANN You'll permit a small criticism? You take too much time to aim, to think. Nein. Just point- like afinger- as if you wish for something. \nHELLBOY Oh, I wish for something. Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster of shots, dead center. \nJOHANN Speed is of the essence. You must work on it. I'm willing to spend some - Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's onto the floor. \nHELLBOY Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I don't like it. \nHELLBOY 2 64 \nJOHANN On the contrary. \n100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100 \nHellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a terry cloth towel. \nHELLBOY You keep wiping that thing like she's gonna care. \nJOHANN She- Who-?? \nHELLBOY You know who- She- \n(BEAT) She's not gonna care. \nJOHANN (long beat) You think I'm after Liz, don't you? (Hellboy walks out) Well, I'm not. \nHELLBOY Why not? \n(BEAT) Not good enough for you? Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind Johann. \nHELLBOY Well- From now on, you don't come near her. You don't talk to her- \nJOHANN You forget. I'm part of the team now, such interactions are inev- \nHELLBOY Well- you better start making them \"evitable\"- \nJOHANN That's not a word- \nHELLBOY Yes, it is- \nHELLBOY 2 65 \nJOHANN No, it isn't- Hellboy raises his stone fist. \n", "test3_true": "JOHANN Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's how you win an argument. \nHELLBOY I try. \nJOHANN Well, you're big, I'll give you that much- \nHELLBOY \"Give me???\"- You don't give me sh- \nJOHANN -and you're strong- but you're slow. \nHELLBOY Slo-?? \nJOHANN Very- slow- I've seen your fighting style. Very slow- WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium shatters! \nHELLBOY Slow enough for ya-?? With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor! \nHELLBOY Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got carried away... (leaning over the empty suit) Johann? You still hear me? An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and penetrates the closest locker. \nHELLBOY It was an accident, okay? I'll get you some help- \nHELLBOY 2 66 With a CLANG! -- the bank of lockers comes to life! Metal doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball machine! his face imprinted in the metal. \nJOHANN See? Speed is the key. The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he goes by. Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits. \nHELLBOY Chicken shit! \nCUT TO: \n- NIGHT 101 \n101 INT. THE LIBRARY \nAbe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at one of the book stands, reading to him. \nPRINCESS \"I sometimes have a queer feeling - especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.\" \nABE I love this part. Keep going. \nPRINCESS \"I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.\" She closes the book, looking troubled. \nABE Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I was born. It would have been a great privilege to have known her... \nPRINCESS This \"Jane Eyre\"... I understand it's only a story, but such a tie that binds, it exists between me and my brother. I assure you: my brother, he's not dead- \nHELLBOY 2 67 \nABE How can you know? We all saw- \nPRINCESS We are twins. Even now, I can sense his presence. This has been our way since we were young children, in Renvyle- \nABE Renvyle, Ireland- The ancient isles- \nPRINCESS \n(NODS) A magical place in the West. A different time. Long gone. Now, he's near and he's looking for me. I can feel and even understand his. hatred for mankind. \nABE Men... usually mean well, I believe that. But they need our help and patience. \nPRINCESS You were very brave, vouching for me. How do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing me here? \nABE It's as you were saying, I suppose. From intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone like you... but that's my instinct.

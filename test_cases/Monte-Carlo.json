{"train": "MONTE CARLO \nWritten by \nRon Bass \nBased on the novel \n\"HEADHUNTERS\" \nby Jules Bass \nTHIRD DRAFT November 4, 2007 \nOVER BLACK: \nALICE (V.0.) Think of the future, and events that will have already happened. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color, chalks \"Futur Anterieur\" in precise cursive at the board. \nALICE \"By tomorrow, we will have flown to France.\" She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS. Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior. \nALICE (CONT'D) Who can give me an example? Paul? NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be \nread as in FRENCH with ENGLISH subtitles. \nPAUL \"I will have completed the assigned translation by the end of vacation.\" \nALICE C'est bon! Amber? \nAMBER I will have failed French again by the end of the year. Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy. \nALICE En francais si'l vows plait? \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nEMMA So, the definition of the derivative of the function \"f\" at point \"x\" is..? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 2. \nCONTINUED: EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex calculus formula at the board while all of her TWELFTH GRADE MALE STUDENTS avidly admire her shape in a tight, stylish skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly. \nEMMA (CONT'D) Okay! Kyle? KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover. \nKYLE Um... I guess I'm a little lost. If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a level of wilfulness is required. \nEMMA Try to follow along. I really want you guys to get this! David? DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog. \nEMMA (CONT'D) Cindy? \nIS \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - HOME ARTS LAB - DAY \nTWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast. The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room. Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup, Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference. She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls leap back with a shriek, shakes her head. The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly snuffing the flames. They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke. \nMEG Do me a favor, and let's just try to get to vacation. The class bell RINGS! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 3. \nCONTINUED: \nMEG (CONT'D) You can burn the school down as soon as we're back. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nAlice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats, exit the school among a crush of students. Together, they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow, to the parking lot, stopping at Alice's weathered Volvo where Richard hands over the binders with a kiss. \nRICHARD Got practice until five thirty, then I'll be by. \nALICE I'll see you then. Thanks. They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves. \nRICHARD Hey, Meg! Bon voyage! Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car. \nALICE I finished our travel binders! Meg takes the binder, looks it over. \nMEG Remind me again why we're taking phonebooks to France? Alice gives her a look. \nMEG (CONT'D) I love my binder. I do. \nALICE Where's Emma? She knows we're meeting, right? \nMEG Forgot her purse. (watching the students) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 4. \nCONTINUED: \nFINN Can we get on the radio? \nMEG GLENN No. No. Meg watches her kids run to the squad car parked at the curb, just as KARYN (30's, also in uniform) emerges on the passenger side to meet them. \nGLENN And no lights! \nKARYN Hey, Meg! Meg lifts her chin in greeting, but that's it. \nGLENN I uh... I heard from my lawyer. She said you'd signed your papers. Meg watches her kids climb in the car with Karyn. \nGLENN (CONT'D) Guess that makes us official, then. \nMEG You and me? (a nod to the car) Or... \nGLENN You and me, Meg. A beat as they look at one another, hold. \nSEAMUS Mom! Seamus reappears, charging up the walk to pull Meg down to his level, hugging her. \nSEAMUS (CONT'D) Have fun. \nINT. EMMA'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEmma's packed suitcases stand neatly arranged by the door of the sparsely furnished, undecorated room. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 S. \nCONTINUED: \nANSWERING MACHINE You have no messages. Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the record button on her answering machine, then speaks with a put-on, coolly sophisticated,'jet-setting accent. \nEMMA Hello. You've reached the home of Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't be able to return your call right away, as I'm currently traveling. In Europe. But, please, do leave a message. \nTV ANNOUNCER \". .She was known as 'The People's Princess'... Emma turns at the counter to see Princes Diana touring an African encampment with children on the television. \nEMMA Ooh! She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved Lean Cuisine dinner. She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the cards, shuffling. Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp. \nEXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAlice opens the door, kissing Richard who holds up a suitcase in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other. \nRICHARD Special delivery. \nINT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory as Richard pours the Champagne into two glasses. \nALICE That's it! I am good to go! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 9. \nCONTINUED: Richard brings a glass to Alice, nuzzles her ear. \nRICHARD I'm proud of you, you know. Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed, climbing on top of him. \nALICE Like Christmas when I was a kid. There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight-- \nRICHARD Good for me. They kiss. \nALICE I mean, how long have I been talking about this? \nRICHARD Mmm... You were reading Colette. In the teacher's lounge. First time we met. Long time. Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) This is just the beginning. \nALICE \n(BRIGHTENING) It feels like it. They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass back then stop mid-sip to peer down at the delicate diamond ring sitting at the bottom of her glass. \nALICE (CONT'D) \n(STUNNED) Oh. Richard... It's so... It's beautiful... Richard takes her glass and fishes out the ring. \nRICHARD Let's try it on. \nALICE But, we can't even celebrate-- \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 10. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRICHARD What are you talking about? We're \nCELEBRATING-- \nALICE But, I'm leaving. I'm--. I'm getting on a plane in the morning. \nRICHARD \n(LAUGHS) Maybe I want to make sure you come \nBACK-- (stops, sobers) Wait. You're serious. Are you serious? You're serious. \nEMMA Hey, Alice! Meg! Alice and Meg turn to Emma across the aisle, who hooks a thumb at CARL and DEEDEE (late 60's, both stout) beside her. \nEMMA (CONT'D) Can you believe? They're from St. Paul! On their honeymoon! \nCARL Waited a long time for this! But, we finally made it! \nEMMA Alice, that's like you! (back to couple) We're here celebrating my friend Meg's divorce! \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 14. \nEXT. THE LOUVRE - DAY \nThe bus hurtles around the drive, screeching to a halt, bouncing roughly on its shocks at the museum's entrance. \nINT. LOUVRE - DAY \nAlice, Meg and Emma race past gallery after gallery, trying to keep Madame Valery's little blue flag in sight as it flies over the crowd in the distance. Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making notes in her guidebook on the fly. \nALICE Try to remember that! We'll double back for the Chagalls! \nINT. LOUVRE - DAY \nMadame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory. Alice stops Meg and Emma in front of the statue, while Carl and Deedee try to catch their breath on the landing. \nALICE \n(READING FAST) .Also called Nike of Samothrace. Greek goddess Nike, meaning victory. Two-twenty to one-ninety B. C. Okay, go! They head for the right stairs just as Madam Valery reappears, descending with her group on the left. \nALICE (CONT'D) Oh. Alice turns Meg and Emma around to come back down. \nDEEDEE Well, that saved us a climb. \nINT. LOUVRE - DAY \nEmma elbows her way out of a crush of raised cameras and cellphones to Alice and Meg who strain at the rear of the CROWD to view a painting, all but the top of its gold frame obscured. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 15. \nCONTINUED: \nEMMA (waving her camera) I got it! I got it! \nINT. BISTRO - NIGHT \nMeg and Emma sit hunched over Emma's camera and its shaky, digital image of the Mona Lisa, squeezed in with Alice and the rest of their tour at too few tables. \nEMMA Alice, I'll e-mail it to you. Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings. \nMEG (re: Mona Lisa) At least she's smiling. \nALICE (snaps to, smiling) What? No. I'm--. I'm just a little tired. \nEMMA (a happy idea) \nHey! I'll bet you have jet lag! We'll probably all get it! Meg raises a glass of wine. \nMEG To jet lag. Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk down identical plates of steak frites before them. \nMEG (CONT'D) To Alice. Best organizer. Best guide. Best friend. \nEMMA To Alice! They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind her, spilling her wine. \nDEEDEE Oh, Carl! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 16. \nCONTINUED: \nCARL I am so sorry! \nALICE (mopping her front) \nIT'S OKAY-- \nDEEDEE He was just looking for the catsup- \nCARL If you're not using it. As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them with creme brulees. \nALICE Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur-- \nCARL \n(RECEIVING CATSUP) Merci! He turns now, catsup in hand, to blink at the creme brulee that has replaced his own and Deedee's steaks. \nAlice places a hand on Madam Valery's arm as she passes. \nALICE Pardon, Madame, but... Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand. \nALICE (CONT'D) I'm sorry, but-- \nMEG Are you apologizing? \nALICE They've taken our dinners away-- Madame Valery taps her watch and then her clipboard. \nALICE But, we haven't been-- \nMADAME VALERY Which is why you must follow my flag! \nALICE okay. We will. I promise. But, these people haven't seen the \nCATHEDRAL--- \nMADAME VALERY There are many churches on the tour. \nALICE But, this is Notre Dame! They need to see this-- \nMADAME VALERY I assure you, they will see everything they need to see-- \nALICE \n(LOSING IT) Well, what's the point if it's all a big fat blur? When nobody can see anything properly? Let alone experience it, or appreciate-- \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 21. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMADAME VALERY You seem quite the Paris expert, for someone who has never been. \nEMMA Ill bet she knows more about it than you! The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera. \nALICE I might not have ever been here before, but... \n(EMOTIONAL) I've waited my whole life for this trip. \nCARL We've waited thirty years-- \nMEG You tell her, Carl. \nALICE You keep rushing us through, like this is some kind of race-- \n(REALLY HURT) And you won't even speak French with me. \n(SGUARES HERSELF) Now, I think I've been very nice. We're from Wisconsin. But, I'm telling you, I am not getting on that bus until my friends and I have seen Notre Dame. Meg and Emma exchange looks as Alice plants herself with folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery. \nMADAME VALERY Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied with my tour she could conduct her own. \nEMMA What'd she say? Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks. CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff, the sound of the shutter triggering Alice to action. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 22. \nCONTINUED: (3) With lightning speed, she seizes Madame Valery's flag. \nCROWD Whoa! Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag, but Alice jerks it further away, while the Japanese woman snaps picture after picture. \nDEEDEE Carl, we're getting on the bus! Madame Valery lunges for the stick. \nEXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY \nThe bus pulls away, revealing the Japanese couple who return Emma's camera with a bow, Meg, and Alice holding the flag. \nEMMA That was fantastic! \nMEG \"A\" plus! Alice, cheeks flushed, watches Carl waving goodbye from the \nbus's rear window. \nMEG (CONT'D) Alice, you okay? Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in two, casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises herself to her full height. \nALICE Now, the real tour can begin! \nMEG Let's kick this town's ass! Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall. \nEMMA I think it's starting to rain-- \nALICE Who cares? We're in Paris! What's a little rain? \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 23. \nEXT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - NIGHT \nWater pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of the hotel's canopy. They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their sopping clothes. \nPHOTOGRAPHER 1 Cordelia! They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera flashes in taking Emma's picture. Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer admonishes the first. \nPHOTOGRAPHER 2 You're wasting your film. That's not her. \nEMMA What're they saying? \nAlice looks about in equal confusion, but stops short when she sees the opulent restaurant behind the window's glass. \nALICE Oh. Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant tables inside as the rain hammers down. \nALICE (CONT'D) That, mes aims, is Paris. \nEMMA You think they'd let me use the bathroom? \nINT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT \n(PERFECT MIMIC) Darling, I was thinking of ordering this entire menu, and then not eating it! \nThe waiter retreats, joining FIVE others standing at discreet, fearful attention, all careful not to look at Emma whom they've clearly mistaken her for Cordelia. \nMEG We should just take it. Her room. \nEMMA And her trip to Monte Carlo! \n(TO ALICE) That's still France, right? \nMEG Alice, how fast can you get a binder going on a trip like that? \nALICE \n(LAUGHS) Oh, I'd love to see that. Us in Monte Carlo. \nMEG What's so funny about that? We got in here. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 28. \nCONTINUED: \nEMMA \n(MIMICKING) Indeed. It is pitiful how low the standards here have fallen. Two waiters step in to clear plates, hearing all. \nEMMA (CONT'D) \n(MIMICKING) Remind me to have Daddy buy this hotel so that I can knock it down. Alice and Meg laugh with Emma as the waiters head for the kitchen in panic. \nWAITER (whispers to other) She is a monster! \nMEG Emma, you could be her! \nEMMA \n(MIMICKING) Darling, Meg. Always making me laugh! \n(DROPPING IT) Who in their right mind would ever believe that I was-- \nMANAGER Pardon, Mademoiselle Scott? The three look up at the manager in surprise. \nALICE I'm so sorry. Were we being too loud? \nMANAGER No, no, we are all very happy to see Mademoiselle Scott smile... A WINE STEWARD hustles up to the table with an ice bucket stand and a bottle of Champagne. \nMANAGER (CONT'D) Please. In apology for our earlier misunderstanding. \nEMMA Our misunder--? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 29. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMANAGER Your dinners as well. With our compliments... The three women exchange glances as the steward begins to open the bottle and the manager bows, backing away. \nEMMA Excuse me, Monsieur? \nMANAGER Oui, Mademoiselle? Emma smiles, broadly, batting her eyelashes as the steward pops the Champagne cork. \nEMMA \n(PERFECT BRITISH) I so hate to be a bother, but I seem to have misplaced my room key. \nINT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT \nCLICK! The door swings open into the dark room, framing the three drunk laughing women. \nAlice fumbles for a switch, hitting the lights, and their laughter cuts abruptly at the sumptuous interior of gleaming marble, gilt and silk. \nME G \nHOLY-- \nEMMA Scheize. Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of French doors. \nALICE A view! There's a view. Alice races to push back the window sheers, revealing a staggering panorama of the city, the Seine, and the Eiffel tower in the pouring rain. The entire city of light is reflected in her eyes. \nEMMA (O.S.) Now this is more like it! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 30. \nCONTINUED: \nMEG There's whole other room in here! \nINT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - SUITE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nAlice enters, steering around a tower of Louis Vuitton luggage, as Meg pulls a fresh bottle of Champagne from a bucket of ice. \nALICE Wait. What are you guys doing? Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed. \nEMMA \n(SNATCHING IT) Thanks again! They break for the door, but the manager follows. \nMANAGER I'm afraid there may still be some \nPHOTOGRAPHERS OUTSIDE-- \nEMMA What? \nEXT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - DAY \nAs they emerge, the manager and doormen hustle Alice, Emma and Meg towards a waiting car and driver, as paparazzi call and shoot from across the boulevard. \nALICE Thank you so much but I think we'll \nWALK-- \nMANAGER \n(LAUGHS) But, you can not walk to the airport. \nALICE \n(STOPS FAST) The airport? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 34. \nCONTINUED: A beat, as Emma and Meg look to Alice for direction and the frenzied calls of the paparazzi increase. \nINT. CAR - MOVING - DAY \nALICE It's fine. It's fine. We'll just have him drop us off... Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who waves them farewell, the doorman shooing photographers. \nMEG They really do think she's her... RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's contents. \nEMMA What? I want to know where we're going. \nALICE We're going back to our hotel-- Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin. \nEMMA No. We're going to Monte Carlo! \nALICE No. We're not. \nMEG \n(TAKING ITINERARY) Let me see that-- \nEMMA Alice, what's \"prive?\" Is that like an airline? \nALICE Emma, for crying out loud. Meg, you want to help me out here? \nMEG Hold on... I'm reading... \nEMMA See? Meg wants to go. Don't you, Meg? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 35. \nCONTINUED: \nALICE No, Meg, doesn't. Meg looks up from the itinerary, shrugs. \nMEG Trip's paid for, whether that girl takes it or not. \nALICE Oh! And somehow that magically makes taking it right? \nEMMA What's the worst that could happen? \nALICE I can think of a lot of things-- \nMEG You're in charge. You want to go back to that hotel, okay by me. A beat while Alice looks between Meg and Emma, trapped. \nMEG (CONT'D) \nTotally your call. \nEMMA \n(FULL-ON CORDELIA) And, darling, we'll completely understand if you feel we shouldn't go. \nEXT. AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY \nThe car drives across the wide stretch of runway on a trajectory for a waiting private jet. \nINT. PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT - DAY \nThe women swivel around in their plush seats at the POP! of a cork as a STEWARD opens a bottle of Champagne. \nALICE Okay. We go. We take a look around. We get on a train and come right back... \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 36. \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 39. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nJEAN-PIERRE \nBUT-- \nALICE We're very sorry-- \nJEAN-PIERRE \n(MOUNTING ANXIETY) Perhaps we have misunderstood each other. Mademoiselle Scott--. She must be there for tonight's game. The prince. His Highness has asked to be seated across from her-- \nEMMA What's he saying? Which prince? Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three. \nJEAN-PIERRE Please. It is for the foundation. \nINT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY \nWithin a glossy brochure: A collage of \"snapshots\" shows happy African children grouped outside their new school; raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom; finding their country on a glossy globe. \nALICE \n(ANGUISHED) Oh, would you look at these kids? \nMEG No, I can't. I can't stand it. Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay. \nEMMA \"With your help The Michand Foundation is able to sow the seeds of education, transforming lives, families, and villages, one child at a time...\" She didn't say anything about a school! \nMEG Schools, with an \"s.\" More than one. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 40 \nCONTINUED: \nALICE \n(MISERABLE) In Africa. \nMEG That horrible, irresponsible girl! I've never stolen a thing in my life, now I've taken a trip from school children. \nALICE In Africa. Meg hangs her head. \nEMMA Reykjavik! That takes some nerve! They're counting on her for a charity auction and she doesn't even show up! \nALICE Only she did. Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket. \nEMMA She did? \nMEG Do not touch that! \nALICE You, Emma. If you're Cordelia. They've seen you. You're here. \nEMMA Well, I can't go to that thing tonight. \n(A BEAT) I don't have anything to wear. The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can. \nEMMA (CONT'D) \n(PERFECT BRITISH) Hello? Alice gestures for Emma not to say anything, to hang up. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 41. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nEMMA (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Oh yes, please. Send it up... Um. Yes, all of it. Everything. Thank you, ever so. Merci! She hangs up and holds a beat before turning to Alice. \nEMMA (CONT'D) My luggage is here. \nINT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY \nAlice and Meg stand in front of the tower of Louis Vuitton trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock of a steel briefcase in her lap. \nALICE Okay. But, just for tonight. And, that's it. CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open briefcase, eyes wide. \nEMMA Lucky guess? \nA necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles like a constellation from within the case's velvet lining. \nALICE \n(CLOSING IT) No jewelry. Emma nods. \nALICE (CONT'D) Then it.all goes back. \nMEG Dry-cleaned. \nINT. LES CASINO DES MONTE CARLO - NIGHT \nThe gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza. Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the tony European jet set. \nMEG A riot. Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot. \nDOMENICO Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten thousand a hand. Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the zeroes on Domenico's chip. \nDOMENICO (CONT'D) You must be feeling very lucky. \nINT. LES CASINO - PRIVATE GAME ROOM - NIGHT \nDEALER Mademoiselle Scott? It is your call. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 46. \nCONTINUED: Emma sits locked in a cool stare-down over the top of her cards with Domenico across from her at the tensed table. Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill. The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp napkin, struggling to breathe. \nMEG (takes bottle from waiter) I should probably keep this. \nDEALER \n(PRODDING) Mademoiselle? Emma places her cards face down before her, appears to fold. \nEMMA Well... She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside her, and pushes them to the center of the table. \nEMMA (CONT'D) \nI'm all in. The other players gasp and Alice fails to suppress a whimper as she grasps Meg's pouring hand, spilling Champagne, drawing Jean-Pierre's attention. \nJEAN-PIERRE Are you alright? \nALICE Great. I'm just--. Excuse me. Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a DOWAGER (60's) in the game. \nALICE (CONT'D) I'm terribly sorry to interrupt. But, Cordelia, you look a little overheated... Why don't we--? \n(WHISPERS LOW) .Have you completely lost your mind? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 47. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nEMMA \n(WHISPER BACK) Hey. Don't distract me. I'm in the middle of a hand-- \nALICE Emma! That isn't Monopoly money! \nEMMA Relax. I've got it under control-- \nALICE And this isn't the mathletes finals in Kenosha! \nEMMA Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and get Alice some water? \n(TO ALICE) You're the one that got us into this--! \nALICE What?! \nDOMENICO I will see you, Cordelia. Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands when the dowager folds her cards. \nEMMA (whisper to Alice) Now, go sit down and try to be cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me handle this. Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes the water Jean-Pierre offers. \nMEG What'd she say? What'd she say? \nALICE \n(SICK) We're going down, Meg. Going down hard. \nDEALER Mademoiselle. Your Highness. Your 0 cards, please. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 48. \nCONTINUED: (3) Alice and Meg turn helplessly to the game table. \nDOMENICO Ladies first. \nEMMA After you. Please. Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his three aces. \nDOMENICO I am very sorry, Cordelia. A beat, then Emma shrugs. \nEMMA Well. It is just a game after all. She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high. \nEMMA (CONT'D) I do hope there are no hard feelings. The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes. Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over, glasses spilling, as the other players applaud. Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both arms, laughing as she's congratulated. \nDOWAGER You must play often, Miss Scott. \nEMMA Oh, a little, online. But, this is so much more fun! \nINT. HOTEL DE PARIS - LOBBY - NIGHT \nDomenico and Jean-Pierre, each toting buckets of chips, escort Alice, Emma and Meg to the elevator, all giddy. \nDOMENICO Not even a last drink in the bar? \n(CONTINUED) \n(FIRMLY) Yes. I am the husband. Glenn nods emphatically. \nINT. VILLA DA SILVANO - NIGHT \nA cascade of yellow and gold balloons washes over Alice as she dances with Meg and Emma to a Euro-trance-pop beat at the center of the crowded dance floor. Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara, batting balloons as Domenico who spins her away.

From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s), squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and tails, watches Emma ardently. He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes. \nEmma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up this offering, and she takes him for a waiter. \nEMMA Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty! Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile, watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks. She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai, really registering his presence now as she searches his warm, gentle eyes. \nEMMA (CONT'D) It's a wonderful party, isn't it? Nikolai nods and offers her another glass of Champagne.

Oh, yeah, of course... Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to match her moves, insinuates himself. She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her back to evade him. Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly. \nMEG No, thanks. She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO (40's, sexy, Euro- suave) who smoothly steps in. \nMEG (CONT'D) \nNO-- \nGIORGIO \n(GRINNING WIDE) Yes!

Alice swivels around at the raised voices, spots Penelope facing Emma. \nALICE \nExcuse me! She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in passing, yanking her away from Giorgio as she heads for Emma. \nPENELOPE Don't pretend you don't remember! Third year at Le Rosey! You threw my luggage in the pool. Set fire to my mattress. You cut off all my \nHAIR-- \nMEG What? That's awful! \nPENELOPE While I was sleeping \nEMMA She did that to you? \nMEG (CONT'D) I thought I was his partner. Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on. \nGIORGIO You heart feels betrayed. \nMEG (telling a secret) I feel like I failed. \nGIORGIO I tell you this: A man...he will always love the mother of his children. Meg blinks, taking this in. \nGIORGIO (CONT'D) Now you must kiss someone else. \nMEG \n(LAUGHS) Oh, I see-- \nGIORGIO To break the spell. You must! Then you will be free. A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the table in front of Meg. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 66. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMEG Oh, I'm sorry, 'I didn't order-- She looks up to find Bernard standing in chef's whites. \nBERNARD (smiles, nods) Madame Kelly.

Thanks! \nNIKOLAI Ti takaya vaskhititel'naya. Emma sets the bottle down to concentrate on Nikolai. \nEMMA You're not from here, are you? \n(OVER-ENUNCIATING) I'm Emm--.

This is why we have to go-- \nEMMA Doesn't it mean we have to stay? \nMEG Oh, this is so typical. Just because it's not on your map, 'cause you didn't plan it--. We all agree to take this adventure and then you won't jump. \nALICE I won't--? Jump? Meg drops into a chair, mumbling an aside to herself. \nMEG Now I know how Richard must feel.

Alice, if you think we should go, then that's what we're gonna do. You're in charge. Meg scoffs, an exasperated exhale. \nALICE No way. Not anymore I'm not. You want to go to the beach? Go to the beach. You want to go the market? Go! \"Liberte, egalite, fraternite!\" \nEMMA What does that mean? Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door. \nALICE It means everyone should do exactly what they want. \nMEG Exactly. \nEMMA Alice, wait! Where are you--? You're not going back to Paris--? \nALICE \n(RIGHTEOUS) Me?

MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING \nAlice feeds the little dog a scrap of meat as she eats a kabob, seated on the curb by a street vendor's food cart around which ALGERIAN MEN lounge in plastic lawn chairs.

As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces off the curb and rolls to a stop beside her.

YACHT PARTY - EVENING \nEmma wears Cordelia's elaborate necklace, standing alone, within a throng of PARTY GOERS, all conversing in French. she nods and smiles absently, though she's clearly lost, out of her element, when Giorgio approaches. \nGIORGIO Where is Meg?

Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie, a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other. Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile. \nEMMA Niki. He bows slightly, offering the cake. \nEMMA (CONT'D) You work here too? You never get a night off... He smiles, shaking his head, hands her the cake. \nNIKOLAI Ya sa-meey shas-li-veey che-lo-vek na zem-le, pa-ta-mu chto u me-nya yest' tee.

She's not scared of anything-- \nBERNARD \n(LAUGHS) Not a chicken. He says, she looks like a rascal. \nMEG \nNo idea where she gets that...

I'm not getting on that thing. Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics. \nBERNARD \n(AMIABLY) \nC'est bon. Au revoir. He swings a leg over the moped, revs the engine. \nALICE (V.O.) Well, Africa, then. How often do you get to go? He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the building that faces the sea and the lightening sky. \nJEAN-PIERRE (V.0.) Not enough.

HOTEL DE PARIS - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER \nAlice's smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she leans against the hotel's crown beside Jean-Pierre. \nALICE That seems a shame... \nJEAN-PIERRE But, I can think of one place I have never been. It is in my imagination only, so it is very special. He places an arm around Alice as they take in the view. \nJEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D) It is just a small town, in a vast, open space. Maybe in the middle of America. There are people there like yourself, who are kind. And children who have everything they need. Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair in his fingers, and they hold a beat, looking at one another. \nJEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D) In my mind, it is bordered by fields that are green. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 87. \nCONTINUED: 0 Alice breaks the moment by turning her head to search the far horizon just as the rising sun crests the open sea. \nEXT.

Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown. Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run, hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH! He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in with a SPLASH! She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game, and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain. They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him. A beat as they sober. \nEmma pulls Nikolai close to her, and they kiss.

Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from her shoulders. \nALICE Before this, I'd never even been to France. Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself. \nALICE (CONT'D) It's true. Just kept putting it off. Always managed to find an excuse. But, really, it was that I was afraid. That it couldn't ever live up to the France I'd imagined. And if it did... Then I'd never be able to go home. \nJEAN-PIERRE And, now? Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and steps near to kiss him on the lips. \nALICE But, thank you.

No, I do not see a driver. Yes, I am looking! The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit. Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the attendant corrects him, pointing the other way. \nRICHARD Merci.

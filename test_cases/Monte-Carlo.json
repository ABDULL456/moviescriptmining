{"train": "MONTE CARLO \nWritten by \nRon Bass \nBased on the novel \n\"HEADHUNTERS\" \nby Jules Bass \nTHIRD DRAFT November 4, 2007 \nOVER BLACK: \nALICE (V.0.) Think of the future, and events that will have already happened. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color, chalks \"Futur Anterieur\" in precise cursive at the board. \nALICE \"By tomorrow, we will have flown to France.\" She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS. Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior. \nALICE (CONT'D) Who can give me an example? Paul? NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be \nread as in FRENCH with ENGLISH subtitles. \nPAUL \"I will have completed the assigned translation by the end of vacation.\" \nALICE C'est bon! Amber? \nAMBER I will have failed French again by the end of the year. Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy. \nALICE En francais si'l vows plait? \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nEMMA So, the definition of the derivative of the function \"f\" at point \"x\" is..? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 2. \nCONTINUED: EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex calculus formula at the board while all of her TWELFTH GRADE MALE STUDENTS avidly admire her shape in a tight, stylish skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly. \nEMMA (CONT'D) Okay! Kyle? KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover. \nKYLE Um... I guess I'm a little lost. If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a level of wilfulness is required. \nEMMA Try to follow along. I really want you guys to get this! David? DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog. \nEMMA (CONT'D) Cindy? \nIS \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - HOME ARTS LAB - DAY \nTWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast. The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room. Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup, Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference. She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls leap back with a shriek, shakes her head. The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly snuffing the flames. They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke. \nMEG Do me a favor, and let's just try to get to vacation. The class bell RINGS! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 3. \nCONTINUED: \nMEG (CONT'D) You can burn the school down as soon as we're back. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nAlice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats, exit the school among a crush of students. Together, they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow, to the parking lot, stopping at Alice's weathered Volvo where Richard hands over the binders with a kiss. \nRICHARD Got practice until five thirty, then I'll be by. \nALICE I'll see you then. Thanks. They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves. \nRICHARD Hey, Meg! Bon voyage! Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car. \nALICE I finished our travel binders! Meg takes the binder, looks it over. \nMEG Remind me again why we're taking phonebooks to France? Alice gives her a look. \nMEG (CONT'D) I love my binder. I do. \nALICE Where's Emma? She knows we're meeting, right? \nMEG Forgot her purse. (watching the students) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 4. \nCONTINUED: \nFINN Can we get on the radio? \nMEG GLENN No. No. Meg watches her kids run to the squad car parked at the curb, just as KARYN (30's, also in uniform) emerges on the passenger side to meet them. \nGLENN And no lights! \nKARYN Hey, Meg! Meg lifts her chin in greeting, but that's it. \nGLENN I uh... I heard from my lawyer. She said you'd signed your papers. Meg watches her kids climb in the car with Karyn. \nGLENN (CONT'D) Guess that makes us official, then. \nMEG You and me? (a nod to the car) Or... \nGLENN You and me, Meg. A beat as they look at one another, hold. \nSEAMUS Mom! Seamus reappears, charging up the walk to pull Meg down to his level, hugging her. \nSEAMUS (CONT'D) Have fun. \nINT. EMMA'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEmma's packed suitcases stand neatly arranged by the door of the sparsely furnished, undecorated room. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 S. \nCONTINUED: \nANSWERING MACHINE You have no messages. Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the record button on her answering machine, then speaks with a put-on, coolly sophisticated,'jet-setting accent. \nEMMA Hello. You've reached the home of Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't be able to return your call right away, as I'm currently traveling. In Europe. But, please, do leave a message. \nTV ANNOUNCER \". .She was known as 'The People's Princess'... Emma turns at the counter to see Princes Diana touring an African encampment with children on the television. \nEMMA Ooh! She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved Lean Cuisine dinner. She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the cards, shuffling. Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp. \nEXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAlice opens the door, kissing Richard who holds up a suitcase in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other. \nRICHARD Special delivery. \nINT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory as Richard pours the Champagne into two glasses. \nALICE That's it! I am good to go! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 9. \nCONTINUED: Richard brings a glass to Alice, nuzzles her ear. \nRICHARD I'm proud of you, you know. Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed, climbing on top of him. \nALICE Like Christmas when I was a kid. There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight-- \nRICHARD Good for me. They kiss. \nALICE I mean, how long have I been talking about this? \nRICHARD Mmm... You were reading Colette. In the teacher's lounge. First time we met. Long time. Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) This is just the beginning. \nALICE \n(BRIGHTENING) It feels like it. They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass back then stop mid-sip to peer down at the delicate diamond ring sitting at the bottom of her glass. \nALICE (CONT'D) \n(STUNNED) Oh. Richard... It's so... It's beautiful... Richard takes her glass and fishes out the ring. \nRICHARD Let's try it on. \nALICE But, we can't even celebrate-- \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 10. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRICHARD What are you talking about? We're \nCELEBRATING-- \nALICE But, I'm leaving. I'm--. I'm getting on a plane in the morning. \nRICHARD \n(LAUGHS) Maybe I want to make sure you come \nBACK-- (stops, sobers) Wait. You're serious. Are you serious? You're serious. \nALICE But, we haven't been-- \nMADAME VALERY Which is why you must follow my flag! \nALICE okay. We will. I promise. But, these people haven't seen the \nCATHEDRAL--- \nMADAME VALERY There are many churches on the tour. \nALICE But, this is Notre Dame! They need to see this-- \nMADAME VALERY I assure you, they will see everything they need to see-- \nALICE \n(LOSING IT) Well, what's the point if it's all a big fat blur? When nobody can see anything properly? Let alone experience it, or appreciate-- \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 21. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMADAME VALERY You seem quite the Paris expert, for someone who has never been. \nEMMA Ill bet she knows more about it than you! The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera. \nALICE I might not have ever been here before, but... \n(EMOTIONAL) I've waited my whole life for this trip. \nCARL We've waited thirty years-- \nMEG You tell her, Carl. \nALICE You keep rushing us through, like this is some kind of race-- \n(REALLY HURT) And you won't even speak French with me. \n(SGUARES HERSELF) Now, I think I've been very nice. We're from Wisconsin. But, I'm telling you, I am not getting on that bus until my friends and I have seen Notre Dame. Meg and Emma exchange looks as Alice plants herself with folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery. \nMADAME VALERY Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied with my tour she could conduct her own. \nEMMA What'd she say? Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks. CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff, the sound of the shutter triggering Alice to action. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 22. \nCONTINUED: (3) With lightning speed, she seizes Madame Valery's flag. \nCROWD Whoa! Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag, but Alice jerks it further away, while the Japanese woman snaps picture after picture. \nDEEDEE Carl, we're getting on the bus! Madame Valery lunges for the stick. \nEXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY \nThe bus pulls away, revealing the Japanese couple who return Emma's camera with a bow, Meg, and Alice holding the flag. \nEMMA That was fantastic! \nMEG \"A\" plus! Alice, cheeks flushed, watches Carl waving goodbye from the \nbus's rear window. \nMEG (CONT'D) Alice, you okay? Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in two, casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises herself to her full height. \nALICE Now, the real tour can begin! \nMEG Let's kick this town's ass! Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall. \nEMMA I think it's starting to rain-- \nALICE Who cares? We're in Paris! What's a little rain? \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 23. \nEXT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - NIGHT \nWater pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of the hotel's canopy. They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their sopping clothes. \nPHOTOGRAPHER 1 Cordelia! They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera flashes in taking Emma's picture. Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer admonishes the first. \nPHOTOGRAPHER 2 You're wasting your film. That's not her. \nEMMA What're they saying? \nAlice looks about in equal confusion, but stops short when she sees the opulent restaurant behind the window's glass. \nALICE Oh. Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant tables inside as the rain hammers down. \nALICE (CONT'D) That, mes aims, is Paris. \nEMMA You think they'd let me use the bathroom? \nINT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT \n(PERFECT MIMIC) Darling, I was thinking of ordering this entire menu, and then not eating it! \nThe waiter retreats, joining FIVE others standing at discreet, fearful attention, all careful not to look at Emma whom they've clearly mistaken her for Cordelia. \nMEG We should just take it. Her room. \nEMMA And her trip to Monte Carlo! \n(TO ALICE) That's still France, right? \nMEG Alice, how fast can you get a binder going on a trip like that? \nALICE \n(LAUGHS) Oh, I'd love to see that. Us in Monte Carlo. \nMEG What's so funny about that? We got in here. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 28. \nCONTINUED: \nEMMA \n(MIMICKING) Indeed. It is pitiful how low the standards here have fallen. Two waiters step in to clear plates, hearing all. \nEMMA (CONT'D) \n(MIMICKING) Remind me to have Daddy buy this hotel so that I can knock it down. Alice and Meg laugh with Emma as the waiters head for the kitchen in panic. \nWAITER (whispers to other) She is a monster! \nMEG Emma, you could be her! \nEMMA \n(MIMICKING) Darling, Meg. Always making me laugh! \n(DROPPING IT) Who in their right mind would ever believe that I was-- \nMANAGER Pardon, Mademoiselle Scott? The three look up at the manager in surprise. \nALICE I'm so sorry. Were we being too loud? \nMANAGER No, no, we are all very happy to see Mademoiselle Scott smile... A WINE STEWARD hustles up to the table with an ice bucket stand and a bottle of Champagne. \nMANAGER (CONT'D) Please. In apology for our earlier misunderstanding. \nEMMA Our misunder--? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 29. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMANAGER Your dinners as well. With our compliments... The three women exchange glances as the steward begins to open the bottle and the manager bows, backing away. \nEMMA Excuse me, Monsieur? \nMANAGER Oui, Mademoiselle? Emma smiles, broadly, batting her eyelashes as the steward pops the Champagne cork. \nEMMA \n(PERFECT BRITISH) I so hate to be a bother, but I seem to have misplaced my room key. \nINT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT \nCLICK! The door swings open into the dark room, framing the three drunk laughing women. \nAlice fumbles for a switch, hitting the lights, and their laughter cuts abruptly at the sumptuous interior of gleaming marble, gilt and silk. \nME G \nHOLY-- \nEMMA Scheize. Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of French doors. \nALICE A view! There's a view. Alice races to push back the window sheers, revealing a staggering panorama of the city, the Seine, and the Eiffel tower in the pouring rain. The entire city of light is reflected in her eyes. \nEMMA (O.S.) Now this is more like it! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 30. \nCONTINUED: \nMEG There's whole other room in here! \nINT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - SUITE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nAlice enters, steering around a tower of Louis Vuitton luggage, as Meg pulls a fresh bottle of Champagne from a bucket of ice. \nALICE Wait. What are you guys doing? Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed. \nEMMA \n(SNATCHING IT) Thanks again! They break for the door, but the manager follows. \nMANAGER I'm afraid there may still be some \nPHOTOGRAPHERS OUTSIDE-- \nEMMA What? \nEXT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - DAY \nAs they emerge, the manager and doormen hustle Alice, Emma and Meg towards a waiting car and driver, as paparazzi call and shoot from across the boulevard. \nALICE Thank you so much but I think we'll \nWALK-- \nMANAGER \n(LAUGHS) But, you can not walk to the airport. \nALICE \n(STOPS FAST) The airport? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 34. \nCONTINUED: A beat, as Emma and Meg look to Alice for direction and the frenzied calls of the paparazzi increase. \nINT. CAR - MOVING - DAY \nALICE It's fine. It's fine. We'll just have him drop us off... Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who waves them farewell, the doorman shooing photographers. \nMEG They really do think she's her... RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's contents. \nEMMA What? I want to know where we're going. \nALICE We're going back to our hotel-- Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin. \nEMMA No. We're going to Monte Carlo! \nALICE No. We're not. \nMEG \n(TAKING ITINERARY) Let me see that-- \nEMMA Alice, what's \"prive?\" Is that like an airline? \nALICE Emma, for crying out loud. Meg, you want to help me out here? \nMEG Hold on... I'm reading... \nEMMA See? Meg wants to go. Don't you, Meg? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 35. \nCONTINUED: \nALICE No, Meg, doesn't. Meg looks up from the itinerary, shrugs. \nMEG Trip's paid for, whether that girl takes it or not. \nALICE Oh! And somehow that magically makes taking it right? \nEMMA What's the worst that could happen? \nALICE I can think of a lot of things-- \nMEG You're in charge. You want to go back to that hotel, okay by me. A beat while Alice looks between Meg and Emma, trapped. \nMEG (CONT'D) \nTotally your call. \nEMMA \n(FULL-ON CORDELIA) And, darling, we'll completely understand if you feel we shouldn't go. \nEXT. AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY \nThe car drives across the wide stretch of runway on a trajectory for a waiting private jet. \nINT. PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT - DAY \nThe women swivel around in their plush seats at the POP! of a cork as a STEWARD opens a bottle of Champagne. \nALICE Okay. We go. We take a look around. We get on a train and come right back... \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 36. \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 39. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nJEAN-PIERRE \nBUT-- \nALICE We're very sorry-- \nJEAN-PIERRE \n(MOUNTING ANXIETY) Perhaps we have misunderstood each other. Mademoiselle Scott--. She must be there for tonight's game. The prince. His Highness has asked to be seated across from her-- \nEMMA What's he saying? Which prince? Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three. \nJEAN-PIERRE Please. It is for the foundation. \nINT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY \nWithin a glossy brochure: A collage of \"snapshots\" shows happy African children grouped outside their new school; raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom; finding their country on a glossy globe. \nALICE \n(ANGUISHED) Oh, would you look at these kids? \nMEG No, I can't. I can't stand it. Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay. \nEMMA \"With your help The Michand Foundation is able to sow the seeds of education, transforming lives, families, and villages, one child at a time...\" She didn't say anything about a school! \nMEG Schools, with an \"s.\" More than one. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 40 \nCONTINUED: \nALICE \n(MISERABLE) In Africa. \nMEG That horrible, irresponsible girl! I've never stolen a thing in my life, now I've taken a trip from school children. \nALICE In Africa. Meg hangs her head. \nEMMA Reykjavik! That takes some nerve! They're counting on her for a charity auction and she doesn't even show up! \nALICE Only she did. Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket. \nEMMA She did? \nMEG Do not touch that! \nALICE You, Emma. If you're Cordelia. They've seen you. You're here. \nEMMA Well, I can't go to that thing tonight. \n(A BEAT) I don't have anything to wear. The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can. \nEMMA (CONT'D) \n(PERFECT BRITISH) Hello? Alice gestures for Emma not to say anything, to hang up. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 41. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nEMMA (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Oh yes, please. Send it up... Um. Yes, all of it. Everything. Thank you, ever so. Merci! She hangs up and holds a beat before turning to Alice. \nEMMA (CONT'D) My luggage is here. \nINT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY \nAlice and Meg stand in front of the tower of Louis Vuitton trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock of a steel briefcase in her lap. \nALICE Okay. But, just for tonight. And, that's it. CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open briefcase, eyes wide. \nEMMA Lucky guess? \nA necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles like a constellation from within the case's velvet lining. \nALICE \n(CLOSING IT) No jewelry. Emma nods. \nALICE (CONT'D) Then it.all goes back. \nMEG Dry-cleaned. \nINT. LES CASINO DES MONTE CARLO - NIGHT \nThe gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza. Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the tony European jet set. \nMEG A riot. Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot. \nDOMENICO Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten thousand a hand. Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the zeroes on Domenico's chip. \nDOMENICO (CONT'D) You must be feeling very lucky. \nINT. LES CASINO - PRIVATE GAME ROOM - NIGHT \nDEALER Mademoiselle Scott? It is your call. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 46. \nCONTINUED: Emma sits locked in a cool stare-down over the top of her cards with Domenico across from her at the tensed table. Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill. The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp napkin, struggling to breathe. \nMEG (takes bottle from waiter) I should probably keep this. \nDEALER \n(PRODDING) Mademoiselle? Emma places her cards face down before her, appears to fold. \nEMMA Well... She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside her, and pushes them to the center of the table. \nEMMA (CONT'D) \nI'm all in. The other players gasp and Alice fails to suppress a whimper as she grasps Meg's pouring hand, spilling Champagne, drawing Jean-Pierre's attention. \nJEAN-PIERRE Are you alright? \nALICE Great. I'm just--. Excuse me. Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a DOWAGER (60's) in the game. \nALICE (CONT'D) I'm terribly sorry to interrupt. But, Cordelia, you look a little overheated... Why don't we--? \n(WHISPERS LOW) .Have you completely lost your mind? \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 47. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nEMMA \n(WHISPER BACK) Hey. Don't distract me. I'm in the middle of a hand-- \nALICE Emma! That isn't Monopoly money! \nEMMA Relax. I've got it under control-- \nALICE And this isn't the mathletes finals in Kenosha! \nEMMA Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and get Alice some water? \n(TO ALICE) You're the one that got us into this--! \nALICE What?! \nDOMENICO I will see you, Cordelia. Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands when the dowager folds her cards. \nEMMA (whisper to Alice) Now, go sit down and try to be cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me handle this. Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes the water Jean-Pierre offers. \nMEG What'd she say? What'd she say? \nALICE \n(SICK) We're going down, Meg. Going down hard. \nDEALER Mademoiselle. Your Highness. Your 0 cards, please. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 48. \nCONTINUED: (3) Alice and Meg turn helplessly to the game table. \nDOMENICO Ladies first. \nEMMA After you. Please. Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his three aces. \nDOMENICO I am very sorry, Cordelia. A beat, then Emma shrugs. \nEMMA Well. It is just a game after all. She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high. \nEMMA (CONT'D) I do hope there are no hard feelings. The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes. Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over, glasses spilling, as the other players applaud. Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both arms, laughing as she's congratulated. \nDOWAGER You must play often, Miss Scott. \nEMMA Oh, a little, online. But, this is so much more fun! \nINT. HOTEL DE PARIS - LOBBY - NIGHT \nDomenico and Jean-Pierre, each toting buckets of chips, escort Alice, Emma and Meg to the elevator, all giddy. \nDOMENICO Not even a last drink in the bar? \n(CONTINUED) \nA SHOP OWNER (60's) slips a pair of freshly polished men's shoes into a paper bag, placing them on the counter in front of Richard, who pulls out his wallet. \nRICHARD \n(REMEMBERING) Oh. And the suitcase. The shop owner retrieves Alice's mended suitcase from a nearby shelf, a tag on the zipper. \nRICHARD (CONT'D) How much do I owe you for that? \nEXT. STRIP MALL - DAY \nRichard exits the shoe repair carrying Alice'.s repaired suitcase, headed for his car. \nGLENN Hey, Richard! Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with Seamus and Finn, pushing a cart piled high with groceries. \nCUT TO: Richard finishes helping Glenn and the kids transfer grocery bags to the open trunk of Glenn's squad car. \nGLENN (CONT'D) \n(CLOSING TRUNK) So, we'll see you at seven then-- \nRICHARD And that's two with sausage, extra sauce, no onions-- \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 53. \nCONTINUED: \nSEAMUS Thin crust. \nRICHARD Got it. Richard picks up Alice's suitcase. \nFINN Are you going to France, too? \nRICHARD No. I just-- Glenn turns, noticing the suitcase for the first time. \nGLENN Whoa! Hold on! You're going to surprise Alice--? \nFINN I love surprises! \nRICHARD What? No, I--- \nGLENN Oh, man, I win! Richard blinks as Glenn claps him on the shoulder. \nGLENN (CONT'D) Meg and I've had this bet going: She thought it would be on Alice's next birthday, but I knew it was going to be this trip to France! \nRICHARD Glenn, listen-- \nGLENN Don't worry! I won't blow it for you! I won't call anyone, ruin the \nSURPRISE-- \n(PLAYFUL PUNCH) You sly dog! You've probably booked the best suite in Paris. Am I right? Got the ring, the whole show--. This is so you! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 54. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRICHARD (confused, but flattered) So...me? \nGLENN Sure! That's why Alice loves you. You get how much this trip's meant to her; now, you're just putting the icing on the cake. The big gesture, you know? Not too dominating: Supportive. Loving! (shakes his head) You're the man, Richard. Big props. Glenn pulls Richard into a big happy bear hug. \nGLENN (CONT'D) Congratulations. \nRICHARD Glenn. She said, no. \nEXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY \nBERNARD ROCHAND (late 30's), an appealing Frenchman in a worn \nsportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on the other side of the open stall. He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce, lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile. Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and down her front. She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement. Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along the line of stalls. Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to prepare the fish they both admire. Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of it to gesture responses. The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and thrusts it towards Meg with a smile. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 55. \nCONTINUED: \nMEG Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. I'd like to. But... The woman is confused, vaguely insulted. \nMEG (CONT'D) I don't have a kitchen. No place to cook. \nBERNARD She is only a visitor. Without a kitchen. But, it is a beautiful fish. Maybe next time. Meg turns to find Bernard beside her. \nBERNARD (CONT'D) I have explained. Meg hesitates uncertainly before this friendly stranger. \nMEG Well, thank you... She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to find \nBernard falling into step with her. \nBERNARD You are American. Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious, drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges with various vendors as they walk. \nMEG From Wisconsin. Yes. Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg. \nBERNARD You cook in Wisconsin? Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice. \n(FIRMLY) Yes. I am the husband. Glenn nods emphatically. \nINT. VILLA DA SILVANO - NIGHT \nA cascade of yellow and gold balloons washes over Alice as she dances with Meg and Emma to a Euro-trance-pop beat at the center of the crowded dance floor. Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara, batting balloons as Domenico who spins her away.

I'm so thirsty! Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile, watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks. She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai, really registering his presence now as she searches his warm, gentle eyes. \nEMMA (CONT'D) It's a wonderful party, isn't it?

Alice swivels around at the raised voices, spots Penelope facing Emma. \nALICE \nExcuse me!

LOUVRE - DAY \nMadame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory.

Pardon, Monsieur-- \nCARL \n(RECEIVING CATSUP) Merci! He turns now, catsup in hand, to blink at the creme brulee that has replaced his own and Deedee's steaks. \nAlice places a hand on Madam Valery's arm as she passes. \nALICE Pardon, Madame, but...

LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which they stand; dingy, impossibly small, crowded by an armoire that nearly meets the low sloping ceiling, with two spindly twin beds and a military-style cot. \nEMMA Toujour le suck-ez vous. \nALICE I researched at least a million \nTOURS-- \nMEG Well.

Alice, help-- Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift. \nALICE Emma, what have you got in here? \nEMMA Just the stuff you put on my list-- (off her look) And a couple options. The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom. \nEMMA (CONT'D) Hey! Come on, guys! \nINT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT \nAlice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and the ugly backsides of buildings, as Meg and Emma sleep fitfully behind her.

Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and her cluster of appreciative followers. \nMADAME VALERY People! We must keep together! \nEXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL -- DAY \nAlice's group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a star-shaped brass inset on the pavement outside Notre Dame. \nDEEDEE \"Point zero.

Alice, if you think we should go, then that's what we're gonna do. You're in charge. Meg scoffs, an exasperated exhale. \nALICE No way. Not anymore I'm not. You want to go to the beach? Go to the beach. You want to go the market? Go! \"Liberte, egalite, fraternite!\" \nEMMA What does that mean?

LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - DAY \nRichard steps from the hotel with a MANAGER (50's) who pantomimes that he recognizes Alice from the snapshot Richard shows him, but has no idea where she could be. Richard pulls out a map to point at a random spot and the manager gestures up the street, down the street, shrugging: She could be anywhere. \nEXT. GRIMALDI PALACE - DAY \nAlice, amid a crowd of tourists, only half watches the changing of the guards outside the palace gates. She snaps herself out of her distraction with a shake of her head and turns to the marked pages in her guide book. \nCARL Alice? She glances up to find Carl and Deedee from the tour. \nDEEDEE We thought that was you! \nALICE Oh! Carl! Deedee! Alice is surprisingly overcome and impulsively throws her arms around both of them. \nDEEDEE Well, we're sure surprised to see you, too! \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 76. \nCONTINUED: \nALICE But, what are you doing here?

PARIS - ARC DE TRIOMPHE - DAY \nRichard stands with his map beneath the arch where all roads come together in a spinning roundabout of bleating car horns.

The car pulls away, Carl and Deedee turning in their seats to wave at Alice through the rear window. Alice waves until they are out of sight and slowly lowers her hand, standing alone in the street. A beat. Alice sighs and pulls out her guide book, unfolding a map as she looks up to gather her bearings. She takes in the quiet street, the view of the ocean, then looks back at the map in her hands. \nShe straightens up, a new look of purpose on her face, and crosses the street to toss her guide book and map in the trash can on the corner, striking out unaided down a narrow twisting street hung with vines and flowers. \nEXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING \nAlice rounds the corner of one street into the tight intersection of two narrow alleys in the fading twilight. She looks around,.cheeks flushed, hair pasted to her forehead, lost in a maze of dilapidated walled courtyards and apartment blocks; home to the city's service workers. She hesitates, then forges ahead down one street until she sees that it dead ends, and she doubles back. \nEXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING \nAlice suppresses panic as she walks briskly up a steep alley, high in the hills, trailed now by a small stray DOG. She stops, turns to the dog that also stops then sits. \nALICE is Go. Go home. \n(CONTINUED) \nMonte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 78. \nCONTINUED: She turns and starts forward, the dog following.

HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON \nPenelope, dressed for the evening, gets up from reclining on the bed to join Emma who models a gown before a mirror. The two regard Emma's reflection, cocking their heads in an identical manner at precisely the same time. Penelope draws a necklace in gesture, indicating Emma's bare \ncollar bone.

It is in my imagination only, so it is very special. He places an arm around Alice as they take in the view. \nJEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D) It is just a small town, in a vast, open space. Maybe in the middle of America. There are people there like yourself, who are kind. And children who have everything they need.

YACHT - DAWN \nNikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand before Emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts. He lifts his hands: This is me. Here I am. Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown. Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run, hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH! He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in with a SPLASH! She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game, and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain. They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him. A beat as they sober. \nEmma pulls Nikolai close to her, and they kiss. On the landing deck, Emma's gown shimmers in the morning sun with Nikolai's crown and Cordelia's yellow gem and diamond necklace nestled among its satin folds. \nINT.

Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from her shoulders. \nALICE Before this, I'd never even been to France. Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself. \nALICE (CONT'D) It's true. Just kept putting it off. Always managed to find an excuse. But, really, it was that I was afraid. That it couldn't ever live up to the France I'd imagined. And if it did... Then I'd never be able to go home. \nJEAN-PIERRE And, now? Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and steps near to kiss him on the lips. \nALICE But, thank you.

No, I do not see a driver. Yes, I am looking! The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit. Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the attendant corrects him, pointing the other way. \nRICHARD Merci. He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a UNIFORMED DRIVER approaches Cordelia. \nDRIVER Mademoiselle Scott? \nCORDELIA Where have you been?

PHIL He wasn't acting? 
ALICE I don't think he knows how. 
Phil looks convinced. Gary doesn't. 
EXT. HIGHWAY/GAS STATION - MORNING 
From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up in the next lane. Ostensibly, they have run into each other on the way to work. They are smiling, casual. 
Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear no connection to their words. 
LISA What about the FBI? 
MILO They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over. 
LISA Who can we trust? 
MILO There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question. 
She defines it: 
LISA How do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person. 
She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless female." He comes over to help her. 
MILO We don't tell anybody. (she's puzzled) We tell everybody. At once. So there's no secret left to protect. When everybody knows, they don't dare touch us. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING 
Bob Shrot is on the phone. Behind him, a nerdy security programmer, LEN DIETZ, is at the console that controls the security cameras (the ones Milo futzed with). 
SHROT (into the phone) No, Tony can't fill in for you, he's not at your authorization level. 
Scrolling, Len knits his brow: he's found something odd. 
LEN Bob? You better look at this. 
EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Milo checks Lisa's oil for her. 
MILO Do we post it on the Net? 
LISA There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Shrot stands over Len's shoulder. 
SHROT Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused? 
LEN Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in? 
SHROT Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa. (walks to the window) I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it. (turns to Len) Let's run a printout on card entries. 
EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Milo shows Lisa the oil stick. She nods. 
LISA The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine. 
MILO Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick. 
LISA We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home. 
MILO Certainly not at my happy home. 
He slams the hood. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
Shrot and Len watch a laser printer, as it spits out line after line after line of swipe card entries... 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
A LASER PRINTER spits out code. We are: 
INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Milo watches new Skywire code emerge from his printer. 
Gary is in the doorway behind him: watching Milo, scrutin- izing him. Sensing someone, Milo turns and looks. 
MILO Gary, hi. 
GARY You look a little tired. 
MILO I'm okay. It's going well! 
GARY 'Have a look? 
MILO Sure.

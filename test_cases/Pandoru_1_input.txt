PAYTON Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake us? 
BOWER Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing around at their darkened surroundings. 
PAYTON Hit the lights, will ya? 
BOWER Ah... we're having some power problems- 
PAYTON Who woke you up? 
BOWER Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here... (off his look) .except us. 
PAYTON Cold in here. BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs. 
BOWER There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the... (searching for word) Dynos. Can't even open the doors. PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown. 
BOWER (CONT'D) (off his look) Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where he is. It was empty when I woke up. None of the systems are on-line. Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or why it engaged independently- 
PAYTON Bower . 
BOWER Yeah? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
PAYTON Until I have two coffees you're just gonna have to repeat all this shit, so let's just idle here for a bit. 
BOWER Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall. 
BOWER (CONT`D) Easy... Lieutenant. Easy. 
PAYTON Coffee? 
BOWER I'm on it. 
PAYTON Good man. BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name- plate reads: LT. PAYTON. 
BOWER This is you, sir. 
PAYTON How do you know that? 
BOWER 1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER (CONT'D) it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss that's- 
PAYTON Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM, sometimes it can take a while to get it back. PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his forearm, partially obscured from view; FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age. 
BOWER I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything. 
PAYTON Listen, the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while to get it all back. BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a wedding ring. 
BOWER What was... your last flight, sir? 
PAYTON 
(BEAT) Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey? Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually. PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife. 
PAYTON (CONT'D) I've gone through this before. I just can't remember why I would agree to do it again. PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a serious tone. 
BOWER Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PAYTON I figured you'd tell me. 
BOWER Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise- 
PAYTON Trust me, it's not. if this is a simulation... PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.

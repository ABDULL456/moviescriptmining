WASTELAND - DAY \n9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war. \nPulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human civilization surround him. \nHe sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front seat of a car. \nBanners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on them. \nachines lie deserted on the sides of roads. \nDistracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears to be a dictator/leader. \n9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened. Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him. \n9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war Machine. \nLOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face. \nScared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a piece of metal lying in front of him. \nThe shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him with all his might. \n9 hits him square in the chest.

I am a friend. \n9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid, but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to help 2 up. \nWe see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him. His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat. \n9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a contagious eagerness and imaginativeness. \n2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on his back. \n(CONT'D) (eagerly, excited, like an intrigued scholar) Yes... yes... I always thought there'd be one more. \nHe nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand. While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding with eager excitement.

Friend? \n(BEAMING) Friend. \n(more and more normal SOUNDING) Are we alone? \n(REASSURING) No. There are others. \nand 2 stare at each other. 9 looks at 2 in wonderment, then reaches out and touches 2's chest where he hit it. \n2 beams at 9, happy 9 can speak, happy he was able to help, and happy that 9, with his first words, is concerned about others. \nglow beams from within 9's chest.   2 stares.   9 removes the TALISMAN from his chest. \n2 has a big reaction--he draws his breath in and looks at it in ASTONISHMENT. \nI \nT \n", "test1_id": 1434, "test2_input": "he dolls run from the blast.    9 and 7 look on in triumph. \nSEQ. 190 - The Dolls Celebrate \nSEQ. 190 - EXT.

BLACK & WHITE.    GRAINY, like OLD DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE. \nSCIENTIST'S VOICE Experiment 208, day 20... \nINT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - DAY \nWe see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the scientist, in a white coat. \nWe pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere. \nWe pull back further to see the back and legs of the DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms. \nDICTATOR Useless. \nSCIENTIST Please.   Give it a chance. \nWe're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it malfunctions. \nDICTATOR (V.O.) One more.      That's all. We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the soldiers accompany him out. \nWe see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the camera to turn it off. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK \nINT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - NIGHT \nThe grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving away from the camera (having just turned it on). \nThe lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box. \nSCIENTIST (tired, but dictating to keep the documentary record complete) My last possible solution.... (muttering to himself) It must work... \nHe gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the machine. \nHis back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting something over his face (but only from behind). \nThere is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS, and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc. \nThe scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run. Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously. \nThe scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets up and comes towards camera. \nWe see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us: CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated. \nPull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new sort of energy. Something new has happened. \nThe scientist switches off the camera and: \nRADIO (V.O.) Reports are coming in... they've breached the Northern walls of the city... \nThe radio voice is DROWNED OUT BY EXPLOSIONS. D \nISSOLVE TO: \nTITLE CARD #4 \nINT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - ANOTHER DAY \nRADIO (V.O.) An announcement from our Chancellor! \nDICTATOR'S VOICE (on the radio) Comrades, I have lost control. The Machine is now our enemy. We need to join forces to fight against it. \nWe hear EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS outside. \nWe see the scientist cobbling together another SMALL BURLAP DOLL, a little more evolved. \nHe labels it \"5,\" then makes notes in a journal. \nTITLE CARD #5 \nSCIENTIST his voice a mere whisper NOW) Five so far....I can't get them right... \nISSOLVE TO: \nTITLE CARD #6 \nINT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - ANOTHER DAY \nRADIO (V.O.) (through static) Gas masks are being distributed... ALERT: beware.... \nWe see the scientist desperately grabbing bits and scraps for one last doll. He is like a skeleton, almost no energy left. \nADIO (V.O.) (cont'd) ...deadly gas.... \nhe radio voice dies out.   We hear nothing but STATIC. \nITLE CARD #7 \nH \nH \nC \nThe scientist totters over, makes a note in his journal. He clutches the little box, and suspends this last doll with a rope in a strange contraption. \nSCIENTIST a feeble whisper) My last one... this one, finally, must work... it must.... \nTITLE CARD #8 \nThe SOUND of the scientist collapsing to the floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSEQ. 020 - Attic \nSEQ. 020 - INT. WORKSHOP - DAY \nThe thin strand of rope stretches... stretches... and \nC \nM \nHe stops and is strangely drawn to the TALISMAN. He turns and takes it, stowing it inside his zippered chest before he heads out. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 029 - 9 Meets 2 \nSEQ. 029 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY \n9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war. \nPulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human civilization surround him. \nHe sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front seat of a car. \nBanners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on them. \nachines lie deserted on the sides of roads. \nDistracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears to be a dictator/leader. \n9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened. Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him. \n9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war Machine. \nLOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face. \nScared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a piece of metal lying in front of him. \nThe shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him with all his might. \n9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2 is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide. \nA \nBut 2 is looking at 9 with surprise.   He struggles to get up, speaking with urgency to 9. \n(firmly, kindly, almost eagerly; like trying to soothe a wild animal) Wait... I am a friend. \nLT: \n2 (CONT'D) (GENTLY) Friend... I am a friend. \n9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid, but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to help 2 up. \nWe see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him. His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat. \n9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a contagious eagerness and imaginativeness. \n2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on his back. \n(CONT'D) (eagerly, excited, like an intrigued scholar) Yes... yes... I always thought there'd be one more. \nHe nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand. While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more sophisticated than 2's. \n2 (CONT'D) The details... how exciting. (FASCINATED) Carved wood... steel bolts... molded copper... \nH \nHe takes it and looks at it.     He gives 9 a look of surprise. \n(CONT'D) But how strange.... muttering to himself as he turns the Talisman in his hands) Yes, he was always drawing this... exactly like this... how strange... \nhey both stare at the TALISMAN. \nSuddenly, a  is heard OFFSCREEN. 2 looks up IN HORROR. He grabs his spear. He pushes 9 away almost fiercely. \nALT: \n2 (CONT'D) (firmly, to 9) GO! \nSEQ. 030 - Cat Beast Attacks \nSEQ. 030 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY \n2 points forcefully to an old rusted can. \n2 runs into the can. stands, ready to attack. \n9 watches 2, wondering what is coming. Then from behind him, a large claw of a mechanical figure settles softly next to 9's can. He tries to call out to 2... \nAnd from behind 2 enters-- \nA HIDEOUS CAT BEAST. \nt is a nail and razor-studded predatory Machine with a cat skull-shaped head, its body laced with bones, nails and razors. 9 now understands 2 was trying to protect him. \nGASPS as he turns and sees it. The Cat Beast lets out a roar and claws at 2, KNOCKING him over and losing his spear. \nlooks on with horror. \nH \nT \n2 attempts to reach for his spear but the Beast holds him down with its razor-sharp feet. \nThe Beast is attracted to the Talisman. It picks it up with one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically. \ncringes.    His movement makes his hiding place teeter, creaking. \nhe Cat Beast WHIRLS at the sound. Picking up 2's struggling body, the Cat Beast stalks towards the noise, right up to 9's hiding place, sniffing through its hollow nostrils. 9 cringes in terror. The Cat Beast probes with one of his claws INTO the tin can. 9 recoils. The claws do not find him and retreat. 9 is relieved. \nA beat, then: \n9 feels himself violently LIFTED UP and SMASHED. \nWe see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and is smashing it to get at what's inside it.   Failing, it hurls the tin can aside. \n9 is almost knocked out. Trying to stay conscious, he struggles towards the entrance of the can. \nis POV: through his haze and through the broken edges of the opening to the can, he sees the Cat Beast GRAB the Talisman and the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, and disappearing into the smoky mist. \n9 can just make out, in the distance, the silhouettes of \nTHREE TALL SHAPES. \n(MUTTERING) The others... \nCUT TO: \n1 carries himself with authority. He wears a red cloak, and a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as an almost papal-like headpiece, and carries a staff made from an old gear, with a bell attached. \npulls at 9 with his staff, displaying the number on his back. \nhat's this? \nturns and glares at 5 like a general glaring at a new private, expecting an explanation for a misdeed. 5 cringes back, obviously intimidated by 1. \n... I found him.... in the emptiness.   He saw-- \n1 HOOKS 5 by the neck with his staff, cutting off his speech. \nWhat? What were you doing out there? \nY \nI saw him from the watchtower and I thought... \nou'll lead The Beast straight back to us! How many times have I told you? \nThe Beast--that's what took 2!   If we hurry we could save him-- \n(CURTLY) If the Beast took him, that's the end of it. \nBut he was still alive-- \n5 turns with sudden hope to 9.   2 might still be alive? \nNo, we have RULES. \n1 smashes his staff against the ground. \nImmediately, a knife comes through the curtain revealing another RAGDOLL: a large ragdoll, with the number \"8\" on his arm. \n(CONT'D) (TO 8) Our new guest seems confused. (condescendingly, to 9) Perhaps I can help you achieve some clarity. \n8 is very large, and designed for great strength. He is almost as evolved in his design as 9, but his design favors primarily brute force. \nHe has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal. He carries the blade of a large kitchen knife, with a nail he has attached for a handle. On his back he has slung another knife--half of a scissors; the scissors handle loops up above his head. \nT \nT \nC \n1 leaves. 8 taps his knife in his hand and motions for 9 and 5 to follow.  They follow. \nUT TO: \nSEQ. 050 - Clock Tower \nSEQ. 050 - INT. CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS \nThey walk through the nave and plane up overhead. \n5 taps 9 covertly. \n(whispering, hopefully) He was still alive? Really? \nI think so-- \nThey hurry off, increasingly enveloped by the YELLOW CLOUD. \nThe yellow CLOUD TRANSITIONS into STEAM... \n(V.O.) (cont'd) The gas killed everything. \nND FLASHBACK. \nSEQ. 057 - 9 Meets 6 \nSEQ. 057 - INT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - CONTINUOUS \nThe steam is rising from the small thurible in the CLOCK TOWER. \n1 (V.O.) I led us here... \n1 is now standing at the thurible with a torch in his hand. \n1 (V.O.) (cont'd) ...to sanctuary. And here we waited for the war to end. \nT \nT \nHe puts his hand around 9's shoulders and walks him over to the other side of the room. \n(CONT'D) Slowly, the world became silent. \n1 and 9 walk over to a picture of the Cat Beast hanging on the wall. \n1 (CONT'D) The only thing that remains now is the Beast. \n1 faces 9 as the torch slowly fades. \n1 (CONT'D) So we stay hidden and we wait for it, too, to sleep. \nhe torch burns out. 9 looks at 1. \nBut where did it come from?   Why is it hunting us? \nQuestions like that are pointless. We need to protect ourselves. Keep ourselves out of danger. \nBut one of us is in trouble... he could still be rescued... turns and walks to a tattered calendar page on the wall with the days 3, 4, and 7 crossed off. \noo many of us have already been lost. \n1 crosses 2's number off the calendar with the burnt end of his torch. \nNo! You're not listening. He may still be alive! Why won't you try to save him? Why won't you-- \n1 angrily SMACKS HIS STAFF ON THE FLOOR. \nO \nEnough! Enough of this madness! (to 5, annoyed) Go to the watch tower and take our guest with you. \n5 meekly immediately obeys, gesturing to 9 to follow him. \nWe hear a strange WHISPERING SOUND, and CAMERA, instead of following 5 and 9, stays behind and moves in on a shadowy little area. There, we see 6. 6 is ink-stained and has a strange quality, as though he sees and hears things inside his head that only he experiences. He has a SMALL SKELETON KEY around his neck, and his fingers are made of PEN NIBS. He is drawing on a piece of paper and WHISPERING TO HIMSELF. \nmuttering, whispering) The source.... The source... \n9 (CONT'D) (COAXING) Come with me. I can't do it alone. \nis terribly torn. He wants to, but he's never done anything like this before. He's always done as he's told. He hesitates: \n(HESITATING) I... I... (MORE) \n(he can't odo 'd) he can't 5(c nt it, DEFY 1) I can't. \n9 looks directly into his eyes. He knows how 5 loved and admired his mentor and everything he did. He understands that 5 would like to be like 2, to do what 2 would have done. \n(GENTLY) But wouldn't he have come for you? \n9 waits, hopefully. But 5 looks away. He wants to do it, but he doesn't have the nerve. 9 nods, compassionately. He turns away. 5 hesitates, looking down, then: \n(more determined) Wait! \n5 grabs the map off the wall and rolls it up.   He walks towards 9. \n5 (CONT'D) You're going to need a map. \n9 and 5 smile at each other. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 070 - Wasteland \nSEQ. 070 - EXT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY \n9 and 5 look behind them at the Cathedral as they start to make their journey to find 2. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 070 - EXT. WASTELAND -- DAY \n5 and 9 pick their way through the rubble. They have traveled miles from the Cathedral. Mist swirls in front of them, obscuring their path. and 9 look around constantly, on the alert for the Cat Beast. Piles of rusted, broken metal machines, broken skeletal bones, exploded vehicles tipped into craters, and crumbling, disintegrating buildings surround them. \nH \nT \n9 looks up and 5 follows his gaze to 2's STAFF stuck in a pile of rubble atop a hill. \n5 hurries up the hill. 9 follows him. 5 turns to FIND 2's hat lying in the dirt. He bends down to pick it up, brushing the dust off the top. 5 looks sadly at 2's broken hat. \n(QUIETLY) You looked out for him? \n(SIMPLY) He looked out for me.    He taught me. \nhe spoon-light falls off.      5's face is filled with grief. \n(CONT'D) Why was he out here alone? \nHe slumps.    9 puts his hand on 5's shoulder, reassuring him. \nWe can still find him. \ne stands up, determinedly. 5 hesitates, but then, his face filling with hope, gets up too. 5 puts 2's hat on his quiver. 9 offers 2's staff to 5 but 5 gestures to 9 for him to hold it. \nThey continue on, through the debris and devastation.     A storm is starting to come up. The wind howls loudly. \n(BITTERLY) Why was he out here alone? \nA terrible grief suddenly comes over him as he remembers what has happened to 2. \nputs his hand on 5's shoulder, bracing him. \n(FIRMLY) Yes. He will. \n9 is conveying with his simple words that he believes 2 IS still alive and he WILL be impressed when he sees the lightstaff. \n9 shines the light to gesture \"this way.\" \n5 smiles tremulously at 9, almost more grateful for his sympathy and support than necessarily believing him. He follows 9 to the mouth of the trench. \nThe camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side wall indicating this is the same trench we saw the Cat Beast travel through earlier. \n5 recoils, but 9 puts a calming hand on him again, then puts both hands on the lightstaff and enters the trench. 5 takes a deep breath and follows. \nT \nA \nSEQ. 075 - INT. TRENCH - LATER \n9 and 5 continue down the trench, both looking around with great caution and nervousness. \ns they come around a corner they see-- \nThe CAT BEAST. \n9 AND 5 \n5 springs into action shooting his weapon at the Beast.    9 shines his light up to see... an old hanging gas mask. \nhey look at each other and LAUGH as they continue down the trench. \n9 AND 5 (cont'd) \nThe mask DROPS behind them and they SCREAM and run away. \n9 AND 5 (cont'd) \nCUT TO: \nA SHADOW (WITH A BIRD SKULL HEAD) AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TRENCH \nSomeone is watching them. \nSEQ. 075 - INT. CLIMBING UP A \"HILL\" OF SAND BAGS - LATER \n5 and 9 climb up a hill of sand bags.. \nThey come around a corner. \n(DISCOURAGED) We've been here before... it's no use. \nsteps over and pushes some debris aside.    Suddenly they can see they are right next to.... \nT \nT \nL \n9 gets cornered but swipes the Beast and manages to escape. 9 jumps a heap of debris but stumbles. 5 and 2 pull him up to higher ground. \nshoots his crossbow at the Cat Beast, shattering his eye. \n2 manages to hide in a tube. \n9 and 5 run away but get stuck at the end of a table. \nThe Cat Beast slashes his claw at them. \nT \nS \nS \nT \nThey climb onto another piece of debris, only to encounter the Cat Beast, now in front of them. \nhe Cat Beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over.    The Cat Beast moves closer and closer. They are doomed. \nuddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound.   The Cat Beast turns, distracted. \nWe pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to be half ragdoll, half bird, with a bird-skull head swinging a weapon over its head.   THIS IS 7. 7 releases the weapon--a strap of leather with weighted shot at either end. The weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound and strikes the Cat Beast, entangling it. \n7, 5, and 9 now charge the Cat Beast. 5 shoots his crossbow, entangling the Beast's paw and hobbling it. 9 and 2 both LURE THE CAT BEAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, deliberately goading and further causing it to become entangled in the machinery.   7 now leaps up over the Beast and brings the full weight of her spear down on the Cat Beast's neck. The head of the Beast comes off and lands at their feet. now pulls off her bird-skull helmet. \nYou weren't lost-- \nYou've come back! \nI never left. YOU finally decided to join the fight. \nhe hands 5's map back to him. \n9 comes over with her shield (lost during the fight).    7 looks 9 over. \n7 (CONT'D) I think I know why. \nThey move towards her but she turns and looks at 9.     2 and 5 nod proudly towards 9. 7 nods. \nhey all look at the fallen Cat Beast. \n2 is poking at it: \nN \nRusty... hacked together... shoddy pile of scrap. \nThey all turn to leave. 5 and 7 support 2 on either side of him, helping 2 along.   9 hangs back to look at the machine again, and suddenly sees the TALISMAN, lying on the floor. \n5, 7, and 2 have continued on without him and do not see him as he picks it up. \nlooks at the strange object with ENORMOUS CURIOSITY. He turns it and see the RUNES on the side of it. He turns and inspects it closely.   He turns and discovers, on the machine, a PORT with the SAME RUNES. \n(blurting out) Look! \nThe others now turn to see him. They see him holding the talisman close to the machine's port... about to experimentally put the talisman INTO the port. \nNo!   Stop!       NO! \nT \nS \n(TO 9) The thing!       Show them. \n9 quickly sketches out a drawing of the TALISMAN and shows it to the twins. \n3 and 4 chatter, trying to analyze and catalogue the drawing of the Talisman. They shake their heads: they don't recognize it. \neeing it as a drawing, 5 is startled. \n5 (CONT'D) Wait! 6... he always draws that. used to keep the drawings... with his notes.... \n9 looks at 5. \nThe drawings... would they still be there? In 2's old workshop? \nYes. (slightly embarrassed) I saved everything. \nhen we'll go back.       Perhaps the answer is there. \n5 looks alarmed and looks over at 7.      7 shakes her head. \nI think the answer is there. \nShe points out towards the factory and strides off, dauntless, fine, and proud. The twins chatter unhappily, beaming flickering lights to each other. \n9 looks at 5.    5 nods and they set off in the other direction. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 120 - Winged Beast creation \nSEQ. 120 - INT. FABRICATION FACTORY - SAME TIME \nInside the factory, a very quick shot of the Fabrication Machine reaching its arms out and gathering things. It welds metal pieces. It grabs an enormous black-and-red Dictator's flag and rips it in half.   [  We do not see yet what it is creating.] \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 130 - Confrontation \nSEQ. 130 - INT. 2'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \n9 and 5 sneak into 2's workshop. A dirty moonlight filters through the air. 9's light is off. \n, familiar with the layout, locates 2's stash of 6's drawings. The pages are dotted with 2's annotations and drawings; he was obviously trying to figure out why 6 kept imagining this object and what it meant. \nand 9 bend over the drawings. They are unable to see clearly in the murky darkness. 9 looks around warily, then switches on his light. \nThe light now reveals 8 LOOMING IN THE SHADOWS. \n8 SEIZES them and escorts them out. \nSEQ. 130 - INT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - SAME TIME \n1, sitting on his throne, glares in righteous anger as 5 and 9 stand in front of him. You awakened what? \nHe gets onto his feet angrily. 6 hunches over one of his sketches, muttering to himself. 1 (CONT'D) You fools! I warned you! \n8 is sharpening his knife on the side. He warned you. \n9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window. \nHe opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should jump. \nThe others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of the bucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The Winged Beast plummets down the shaft after them. \nSEQ. 140 - EXT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - CONTINUOUS \nThe ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral's roof. \n9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6 to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and 9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the front of the Cathedral. 8 follows. S uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind them. It struggles to get through the window but can't quite fit. \n6 is very vulnerable out there. \n9 turns to 5. \nTake him inside. \nnow climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully. \nThe Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily.    1 and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed. Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them. \n8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet down over his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife and stands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beast to soar in closer... \nAnd then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and catches in the Beast's propeller. \nKnocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE. \nS \nJust as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on to the edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as he hangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING... \n9 catches up to where 1 is. \nSEQ. 140 - INT. CATHEDRAL - SAME TIME \n6 and 5 run down the banisters towards the crashed plane.     6 seems to pull 5 in a particular direction. \nEQ. 140 - EXT. CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS \nThe Winged Beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to shoot. 1 squints into the sun as the Winged Beast, backlit, swoops down towards them. He sees a glare come from the tin roof. 9 gets an idea.    He gestures to 1 to help him. 1 scowls, but has no alternative but to help him. \n9 peels back a piece of the roof, with 1 helping him.   The ROOF'S \nGLARE \nbeams right into the eyes of the Winged Beast, momentarily blinding it. T he Beast flinches just as it FIRES its harpoon tail at them. Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8. \nThe harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the Cathedral. \nSEQ. 145 - Wing \nSEQ. 145 - EXT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - CONTINUOUS \n8 falls onto and then slides down the harpoon's line, swinging into the Cathedral and landing on the wing of the airplane embedded in the side of the Cathedral, right next to 5 and 6. 8's weight on the harpoon's line has pulled it more and more taut... \nThe Winged Beast is pulled hard into the roof and slides down, knocking into 1 and 9. \n1 and 9 PLUNGE into the Cathedral and onto the plane wing, where 8 catches them in midair before they hit the wing. \nI \nShe RISES UP and points her sewing needles at 1... we see 8's limp body trapped in her belly. \nThe other ragdolls leap into action. \nchops off the tail and with it 2's carcass but then is thrown to the side and trapped as a cascade of books fall on her. \n9 manages to grab 1 who is partially sewn on to the seamstress but can't free him. \nThe seamstress lashes out towards them. \n5 fires an arrow and hits the Seamstress's eye, blinding her. She turns to flee, dragging 1 with her. 1 struggles in mortal terror. \nH \nA \n5 pulls the blade from 2's staff from his quiver and throws it to 9. 9 catches the blade and cuts the threads away from 1's body, trying to free him unsuccessfully as 1 struggles. \nt the very last moment, they manage TO CUT 1 LOOSE. But the seamstress suddenly darts one of her claws out, GRABS 7, and SLITHERS OFF out through the library [ALT: through part of a drainpipe in the bottom of the fountain] with 8 still attached to her belly and disappears. T he other ragdolls run after her but it is futile; she is gone. \n(HORRIFIED) No! No! \nSEQ. 168 - Burial and Regrouping \nSEQ. 168 - INT. LIBRARY/FOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS \nThe ragdolls stand in the bottom of the fountain, where remnants of water still linger, and water dribbles into the drainpipe at the bottom of the fountain [ALT: next to the fountain]. The coin in 1's crown falls to the ground. He sits down heavily. \nThe twins emerge, eyes wide. They've seen the whole thing. They look with alarm at everyone, and sadly, at 2's carcass. \nlooks in the direction of where the seamstress disappeared. \nI have to get her back!   I have to go after her! \nIt's too late. \ne has a strange, sad look on his face.    He looks in the same direction. \n(CONT'D) (SADLY) It killed 8... it'll kill her too. \nIt didn't kill him. (THINKING) (MORE) \nC \nT \nIt's taking (cont'd) to the 9 them back Machine. \nThe twins look up and nod their agreement. While the others have been talking, they have found a book cover and have lain 2's body on it.

He hands it to 9. \nINT. FACTORY - SAME TIME \n9 darts from hiding place to hiding place inside the darkened factory, moving towards the Fabrication Machine. \nHe spots the half-blinded Seamstress and watches in HORROR as he sees that the Seamstress is giving 8 up to the Fabrication Machine. 9 is too late to do anything to stop the Machine from sucking 8's soul. \nhere is a bright GREEN GLOW as 8's soul is sucked, and in the sudden illumination, 9 sees 7. She is sewn into the Seamstress--but is still alive! \nNGLE on 9 as he realizes she is still alive and he can still rescue her! From his hiding place he looks around for a way to rescue her. He inspects the machinery near him. He sees a LEVER and GEARS. He looks at his LIGHTSTAFF. He then spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged Beast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand out to drag the fabric towards him. \nNGLE on the Fabrication Machine as it begins to power back up after taking 8's soul. \nNGLE on the Seamstress. She turns to get 7, and give her to the Fabrication Machine. We see the TERROR and DEFIANT FURY in 7's eyes, but she is immobilized and can do nothing. \nSuddenly the Seamstress hears a SOUND.   She whips around. P OV through the Seamstress's damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the shadows. \nhe Seamstress, distracted from her morbid mission with 7, slithers towards the movement. \nIn the shadow we see a RAGDOLL with GLOWING EYES. 7 sees this and registers recognition, relief, and also TERROR at what will be 9's fate. But she is unable to move or speak and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers closer and closer to its prey. We see the misery on 7's face. \nThe seamstress raises her needles and STRIKES the ragdoll, sewing wildly. \nT \nT \nThe ragdoll SWINGS OUT from a string attached to a lever. The lever now moves down (because of the weight of the ragdoll) and SWITCHES on machinery. Gears start to turn and we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trapped seamstress in, arms first. \nhe gears CRUNCH the ragdoll. 7 FLINCHES... but then her expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is not a ragdoll at all but is 9'S LIGHT-STAFF DRESSED IN FABRIC. Instinctively, she looks up, a sudden hopeful look on her face... just as \n9 SWINGS IN and lands on the SEAMSTRESS, tearing a hole in her back. He slides down the length of her body, FREEING 7. \n7 and 9 fall to the ground as the gears now CRUSH THE SEAMSTRESS. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

We see they have built two paths of wooden boards leading down to the entrance of the coal chute, have dug a trench under the barrel, and have placed a long bar of metal beneath the barrel. \n(hoarse whisper) PULL! \nThey all pull down with all their weight. The barrel lifts and teeters, then tips and RACES DOWN THE HILL. At the bottom, it launches off the boards, spinning into the air and landing on the rails to the coal chute with a sparking crash. \nhe ragdolls race down after it. \nThe barrel rolls and comes to a stop right at the mouth of the coal chute. \nSEQ. 185 - Seeker Drone \nW \nSEQ. 185 - EXT.

They look with great affection and appreciation at each other. \nThe twins chatter: they've found an old Victrola lying in the debris, with an old warped record still on it. They climb onto the record, tripping the needle arm onto the disc, and begin walking on the record. \nA scratchy old melody comes from the large Victrola amplifying horn. 7 smiles at the sound of the music. She leaps on the record, joining them. As they walk faster, the music speeds up. \n1 comes up behind them. He looks deep in thought.     He catches his hat as it begins to slip off his head. \nH \nH \n1 goes to sit down and rest, sitting on a brick. 5 heads over towards the others.

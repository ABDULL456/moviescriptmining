From the Merchandise Mart, looking down the fetid, green swath of water. A boat is rolling up the man-made canyon. 
CAMERON (VO) Are you guys worried about nuclear war? 
FERRIS (VO) Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've won our freedom, we're traveling down one of American's most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war? 
SLOANE (VO) It is kind of raggy subject, Cam. 
CAMERON (VO) Regardless. It's with us every day. The possiblity of global destruction. 
SLOANE (VO) Don't you think it's an issue because people need something to worry about? They have to like, have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective? 
CAMERON (VO) Maybe. 
FERRIS They used to have Viet Nam. They used to have the oil crisis stuff and Iran. That's over and people have to have their big issue. It's not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon, you know. 
SLOANE (VO) To answer your question...No, I'm not worried about it at all. 
FERRIS (VO) We don't know when the bombs going off. We do know, however, that college starts in the fall.

FERRIS He's full of shit. All the old hippies are full of shit. 
SLOANE He says I don't care about things like he did. 
FERRIS What's he care about now? 
SLOANE Baldness, fatty meats and money. 
FERRIS I rest my case. 
CAMERON What's spooky is they still control everything. They took over when they were young and they never gave it up.

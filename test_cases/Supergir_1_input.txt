SELENA I'm ready for her. I'll show you. 
Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan. 
EXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY 
MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan. 
SELENA Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one. 
Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool. 
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL 
The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ETHAN Why the empty cage? 
SELENA That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. 
Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees. 
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL 
Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight. 
ETHAN What...? 
SELENA You don't get this far without paying...a certain price. 
She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan. 
MR. DANVERS If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her. 
MRS . DANVERS I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you. 
She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her. 
JIMMY (shyly) I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens. 
LUCY Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention. 
JIMMY You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time? 
LUCY You bet your ass. 
JIMMY Why didn't you tell me? 
LUCY You're supposed to guess. 
She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers. 
INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX 
Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses. 
SUPERGIRL Why are you stopping? 
ZALTAR Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn't do. 
He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand. 
ZALTAR Oh dear! 
The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards. 
ZALTAR The wand. Use it. 
Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion. 
ZALTAR Good girl! That's the way!

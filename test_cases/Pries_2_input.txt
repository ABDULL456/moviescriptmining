EXT. NIGHTSHADE RESERVATION - SAME TIME 
CRYPT FAMILIAR 
THE MASTERS ARE AWAKING 
BLACK SHAPES BURST from the crypt doorways SCREECHING as they fly into the air. Circling above the reservation like a nest of angry hornets. Disturbed. WHOOSH! One of the figures SWOOPS low, touching to the ground. Giving us our first good look at a vampire; Wet, white skin. Insect clicking claws. Black eyes. Fangs. More creature than human. The vampire cackles, sounds like dried paper, its voice a series of teeth clicking hisses. as it eyes Priest angrily. 
LEAD VAMPIRE What are you doing here,. Priest... haven't you already done enough? 
PRIEST We don't want a fight. We're just looking for the girl. The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're scraggly, a little undernourished. 
LEAD VAMPIRE Look at us -- Living in ruin, forced to feed off the blood of animals. We once scoured 'this land. We were warriors...we were Gods! 
PRIEST You were murderers. 
LEAD VAMPIRE We were what nature made us. (flashes his fangs) I recommend you leave immediately...You are not welcome here. 
ONE BLACK FIGURE still flies above. Like a vulture, it circles Hicks. Marking him. 
PRIEST We're not going anywhere until you tell us where she is. 
LEAD VAMPIRE Then you aren't going anywhere,. If there was a tumbleweed in the vicinity this is when it would blow by. A tense BEAT then. . .Priest pulls out a BLACK BOOK. 
PRIEST ,,Yea though r walk through the Valley Of The Shadow Of Death x will fear no Evil -- " The vampires laugh. Fangs glinting. 
LEAD VAMPIRE --'Your words mean nothing to us, Priest. And now we see the book's actually hollow on the inside, filled with dozens of .little STAR-METAL CROSSES. 
PRIEST 
1 - 6 (WHISPERS) Forgive me. in one quick motion Priest scoops a handful, snapping his 
WRIST AND 
THE CROSSES CUT through the air, heading straight for the BLACK FIGURE. S t SOUEAL.S as the metals; it like hot goals through 1 err tC erina it apart, the pieces raining' down around Hicks, crashing to the ground. And then all hell breaks loose. The Nightshade Vampires hiss. Bearing their fangs like cobras and taking to the air with a SHRIEK. Attacking. Frightened beyond shit-all-belief -- Hicks FIRES wildly, chasing the creatures with his gunfire. His bullets whistling harmlessly through the air. WHOOSH! A vampire swoops towards him, fangs bared, claws ready to rip. 
PRIEST 
Leaps at the creature just in time, driving it to the ground. in one brutal motion he. straddles it, twisting its head at a horrible angle. He turns to Hicks. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) 
FOCUS. And with that he's gone, rolling across the ground like a boulder and LEAPING at TWO DARTING VAMPIRES. 
HICKS Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy until finally all life drains away. 
HICKS (under his breath) Jesus. Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping. Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat. He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster. This leaves only 
THE LEAD VAMPIRE Perched atop his crypt like a gargoyle, raging at Priest and Hicks from the depths of hell with at HORRIBLE SHRIEK. In full fury, he LEAPS and flies away, the sounds of his torment echoing throughout the canyon as he vanishes into the night sky. 
HICKS (CONT'D) Should we go after him? 
PRIEST No need. He'll the at first light. Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground. They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of the neck. 
10 PRIEST (CONT'D) No more masters. Just you and me. He raises a knife, pressing it to the Familiar's skin. 
FAMILIAR (frightened beyond belief) -- The metal beast! She's in the metal beast! 
PRIEST Make 'sense.

{"test1_input": "As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree. As they struggle. \nMULDOON Strong legs. \nELLIE Lot of track in college. \nBACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - \nIN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around, trying to get comfortable to rest. \nLEX I'm hungry.  When can we get going? \nREGIS When the electricity comes back on, honey.  These cars run on electric cables buried in the road. \nIN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes. Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all. \nTIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around. He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the floor.  The kids look at him. \nREGIS Must be turning on the electricity. \nLex sits up, looks around groggily. \nLEX Feels like a vibration. \nINT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT \nThe T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after the other in long, powerful strides. \nBACK ON CRUISE RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER \nThere is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND, the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE. \nCAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles. \nTIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence. \nTim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up. \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand. \nThe T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence. \nIN THE SECOND CRUISER - \nGrant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness. \nCLOSE ON LEX - \nTears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear. Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it. \nREGIS Jesus Christ. \nLEX Bad language. \nREGIS Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't electrified. \nLEX Is that bad? \nRegis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex. \nRegis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex. \nRegis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him. \nTIM Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you going? \nLEX He just left us.  He just left us all alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone! \nFLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head. \nTIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser. \nTimmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car. \nIN THE SECOND CRUISER - \nGRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur ther, causing its electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings. \nTIMMY REACHES - \nout into the rain for the open door handle. \nAnother LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex? \nTimmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back. \nLex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth. \nThere is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie. \nGRANT (ON WALKIE) Timmy, be quiet. Don't move. \nBACK ON GRANT - \nHe snaps off the walkie-talkie. \n", "test1_true": "GENNARO Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do now? \nGRANT \nCan't think of a thing. \nThe T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser. \nBACK ON TIM - \nHe watches the beast move. \nBACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO - \nAs they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain. The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head, looking for movement inside. \nCLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket. \nGrant whispers, hardly moving his lips. \nGRANT Don't move. \nGennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably. \nIN THE FIRST CRUISER - \nVery frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off, distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic. \nLEX It's too, too dark out there. \nTim waves his hands in caution. \nBACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX - \nThe Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g rabs his walkie. \nGRANT (TO THE WALKIE) Shut that flashlight, Tim! \nAs the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car. \nON TIM - \nHe lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit. \nLEX No, it's mine.  Please, I need it. \nTim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up. Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him. Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast plainly for the first time and SCREAMS! \nThe POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side. \nAbove, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening. \nGRANT - \nwatches the Rex raise his mighty h ead again, above the kids' cruiser. \nTIMMY AND LEX - \nhave a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking. \nThe dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving, his forelimbs pawing the air. \nTimmy whispers to Lex. \nTIMMY Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move. \nLex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand. \nThe Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts, shards go flying. \nInside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other, and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS. \nThe whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees. \nThe cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex falls he lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex. \nTIMMY (softly) Lex?  Lex? \nSILENCE.  No movement from Lex. \nTHE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove sends the children flying again. \nThe cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment. The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground. \nINSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides. \nTHE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car. \nGRANT DANCES - \nwith a flare!  The Rex is distracted. \nCLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes. \nThe Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare. \n", "test1_id": 2829, "test2_input": "GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS: \nGENNARO Extinct animals should stay extinct! \nHe bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant, who stays frozen in place. \nGennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T- Rex jogging behind him. \nGennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM. \nINSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door. POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls. LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck' position. \nON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad door.  Pieces go flying. \nGennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around. \nGRANT RUNS BA CK - \nto check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car, sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard. \nLEX (OFF) Dr. Grant! \nGrant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks her for broken bones. \nGRANT Lex, are you okay? \nLEX Timmy's unconscious, he won't move. \nLex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight. The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser! \nThe Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him. He SCREAMS. \nLex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother. \nLEX Timmy! \nThe Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex. \nINSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the crushed roof and the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself. \nThe Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment. But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car. \nGrant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop! \nGrant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of the embankment. \nJust in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway out of the car, unable to get out further. \nGrant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly. \nGrant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall and swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and - \n- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as - \n- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS! \nGrant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree at the base of the wall. \nGrant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen. Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers. \nGRANT Let ... go ... please. \nThe Rex ROARS above.  They look up. \nTHE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING FLASHES. \nEXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS - \nNedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes. \nCLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel. \nNEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur s across the road. \nNedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring the careening jeep under control. \nThe jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and dives into a raging gully. \nNedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he cranes his head around, examining his situation. \nNEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors. \nNedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end. and wades over to an abandoned tractor. \nNEDRY Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes. \nHe loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli ghts. \nHOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE. \nNedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops, looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks. \nLooking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares. \nNEDRY I hope this is one of them herbivores. \n", "test2_true": "Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side - HOOT! \nNedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep, swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a demonic apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare of the headlights! \nCLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws. \nA big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off. \nNEDRY Gross. \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits. \nThis glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight. \nVERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated. They fire! \nThis glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS. \nNEDRY I'm blind, I'm blind. \nHe falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him. \nNedry pulls open the jeep door, thrusts his head in, slams it against the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it closes it on Nedry. \nNedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently turns his blind eyes that way. \nA long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES. \nINT  TIMMY'S CRUISER \nTimmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him \nTimmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet on the window frame and looks out the broken roof. \nTIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An o pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY! \nINT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION \nTim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a tree on the hillside. \nTIMMY Oh shit! \nTimmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand. \nCRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind. \nCRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet. \nTIMMY Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit! \nTimmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant. \nGRANT Timmy.  Are you ok? \nTIMMY Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex? \nGRANT Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down. \nTimmy nods. \nGrant peers throug h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy. \nGRANT Try the door you're leaning against. Nice and slow. \nTimmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The cruiser drops another foot. \nGrant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still. \nGrant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air. \nGRANT Crawl this way.  Slowly. \nCarefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down. He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si ts on a branch, a few feet below the cruiser. \nCRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air. \nGRANT We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy.  Okay? \nTimmy agrees. \nGRANT One, two, three, jump. \nTimmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's hurtling right at them. \nTimmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES them.  They scramble down as quick as they can. \nTimmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK! Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a half-step behind them. \nTimmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth with a THUD!  Grant CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it. \nGRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked headlight glaring. \nOil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles. The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground. \nGrant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing. \n", "test2_id": 2830, "test3_input": "GRANT It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at least ten miles to go.  If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress. \nTIMMY Let's do it. \nINT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING - \nGrant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators, empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables. \nGRANT Lex, I don't see any raft. \nTimmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know. \nTIMMY Keep going. \nGrant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe, piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall. \nGRANT Bullseye! \nTimmy is reliev ed.  Lex smiles. \nLEX Told you! \nGrant grabs them.  Looks around, still - \nGRANT No raft. Where did you see it, Lex? \nLEX Actually, I never really saw one. Just assumed. \nGRANT Assumed? \nShe nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking. \nIN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall on her, knocking her to the ground. \nLEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off. \nGrant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground. \nTIMMY Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay! \nLex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on. \nTIMM Y Look, Lex!  Look! \nShe looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs. \nGRANT I'm afraid there's no raft. \nGrant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it - the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles.. \nAT THE RIVER'S EDGE - \nGrant pulls a cord. \nWith a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft. \nTimmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and pushes off with his oars. \nThe small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks. \nGrant surveys the river. \nGRANT Looks pretty calm. \nTHUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard. She reaches in about elbow deep. \nGrant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water. \nA general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream. \nA WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER - \nGrant energetically works the oars. \nCLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water. \nLEX I'll row, Dr. Grant. \nGRANT No. \nBut he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her hand in the water.  It still trails. \nLEX Hey, we're still moving. \nGrant looks into the water.  She's right. \nGRANT There's a current. \nGrant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two kids look at him. \nLEX You can't sleep. \nGRANT (eyes closed) I'm not sl eeping... yet. \nLEX I'll do it! \n", "test3_true": "TIMMY We gotta warn them about the boat. \nGrant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current. \nA BEND IN THE RIVER - \nCurrent picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR. \nTIMMY Cool! \nWhite foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes. \nANOTHER BEND - \nNow the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave. \nThe raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant. \nTIMMY Thought is looked calm? \nGRANT Guess I was wrong. \nGrant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly. \nLex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and again.  Her face is serious. \nLEX I can't swim! \nGrant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings. He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the rubber grips. \nGRANT Hold on real tight. \nThey go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens. \nThe raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way. \nJagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging trees. \nGrant looks ahead.  He blanches. \nHIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall. \nThey're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently, heaving over the magnificent precipice. \nTimmy tries to tighten L ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS: \nTIMMY Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go. \nThe raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around. \nThe rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge. \nAt the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade. With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let his hands smash into the overhanging branch. \nThey stop right at the waterfall's edge. \nGrant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps rushing.  His strength ebbs. \nTIMMY Don't let go! \nGrant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip. \nThe rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft. Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet. \nTIMMY You can do it! \nGRANT I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! .... \nHis hands slipping, slipping ... \nGRANT No!!!!! \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud. \nINT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON \nArnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor. \nMULDOON Son-of-a-bitch.

That's a very valuable animal. \nMULDOON I know it's a valuable animal. \nMuldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over. \nWU What's that, John? \nWu points to the screen behind Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!

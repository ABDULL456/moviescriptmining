{"train": "JURASSIC PARK \nJURASSIC PARK \nFirst Draft by MICHAEL CRICHTON \nRe-write by MARIA SCOTCH MARMO \nEXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns. \nMOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt, hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the different surfaces of the stones. \nCAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER, abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is folded on its back. \nSLOW MOTION as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body. \nA SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along. arriving under a long-lensed microscope. \nIN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately removes a fragment of tissue. \nPINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen. \nTHE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a neutral mist. \nWASH OUT TO: \nHOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY - \nEXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON \nLodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI NG PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs, scribbling notes, and conferring with each other. \nThe center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard. \nGrant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone. A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence. \nCLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it. \nGrant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly. \nGRANT Right calcaneus of an adult female raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's this tell me? \nStudents look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues. \nGRANT It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid. \nOFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him. \nELLIE (off) Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant! \nGrant looks up. \nDR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of dust behind her. \nShe zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her. \nSTUDENT Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking! \nDr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues. \nGRANT So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress fractures in the heel ... \nUncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it. \nELLIE She jumps. \nGrant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to - they knew is all along. \nGRANT Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she jump? \nNo answer.  Ellie gives it a try. \nELLIE A defensive posture against a vicious, blood-thirsty T-Rex? \nGRANT (nodding) Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young? \nEllie jumps up. \nELLIE I bet is was a mating ritual. \nStudents laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie. \nGRANT The science of paleontology can't answer these questions.  Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations.  What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet. Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice. \nEllie intrudes again. \nELLIE Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is, we're late.  There's the car. \nShe points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a dusty wake. \nGrant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags. \nGRANT Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches.  Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys. \nGrant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage. \nROS S What does he say? \nGENNARO Insists nothing's wrong on the island. \nROSS You know him.  Do you believe him? \nGENNARO No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with him five years ago when we raised the capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's unpredictable, a dreamer. \nROSS Potentially dangerous.  We should never have gotten involved.  What's our position? \nGENNARO The firm owns five percent. \nROSS General or limited? \nGENNARO General. \nROSS We should have never done that. \nGENNARO It seemed wise at the time.  We all wanted the park to happen.  It was in lieu of fees. \nROSS \nIn any case, I agree an inspection is overdue.  Who are your site experts? \nGennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out. \nROSS Will they tell the truth? \nGENNARO I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot in his field, always goes his own way - \nROSS - Good.  You're making all the arrangements? \nGENNARO Hammond asked to place the calls himself. I think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble.  That it's just a social invitation, showing off the island. \nROSS All right ... Good.  But let's be very clear about one thing.  I don't know how bad this situation actually is, Donald. But if there's a problem on that island - don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn Jurassic Park to the ground. \nGennaro shakes hands awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed- up, he whispers to himself. \nROSS Costa Rica, my ass. \nHe whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning. \nCAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a helicopter and DISSOLVE TO: \nINT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN \nOn the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar. \nINSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row. \nGrant loses himself, looking out the window. \nGRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air. Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds. \nThere is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the window. There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the island below them eerily fits right into her doodling. \nPILOT That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the descent is a little hairy. \nGennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way. \nELLIE This is exciting! \nGRANT What is, Ellie?  Where are we going? \nGrant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply \nGRANT Looks like Alcatraz. \nThe pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand. \nPILOT There's bad wind shear on this peak. \nGrant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt. \nEllie smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled. \nELLIE How the hell is he landing this thing? \nNo answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion. \nELLIE This is not fun. \nGrant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross. \nGRANT Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe. \nThe copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand. Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut. \nGRANT Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing, Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you! \nAnother violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back. \nCLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a packet of crackers. \nGennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened. He speaks a mantra. \nA CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS. \nINT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY \nCLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight. Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly. \nGrant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis, Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building. \nThe Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so, exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies. \nGRANT \nWhere's Hammond? \nREGIS Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys. \nGrant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently. \nGENNARO Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks. \nRegis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside. \nGrant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant. \nELLIE The audicity of man to get here at the last second and think he runs the show. \nGrant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop. \nNedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change .  It doesn't work.  He SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute. Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits. \nTHE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies are scattered all around. \nRegis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles. \nAt that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically. A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system. \nVOICE (ON P.A.) Please come to the theater.  In a moment, our film will begin. \nThe voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages. Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He climbs the stairs to the second floor. \nINT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY \nSmall and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and Ellie sit further behind. Gennaro stands in the back and smokes. \nCELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion. overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production. \nyears young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group. \nHAMMOND Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions.  Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago.  When our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations. \nToday, the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions:  the headlong and furious haste to un ravel the mystery of genetic engineering has become more than just a subject for science fiction writers. \nON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie. \nGRANT - the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. \nBACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject. \nHAMMOND Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history.  It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman.  Why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment. \nON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again. \nGRANT Here we go. \nBACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes. \nHAMMOND \nNothing will ever be the same again. It's literally going to change the face of our planet as we know it. \nMUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen descends behind him. \nHAMMOND ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is made possible through the miracle of DNA replication, commonly known as cloning. To explain what cloning means, I'm going to need my own clone - John Hammond. \nAnother Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one. \n2ND HAMMOND Hi, John! \nHAMMOND Hi, John. \nIN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles. \nBACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone. \nHAMMOND Okay John, hold out your finger. \n2ND HAMMOND Why? \nHAMMOND I need some of your genetic material. \n2ND HAMMOND Now just a minute here, John. \nHAMMOND Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body.  You have a hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a couple. \nHammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with a thorn. \nHAMMOND Dinosaurs. (superbly proud) I've been cloning dinosaurs! \nCAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face. \nHammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale model of the entire resort. \nHAMMOND Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not a resort, not a scien tific conservatory, just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting. \nHammond grins with delight. \nGENNARO At least every rich child. \nGrant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in. \nCAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river. \nHAMMOND Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! 238 fabulous creatures so far! \nTIMMY Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want to just kill each other? \nHammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up. \nHAMMOND Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. There are monitors every hundred feet whatever we could plant them on the island.  A computer to tabulate it all. \nELLIE You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the right to do that? \nHAMMOND I didn't create them.  I found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber. \nGRANT We don't have the science.  There's no source of dinosaur DNA. \nHammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly. \nHAMMOND Yes ... there is. \nINT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY \nHammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them. \nThey go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up with an x-ray-like image of his hand and each door HISSES open. \nCLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath: \nHAMMOND Glitches. \nHammond tries again. \nINT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nThe door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room. In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow. \nNedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him, typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN. \nHammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the ringmaster. \nHAMMOND And this is the right side of my brain. The entire park is safely controlled from here.  John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m aster control operator. (with genuine concern) John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me. \nARNOLD Oh, you'd survive just fine without me. \nArnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at Hammond, who ignores him. \nHAMMOND Everything's controlled from here. Remote everything. Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this.  We run this place with twenty workers.  This computer does it all.  And it polices each and every single animal out there. \nELLIE (whispers to Grant) Who polices the computer? \nHammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large video screen faces this chair. \nHAMMOND That's where I will watch the astonished watchers.  Okay, let's go. \nThey practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again. \nNEDRY Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond. \nARNOLD Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible. \nNEDRY Right. \nBACK ON HALLWAY - \nHammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked: CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm. \nTIMMY That stuff turns you into a mutant! \nHe contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in Lex pulls on his pocket. \nHAMMOND Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal precautions. \nGennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in. \nHAMMOND My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and Timmy's someday. \nINT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION \nGrant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares. \nGrant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged and numbered. \nLEX Come look! \nHere, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles. \nHammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time. \nWU This is the incubation room.  We keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a relative humidity of one hundred percent. \nGRANT AND TIMMY Jurassic atmosphere. \nTimmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy. \nWU We also run a high oxygen concentration, up to thirty-three percent, so if you feel faint, please tell me right away. \nLex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward, waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch. \nLEX I'm ... melting! \nEllie laughs and pulls Lex close. \nWU Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all.  The embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment. \nGRANT That's why you create the mist. \nWu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big eggs they hold. \nWU Children, please do not touch!  The eggs are permeable to skin oils. \nGrant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it. \nGRANT What kind of eggs are these?  Are these shells plastic? \nWU Yes, they are,  The embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room.  But we've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process - these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they're contained in when they're born.  Like real births. \nThey reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall, beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward. \nWU Eggs that are determined viable spend their last couple days in our specially- designed incubators, which help accelerate the pre-natal developmental stages.  Which is interesting becaus e we're having a problem with the adult animals - \nHammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs. \nHAMMOND There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle. Now who wants to see the real thing? \nAs they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs. \nEXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY \nBlue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of the Visitor's Center. \nGrant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants. \nGENNARO ... so naturally, Hammond's going to present everything in the best light.  I need to know that this park is safe. \nELLIE I'll tell you something that troubles me from the start.  The carnivores are all well-fed and kept separated from their \nnatural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive, but it won't keep 'em happy. \nGENNARO How do you mean? \nELLIE The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's an instinct.  And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed. \nFURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously. \nHAMMOND Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have no affection for that type of thinking. \nGRANT Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own judgments. \nAt the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball. \nEXT  TOUR START - DAY \nThe group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them. Regis leans out of the first one. \nREGIS Hey!  Great day for a tour! \nGENNARO Looks like rain to me. \nREGIS No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off till we got back. \nThe kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top. \nGrant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car. \nHAMMOND Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now. \nThe cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves. \nGennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves. \nHAMMOND Gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you. \nIn the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant. \nGENNARO Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's damn guinea pigs? \nGRANT I like to wait and see. \nALL THREE Dilophosaurus! \nTimmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a gentle but restraining arm. \nPRE-RECORDED VOICE Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest carnivores.  Scientists once thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill, but now, through the miracle of their cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom, a poison which causes blindness and then unconsciousness. \nTheir distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air. \nGENNARO Poisonous d inosaurs, there's a liability issue without a lot of precedent. \nCLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide. \nGRANT (assessing) It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's a poison ... \nELLIE Spitter! \nThe Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light. \nELLIE Are we dreaming all this? \nEXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY \nA big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH. \nMuldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle. Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle. He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there. \nMULDOON These raptors are too damn dangerous. One of them tunneled out this morning.  He ripped a boy's arm off before I could get a bullet in him. \nHAMMOND A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I have five left? \nMULDOON John, they're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps.  Their little fingers make them natural cage-breakers.  We should terminate the raptor program.  They're just too smart.  Too damn smart. \nHAMMOND Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally. They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them properly? \nHammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all. \nMULDOON John, remember back in '88, when we started to build the containment devices? \nWe ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns that blow out electric nets.  They're all too slow for these guys. If we're going to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles and laser-guided devices. \nHammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back. \nHAMMOND It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors - after my guests leave, okay? \nHammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER. \nMULDOON Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence. And wear your rifle when you're working! \nINT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON \nHammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing. \nHAMMOND Wh ere are they?  Punch 'em up. \nARNOLD They'll be by the trike's in a moment. Trike's sick again. \nHAMMOND How can you say it so matter-of-factly? The trike's.  You casually accept it, but I never can.  You know what it means when you say \"by the trikes\"?  \"By the trike's\" means that they're out there by the species:  triceratops horridus.  It astounds me every time what I've done here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur. I will never be complacent about that. \nArnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice and some chatter of the kids. \nEAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring. The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock. \nRADIO \nHello, John.  This is the Anne B at the dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns just south of us.  Requesting permission to leave before unloading the last three food containers. \nNedry looks up quickly, listening carefully. \nRADIO Don't want to be stuck here if this chop gets much worse. \nHammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up. \nNEDRY Coffee anyone? \nHe's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone. \nHAMMOND Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you tonight?  I certainly don't want to imperil anyone.  But can you give us one more container of food?  Then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return.  Could you help us out here?  Of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor. \nRADIO Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll get one more container off. How's that? \nHammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds. \nINT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The first car comes to a jerky stop. \nThere is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly, breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight. \nBefore the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie. \nGrant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN. She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal. \nLEX I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick. \nVET We don't know what's wrong with Freda. Every six we eks she gets like this. \nREGIS (TO WALKIE) You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to come here in the evening and just sit. \nGRANT (OVER WALKIE) Where is the T- Rex? \nREGIS (TO WALKIE) Good question. \nON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land. \nGRANT Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs. \nOVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio. \nREGIS (OVER WALKIE) Would if she could, believe me.  Some- times she stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, and wiggles those little forearms of hers in frustration. But the T-Rex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences. Believe me, she can't go anywhere. \nGRANT Then where is she? \nThey hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively. \nThe tour group stares out their windows, expectantly. \nBACK ON CONTRO L ROOM - \nHammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group. Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over. \nMULDOON Just checking in.  Everything ok? \nHAMMOND Look at them.  Leaning out the windows, so eager.  They can't wait to see it. They have come for the danger. \nMULDOON That's what I'm afraid of. \nMuldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers. \nBACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - \nGrant watches quietly. \nThe BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking. \nLEX What's going to happen to the goat?  Is the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat? \nGrant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently. \nGRANT He's here. \nThe goat is tethered in the middle of the fi eld, thirty yards from the nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex. \nThe goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its bars surround the goat with safety once again. \nREGIS Looks like the Rex will have its snack a little later today. \nRECORDED VOICE The sensors don't see the Rex around. She usually comes within five minutes of hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that means she's sleeping - we might have access to her at the picnic area. \nLex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone. \nLEX I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I liked the goat. \nBACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM - \nHammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro. Their voices are heard in the control room. \nGENNARO (MONITOR ED) What is a carnivore got out? \nGRANT (MONITORED) There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct. \nHammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen. \nHAMMOND Damn those people.  They are so negative. \nARNOLD It's natural.  They can't fully appreciate that we've engineered the animals and the park for total safety. \nHAMMOND They comb this island like a bunch of accountants.  They don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all. \nARNOLD You can't make people experience wonder. \nHammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park. The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection. \nAt his console, Nedry looks at Hamm ond.  Hammond stares out the window. The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold without turning. \nHAMMOND It's like the Garden of Eden out there. This is the most beautiful time of day. \nARNOLD Better rout the tour back.  They can start again sun-up tomorrow morning. \nHAMMOND Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be hungry when they get in. \nArnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry. \nNEDRY Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the lines to upload some data. \nHammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles. \nNEDRY I'll clear a couple of lines for you at the end of the next transmission, sir. Here you go now, this will make it all better, Mr. Hammond. \nNedry punches in a code. \nCLOSE ON - Nedry's fat finger punching a last key. \nARNOLD That's not the worst of it. \nHAMMOND Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out? \nWu smashes through the door. \nWU All the security doors are open.  Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed. \nThe camera pushes in on Hammond's face. \nHAMMOND Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he? Did anybody check the damn john? \nHammond storms out. \nINT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION \nHammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells: \nMULDOON John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut the power? \nHAMMOND Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring back the tour right away.  I don't need any of this! \nMuldoon is already running back the way he came. \nINT  GARAGE - NIGHT \nSeveral electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters. \nTo the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side of the front seat is a rocket launcher. \nNedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens. Approaching FOOTSTEPS. \nNEDRY Oh, shit! \nINT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER - \nMuldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete. \nBACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps. Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With everything he's got, he lifts the incub ator waist-height.  And holds it. \nBACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop. \nCLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught. \nBACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll down his brow. \nMULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going. \nNedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height. \nCLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. \nNERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales. \nAt that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage. \nNEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule. Nedry's frightened face. \nMULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol. \nNEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher, and zooms into the night. \nA moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his face straining to understand. \nEXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT \nNedry's red jeep flies down the park road. \nCLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it. \nHis tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill. \nNedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts! \nTwo safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another, and another.  It f its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door. \nNedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool. \nCLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate. \nHe races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning. \nHe grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open. \nNedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams. He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates move recklessly in the stormy night. \nBACK ON GARAGE \nEllie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding jumps out of the jeep. \nMULDOON Get out, get out!  I need this jeep. There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie, Hammond'll fill you in. \nEllie is concerned, the n decisive. \nELLIE No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon. \nAs Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree. As they struggle. \nMULDOON Strong legs. \nELLIE Lot of track in college. \nBACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - \nIN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around, trying to get comfortable to rest. \nLEX I'm hungry.  When can we get going? \nREGIS When the electricity comes back on, honey.  These cars run on electric cables buried in the road. \nIN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes. Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all. \nTIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around. He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the floor.  The kids look at him. \nREGIS Must be turning on the electricity. \nLex sits up, looks around groggily. \nLEX Feels like a vibration. \nINT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT \nThe T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after the other in long, powerful strides. \nBACK ON CRUISE RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER \nThere is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND, the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE. \nCAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles. \nTIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence. \nTim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up. \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand. \nThe T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence. \nIN THE SECOND CRUISER - \nGrant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness. \nCLOSE ON LEX - \nTears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear. Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it. \nREGIS Jesus Christ. \nLEX Bad language. \nREGIS Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't electrified. \nLEX Is that bad? \nRegis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex. \nRegis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex. \nRegis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him. \nTIM Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you going? \nLEX He just left us.  He just left us all alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone! \nFLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head. \nTIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser. \nTimmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car. \nIN THE SECOND CRUISER - \nGRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur ther, causing its electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings. \nTIMMY REACHES - \nout into the rain for the open door handle. \nAnother LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex? \nTimmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back. \nLex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth. \nThere is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie. \nGRANT (ON WALKIE) Timmy, be quiet. Don't move. \nBACK ON GRANT - \nHe snaps off the walkie-talkie. \nGENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS: \nGENNARO Extinct animals should stay extinct! \nHe bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant, who stays frozen in place. \nGennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T- Rex jogging behind him. \nGennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM. \nINSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door. POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls. LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck' position. \nON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad door.  Pieces go flying. \nGennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around. \nGRANT RUNS BA CK - \nto check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car, sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard. \nLEX (OFF) Dr. Grant! \nGrant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks her for broken bones. \nGRANT Lex, are you okay? \nLEX Timmy's unconscious, he won't move. \nLex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight. The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser! \nThe Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him. He SCREAMS. \nLex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother. \nLEX Timmy! \nThe Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex. \nINSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the crushed roof and the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself. \nThe Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment. But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car. \nGrant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop! \nGrant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of the embankment. \nJust in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway out of the car, unable to get out further. \nGrant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly. \nGrant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall and swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and - \n- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as - \n- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS! \nGrant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree at the base of the wall. \nGrant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen. Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers. \nGRANT Let ... go ... please. \nThe Rex ROARS above.  They look up. \nTHE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING FLASHES. \nEXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS - \nNedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes. \nCLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel. \nNEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur s across the road. \nNedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring the careening jeep under control. \nThe jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and dives into a raging gully. \nNedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he cranes his head around, examining his situation. \nNEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors. \nNedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end. and wades over to an abandoned tractor. \nNEDRY Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes. \nHe loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli ghts. \nHOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE. \nNedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops, looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks. \nLooking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares. \nNEDRY I hope this is one of them herbivores. \nTIMMY Thanks, Dr. Grant. \nGRANT You owe me one. \nGrant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest. \nGRANT Where'd Lex go? \nThey hear a faint WHIMPERING. \nTIMMY There's Lex. \nHe runs.  Grant follows. \nINT  DRAINPIPE - \nLex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her mouth and she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS. \nON THE HILLSIDE - \nGrant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex. \nGRANT Come on out now, Lex. \nLex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again. \nTIMMY It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex. \nShe shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look. \nTIMMY I found your baseball. \nLEX You did? \nBut she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly. \nGRANT Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there. And tight.  Why don't you come out? \nLEX I'm afraid of the \"animals\". \nTIMMY The \"animals\" are gone. \nLEX Where did it go? \nTIMMY I don't kno w but it's not here now. \nLEX Are there any grownups out there? \nGRANT I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go. \nLEX I'm hungry. \nGRANT Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back to civilization. \nEXT  ROADSIDE \nRegis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck. \nHe touches his cheek. \nCLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly, he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and pulls out another.  He SCREAMS. \nAs soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward him. \nREGIS Noooooo! \nBACK ON HILLSIDE - \nGrant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far. \nTIMMY What's going on? \nGrant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a tree, unmoving. \nGrant whispers to the kids. \nGRANT It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see him.  Evidently, he can only see move- ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still. \nAFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree. \nGRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast. \nREGIS \nYou don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off! \nTHE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off. \nGrant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids. \nGRANT Let's go! \nGrant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run. \nBACK ON  TOUR REST AREA - \nARNOLD It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that fat bastard left for himself.  When he hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of commands that turned the whole goddamn park off.  Hammond was right about him. \nWU If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure Nedry did.  You're find it. \nArnold nods grimly. \nINT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT \nHammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles. \nMuldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness. \nMULDOON We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured. Harding's tending to him in your quarters.  He'll be all right if we can \nradio for help.  Your grandchildren and Grant are somewhere in the park.  I believe they're alive but I don't know where they are. \nHAMMOND I'm sure you'll find them. \nMULDOON I certainly hope so. \nHAMMOND I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep telling everyone, this park is made for children. \nMULDOON Just so you understand that they're missing, sir. \nHAMMOND Missing?  Of course I know they're missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob, let's not get carried away.  We've had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've had a regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And that's all that happened.  We're dealing with it.  Arnold will get the computers cleaned up, and the radio and phone lines open.  You'll find those kids and my good friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want some of this ice cream.  It's very good. \nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nDark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch. Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles. \nGENNARO That Rex didn't even give me his full attention.  That's what hurts.  I was just an afterthought.  I gave him my full attention. \nHARDING He's had a lot of morphine. \nGENNARO (sings) Not enough. \nELLIE I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few tests in his lab. \nHARDING He's probably in the control room, get- ting in the way while Arnold tries to put things together. \nAs Ellie leaves, Genna ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor. \nGENNARO Yo ho, I'll close this place down ... \nEXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT \nThe ship is tossed around on a stormy sea. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT  STATEROOM - \nThe eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a silvery line runs down its side. \nEXT  PARK - NIGHT \nSomewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk. \nLEX I'm tired. \nTIMMY You're too big to be carried. \nLEX But I'm tired-tired. \nGRANT Okay, Lex. \nGrant picks her up. \nGRANT Oof!  You're heavy. \nThe full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond .  Grant is lost is thought, trying to decide where to go. \nGRANT I think we're still in his paddock. \nLex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder. \nGRANT What? \nLEX Don't you see?  Don't you see? \nGRANT What? \nLEX The fence. \nGRANT (squinting) No. \nTIMMY Oh I do, right there! \nLex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile. \nThe kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps. \nLEX Timmy's scared of heights. \nTimmy spins in fury. \nARNOLD Right.  And it does something else. It erases the code lines that refer to it.  It destroys all evidence it was ever there. \nMULDOON Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and reset the whole show.  No one would ever miss him. \nARNOLD Watch this. \nArnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park. \nARNOLD Hot damn! \nMULDOON Are the fences back on? \nARNOLD You bet they are.  It will take a few seconds to get up to full power, because we've got fift y miles of fence out there, and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way.  But in a half a minute we'll be back in business. \nArnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges through the fences. \nMULDOON Motion sensors? \nARNOLD Got them too.   It will be a few minutes while the computer counts.  Then I'll tell you where Grant and the kids are and you can go and get them.  But every- thing's working.  Half past ten and we've got the whole thing back up and running. \nMuldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head. \nMULDOON Just hiss. \nBACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE - \nGrant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and continues to sleep. \nIn the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the f ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops. \nIN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on. \nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM - \nThe glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it. \nMULDOON What is taking so damn long?  Where are they? \nARNOLD There's a lot of extraneous movement out there.  Branches blowing, birds, back- ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay, count's finished. \nMuldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down. \nARNOLD Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're out of range of a sensor. \nMULDOON Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I wish I could go out there   But I haven't got anything to use on the Rex.  My rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry stole.  And going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide \nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT \nBrightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn. \nELLIE Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu? I'm just going to run a couple more tests and then I'm going to turn in myself. \nWu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool. \nWU No point in everyone being exhausted. \nHe starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie. \nWU I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as soon as there is light. \nEllie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN \nBeautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean. \nINT  STATEROOM, ANNE B \nEggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves. CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn. \nEXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN \nMuldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS travel with him.  Each carries a rifle. \nEXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN \nCAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS. \nGrant and Timmy wake up with a start. \nTHEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at his shoe. \nThe hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids press tightly into Grant. \nLEX He gonna eat us? \nGRANT I don't think so.  She's a ... \nGRANT AND TIMMY ... herbivore. \nGRANT What is it? \nLEX I hear something. \nGRANT Come on. \nTimmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another. \nLEX Hear it now? \nTIMMY You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta get back and warn them about the boat. \nLex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw een Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it. \nHONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry. \nTIMMY What's going on? \nGRANT They're agitated. \nThe duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the young ones to protect them. \nWith a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away straight toward the hadrosaurs. \nLEX I told you I heard something! \nThe earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids. \nGRANT Outta the way, kids! Run! \nGrant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like a football.  Timmy runs beside them. \nHadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant hears the crashing of trees. He takes a glance over his shoulder. \nGRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM. \nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM - \nThe quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive presence affects all in the room. \nArnold looks at his illuminated watch. \nARNOLD Memory should be cleared by now. \nHe pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on. \nARNOLD Damn. \nArnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow. \nELLIE What's wrong? \nARNOLD Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches back on before I restart the power. \nArnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers. Holding his breath, he turns on the main power switch. \nFirst, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly. \nARNOLD Thank God! \nThe room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone. \nELLIE Arnold!  They're still not working. \nARNOLD No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually. \nArnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns. \nWU (to Hammond) Arnold's about to get the phones up. \nArnold pushes the chair back. \nARNOLD Okay, we're up again! \nEllie grabs the phone back up. \nELLIE No we're not.  Phones still dead. \nArnold swings her way. \nARNOLD Can't be - \nHAMMOND My God, look at this, Arnold. \nHammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl. \nELLIE What's happening? \nARNOLD (tonelessly) The duckbills. \nWU My good God. \nELLIE What? \nARNOLD It's the Rex ... \nGRANT It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at least ten miles to go.  If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress. \nTIMMY Let's do it. \nINT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING - \nGrant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators, empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables. \nGRANT Lex, I don't see any raft. \nTimmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know. \nTIMMY Keep going. \nGrant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe, piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall. \nGRANT Bullseye! \nTimmy is reliev ed.  Lex smiles. \nLEX Told you! \nGrant grabs them.  Looks around, still - \nGRANT No raft. Where did you see it, Lex? \nLEX Actually, I never really saw one. Just assumed. \nGRANT Assumed? \nShe nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking. \nIN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall on her, knocking her to the ground. \nLEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off. \nGrant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground. \nTIMMY Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay! \nLex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on. \nTIMM Y Look, Lex!  Look! \nShe looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs. \nGRANT I'm afraid there's no raft. \nGrant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it - the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles.. \nAT THE RIVER'S EDGE - \nGrant pulls a cord. \nWith a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft. \nTimmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and pushes off with his oars. \nThe small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks. \nGrant surveys the river. \nGRANT Looks pretty calm. \nTHUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard. She reaches in about elbow deep. \nGrant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water. \nA general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream. \nA WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER - \nGrant energetically works the oars. \nCLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water. \nLEX I'll row, Dr. Grant. \nGRANT No. \nBut he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her hand in the water.  It still trails. \nLEX Hey, we're still moving. \nGrant looks into the water.  She's right. \nGRANT There's a current. \nGrant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two kids look at him. \nLEX You can't sleep. \nGRANT (eyes closed) I'm not sl eeping... yet. \nLEX I'll do it! \nARNOLD I'm not. \nWU Looks like you are. \nARNOLD Can't be. \nWU Print the system status log. \nArnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off. \nEllie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES. \nHammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up. \nThe room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes. Hammond ROARS above the chaos. \nHAMMOND What the hell is going on? \nOnscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches. At zero, the lights go off, the monitors, even the computer.  Just the alarms keep screaming. \nHAMMOND You're ruining my ordered, precise park! \nArnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS. \nHAMMOND Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it! \nArnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground. Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest. \nArnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren: \nARNOLD I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but I'm going to put it all back together for you - I promise.  I will \nBACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL - \nGrant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs. \nThe ROAR of the water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle. Nothing. \nGrant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft, the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them, various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered by rushing white water. \nLEX The waterfall stopped. \nTIMMY Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop. \nGRANT I think they cut the power.  Hey - \nHe points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist is the visitor's center. \nGRANT Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go, kids. \nThey grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore. \nBACK ON CON TROL ROOM - \nMuldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is alternate patches of bright and dark. \nIn a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible. \nHAMMOND Told him, fix my park, fix my park. \nWu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm: \nWU You shut down as six thirty-four this morning, and when you started back up, it was with auxiliary power. \nARNOLD Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up first and then that's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge.  The main generator has to be manually reset. \nWU Outside?  In the generator building? \nArnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout: \n06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER \nMULDOON This doesn't mean the fences have been off since six-thirty, does it? \nArnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down. \nARNOLD Backup power doesn't generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences, so they were automatically kept off. That's also why we had no phones or radio. \nMULDOON All of the fences? \nARNOLD Yes. \nMULDOON Including the velociraptor mesh? \nARNOLD (disgusted, exhausted) Yes, yes, yes. \nIn the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a sitting position. \nHAMMOND Do you mean those raptor s could be loose? \nARNOLD I'm afraid so. \nMULDOON No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two days to chew through that mesh.  But give 'em enough time, they'll get out.  We better get that power on now. \nHAMMOND Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure there' five of them there. \nLEX Are they going to be ok? \nGRANT If we can get help very soon. \nTIMMY Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking. \nHe studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN. \nBACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - \nThe raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below. In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset. \nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM - \nTimmy tries somethin g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her. \nGRANT (TO RADIO) Ellie, we're working as fast as we can here. \nTimmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP. \nTimmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button. \nThe screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL SYSTEMS NORMAL. \nBACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - \nThe raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as the current flows through him.  He can't get out. \nFinally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below. \nEllie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock. \nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM - \nGrant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops. \nELLIE (ON RADIO) Ok, we're all right here for now. \nThanks. \nGRANT (TO RADIO) Don't mention it.  It was Timmy. \nELLIE (ON RADIO) But there's still one more raptor.  So be careful. \nTimmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now. COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants. \nHe indicates the radio-mike to Grant. \nTIM I think this is the boat.  They called it the Queen Anne or something. \nGrant grabs the mike. \nGRANT Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne? \nThe radio crackles to life. \nRADIO This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy. What's up? \nGRANT Report your position! \nRADIO Ah, we're just about to dock here in Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please identify yourself. \nTim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F REDERICK D. (CAPT.) Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails. \nGRANT Try this for identification, Captain Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen biological materials.  If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. Do you copy? \nSILENCE. \nGRANT Do you copy, Captain Farrell? \nRADIO I copy.  All ahead stern. \nA blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact. \nTIMMY What's the Uniform Maritime Code? \nGRANT Who the hell knows? \nGrant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts. \nLEX What good does that do?  To have the ship turn around? \nGrant turns to her seriously. \nGRANT Well it gives us ten more hours. (to Timmy) Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing. \nThe last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway. \nINT ROTUNDA - \nWith the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time. \nThe raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat behind, and his snar ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases. \nThe kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred, closing the gap on the kids. \n", "test1_input": "She SPLASHES into the stream. \nTimmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water. \nThe baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath. \nTimmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water. The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike. \nGRANT Go home now.  Home to Freda! \nLEX Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride him.  He could carry me instead of you, Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay, \nGrant shakes his head, \nGRANT Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here! \nThe trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is heartbroken. \nLEX Will I ever play with him again? \nGrant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning. He has to keep them going.   He points across the field. \nGRANT We gotta get to that motion detector. It's still a ways. \nLex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the water's edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back while the adults watch indulgently. \nEXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING \nMuldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to track the different groups. \nA BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground. \nA BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he scatters them. \nMuldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it. When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING. \nMULDOON I found Nedry! \nIn the distance, the call is ECHOED. \nBEARDED WORKE R (OFF) I found him! \nBALD WORKER (OFF) Found him! \nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY \nHammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles. \nHAMMOND He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park.  It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up. \nGennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro enthusiastically agrees with a nod. \nHAMMOND You really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle.  The park is actually quite safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu, all loyal employees, are righting damage \nas we speak. \nGENNARO Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's more than we ever dreamed!  Those brachiosaurs are so big!  And those Spitters - (he spits) - incredible!  I only have one problem. Aren't we going to have pterodactyls? (he frowns, smacks his forehead) Oh, they'd fly away! \nGennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away. Hammond takes out a bag. \nHAMMOND Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you seen these?  These are great. \nHammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park. \nHAMMOND Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas. \nGennaro is thrilled. \nHAMMOND I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur bingo, hey ... \nHammond leans closer. \nHAMMOND Wu says he can make a foot high \ntriceratops.  We'll sell pets as living souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only food we sell, of course. \nGennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly. \nHarding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder. \nHARDING You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond. He's doped to infinity and back. \nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY \nSunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands. She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open. \nX-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA. \nEllie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X- ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again. \nThe viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there. \nWU Who gave you permission - \nEllie attacks back. \n", "test1_true": "WU That's absurd. \nELLIE These bones aren't fully formed. \nWU You're qualified to interpret x-rays of living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took me many months to learn. \nY I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't an adult, just a huge juvenile. \nWU You're making a lot of assumptions here. \nELLIE Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu? \nThey stare at each other in the bright sunlight. \nHAMMOND (OFF) Growth hormones. \nThe two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room. \nWU She didn't have a right to explore my lab. \nHAMMOND Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious problem. (to Ellie) These animals don't last.  There is a regularity, a predictability about when they die.  It's always ... very young. We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure Wu will figure it out.  It's just ... \nWU Just some adjustment in the code is required. \nHAMMOND But there are deadlines.  The park opens next summer. And it requires full-grown specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time.  But they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it. \nEllie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot behind him that his appearance is like an apparition. \nHAMMOND I was going to tell you all this myself, Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped breathing down my neck.  That's why I wanted you and Dr. Grant here on my island - you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help me? \nCUT TO: \nIN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds - \nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY \nEllie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands. \nEllie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed. She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in. \nShe brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood. \nINT CONTROL - DAY \nArnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder. Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up. \nELLIE Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. He needs transfusions.  We gotta get a rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with the phones? \nARNOLD Ah hell. I just can't find it. \nHe sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen. \nELLIE Find what? \nARNOLD Nedry jammed all the communication lines. He inserted some command, a lockout into the program code.  I can't find it, because I gave that restore command and it erased part of the program listings. \nWU So?  Just reset - shut the system down and you'll clear the memory.  Everything will be in the normal wakeup mode. \nARNOLD Shut the system down? \nWU And reset. \nARNOLD I've never done that before.  And I'm reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr ue, all systems will come on, but maybe they won't. \nELLIE Look, there is a sick man here who needs medical attention or he'll die.  Four people are out there, missing in your park.  We need search teams.  We have to have a phone or radio. \nArnold still hesitates. \nELLIE Well? \nARNOLD Well, it's just that the safety systems don't function with the computer shut down and - \nEllie boils over. \nELLIE - turn the goddamn safety systems off! Can't you get it through your head that we have no choice? \nArnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without turning, Hammond nods his consent. \nARNOLD Okay. \nArnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. He pops them off, one after another. \nARNOLD You asked for it.  And you got it. \nHe throws the master switch. \nThe control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and Ellie stand in the dark. \nELLIE How long do we have to wait? \nARNOLD Thirty seconds. \nEXT  FIELD IN THE PARK - \nGrant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops. \n", "test2_input": "Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju red man to safety. \nMULDOON You ok? \nIn reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was. \nWU Now, there's four. \nMuldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in and join them. \nEllie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS: \nELLIE I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door after I go in.  Wu, guide me! \nMuldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may be their best plan. \nEllie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and graceful.  She ducks into the generator building. \nAbove it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window. \nBACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE \nThe three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense face is a river of sweat. \nINT  GE NERATOR BUILDING - \nEllie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall. Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a pipe.  She rubs her head. \nELLIE Damn, I banged my head. \nWU (OVER RADIO) Oh that's good, that must be the water pipe.  You're really close now, there's a cabinet just above your head.  Reach up and open it.  The handle turns to the left. \nEllie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens. \nWU (OVER RADIO) It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down, count to three, and push it back up. That's all there is to it. \nEllie throws it down.  She counts: \nELLIE One - \nBACK ON GRANT AND KIDS - \nJust a few feet from the bottom of the fence. \nBACK ON ELLIE - \nELLIE Two - \nBACK ON GRANT AND KIDS - \nGrant and Timmy jump down. Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in the fence pattern.  She pulls on it. \nBACK ON ELLIE - \nELLIE Three! \nShe throws the large switch back. \nBACK ON LEX - \nShe jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground. \nCAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape. \nGrant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe. NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES! \nThe Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated. \nLEX We did it! \nTIM We made it! \nLex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy. \nBACK ON ELLIE - \nThe siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground. She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils. \nIt's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth. \nSMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down from above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on. \nEllie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it. The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall. \nEllie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push against the wall, begins to climb up. \nThe raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned. \nEllie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and banging against pipes, she races toward the door. \nEXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION \nEllie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters. Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie. Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn. \nELLIE Raptor! \n", "test2_true": "Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload. \nThe raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate. He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on. \nEllie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges. \nMuldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a second, it doesn't move. \nEllie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu. \nELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu. \nWU Keep it open!  I'm coming! \nWu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically. Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck , equally close to the open door. \nELLIE Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run! \nThe raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door. \nELLIE They're coming inside! \nWU Help! \nWu and the raptor are at the door. \nMULDOON No they're not, Ellie. \nMuldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are horrific. \nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION \nEllie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her. \nMULDOON I couldn't compromise everyone's safety. \nEllie nods, catches her breath. \nELLIE Why didn't the power go on? \nMULDOON You just reset the power.  Now the computer has to be booted. \nMuldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do or. \nMULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters. \nCAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down. \nINT  VISITOR'S CENTER - \nGrant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and quiet.  They call out but there are no answers. \nLEX Where did everybody go? \nGrant thinks. \nGRANT Probably your grandfather's quarters. Let's go. \nA DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders. \nGRANT Actually, stay here. \nHe corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop. \nLEX No, I want to stay with you. \nGrant looks around tensely. \nGRANT No, keep an eye on things round here for me.  I'll be back with the others. \nTIMMY What about - \nGrant looks at Timmy. \nGRANT I'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now. Don't move from here ... unless you have to, ok? \nTimmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor. \nLEX Goody!  I'm gonna rest. \nShe finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it walking to Timmy. \nTIMMY Tired!  He carried you the whole way. \nGrant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back. \nGRANT Be right back. \nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - \nIt's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him. Scared Workers huddle together, many a re injured.  Hammond sits on the floor, in a meditative trance. \nEllie and Muldoon stare out the window. \nTHEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building. \n", "test3_input": "Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully. \nELLIE Why don't you just nail that bastard? \nMULDOON No more ammo.  I requisitioned six charges but the bean-counter - (he thrusts a finger at Hammond) - cut it down to two. \nEllie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun. \nEXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY \nThe ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight. \nINT  STATEROOM - \nThe cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the remaining eggs. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It bands against the  the wall again and again. \nTimmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex. \nLEX Any candy behind the counter? \nTIMMY Hungry? \nLEX Starved. \nTimmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out. \nTIMMY Nothing. \nLEX Let's go to the kitchen. \nShe smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure. \nTIMMY Dr. Grant said - \nLEX - let's go.  We'll come right back. \nCLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too. \nHe makes the right decision. \nTIMMY Nope.  We're waiting here t ill Dr. Grant gets back.  He'll help us get some - \nInterrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal. \nLex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills spinning to a stop. \nThe breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM. \nIt's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat. \nTimmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy grabs another, whispers as he winds it. \nTIMMY Start winding now! \nLex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th em across the hall.  The raptor leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one. \nThe kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant. \nLEX Where are we going? \nTIM The kitchen! \nINT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - \nWith a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS. \nThe raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon. \nELLIE How long? \nMULDOON Well, they seem to be getting faster all the time. I would say - fifteen minutes. \nEllie no tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the gate.  She hammers on the glass. \nGrant's hand reaches for the knob. \nThe raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up. \nEllie screams and screams. \nGrant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter. Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the fence, grabs it, puts it on. \nEllie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it. \nELLIE There's a raptor on the roof of this building.  Open that gate and you're a dead man. \nGrant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand to the glass. \nGRANT Ellie, I'm go glad - \nELLIE Shut up and listen.  We have about fifteen minutes here.  The computer has to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the electric fences.  Besides the r aptor stuck in here with us, there are four more ... \n", "test3_true": "INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION \nThe kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables, crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind. \nRelentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their shortcuts, it just continues around. \nTimmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her. \nTIMMY We'll freeze to death in there. \nLEX He's going to eat us! \nTimmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile of steaks.  He tosses one toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer. \nThe raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait. \nTim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's. \nTIMMY PUSH! \nThe heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve but they do not give. \nThe kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment, Timmy is back on his feet. \nLEX What is it, Timmy? \nTIMMY I just remembered something.  Rapto rs are born in large litters.  There's probably more coming.  We gotta hide. \nHe grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen. There's a stairway and they race up. \nINT  GIFT SHOP - \nGrant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above and begins to run. \nINT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER - \nThe kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into - \nINT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - \nThe kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room. \nINT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY - \nAutomated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground. \nINT  GENETICS ROOM - \nThe Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and magnetic tape as the kids race by. \nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - \nThe kids slide int o this room.  They race to its far corner, past incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see - \nKID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time. \nCLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children. \nHe begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go. \nThe raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his younger sister. \nCLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like. \nAt the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He comes out with a syringe and a vial. \nThe raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children. \nGrant speaks into the headset. \nGRANT (TO RADIO) Talk, Ellie, just keep talking. \nHe tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The raptor studies it, transfixed. \nGrant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it up, swallowing it whole. \nThe raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them, tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD. \nThe kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run. \nGRANT Timmy, you know anything about computers? \nTIMMY Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told my Dad I wanted a 386. \nGRANT Ok good, you're elected. \nINT  CONTROL ROOM - \nGrant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into his headset. \nGRANT (TO RADIO) Okay, we've reached the computer room. Who can te ll Timmy how to reboot? \nELLIE (OVER RADIO) Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot the computer.  Please hurry, we've only got a couple minutes left. \nGRANT Tim, you got to book the system.  They reset the power and there are no phones. We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship. \n"}

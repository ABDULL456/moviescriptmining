SCOTTIE I'm starving. And I'm thirsty.          I want a soda. 
He takes Scottie by the hand and sits her down in a chair next to the bed. 
MATT We're not leaving until you talk to her. I'll even give you privacy. Recite her the alphabet for all I care. What do you want to drink? 
SCOTTIE Sprite. 
MATT OK, Sprite. Diet Sprite? 
SCOTTIE Not diet.    Regular.   Do you think I'm fat?

MATT No, you're not fat. 
SCOTTIE I'm not the model. 
MATT It's just that all that sugar makes you cranky. 
SCOTTIE I'm not cranky! 
MATT Okay.     I'll be right back.    Talk.

As Matt steps out into the hallway, he passes NURSE JOY. 
NURSE JOY Mr. King, how are you? 
MATT Fine, Joy, fine.     And you? 
NURSE JOY I see your picture in the paper today. Have you made your decision yet? 
MATT My decision? 
NURSE JOY Your family. About your big land. 
The other NURSE nudges Joy to be more polite. 
NURSE JOY (CONT'D) What?     Me and Mr. King, we're like this. 
MATT Well, it's not really my decision. It's my whole family's decision. And furthermore... (mock scolding) ... mind your own business, young lady. 
As he turns away to continue down the hall --

MATT (V.O) (CONT'D) The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s. My cousins and I meet in six days to approve a buyer. Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards. Why does so much have to depend on me -- my wife, my daughters, my family's land? I just want to hide. 
11   INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP - DAY                                            11 
A POSTCARD shows a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL in a bikini straddling a surfboard, laughing as she's splashed. 
Barely containing his rage, Matt stares at postcard before grabbing ALL THE POSTCARDS in that rack. 
AT THE COUNTER -- 
About to pay for the postcards and two SODAS, Matt notices a HEADLINE atop a stack of NEWSPAPERS: "Activists Continue Protest of Kaua'i Sale." 
SHOPKEEPER Hey, they all the same cards.      You like buy all the same cards? 
MATT These are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop. This girl is underage. Why do you sell postcards like this? This is a hospital. These aren't get-well cards. 
The SHOPKEEPER blinks at the man weirdly accosting her. 
SHOPKEEPER You like buy all the cards?       Or you want I put them back? 
MATT (pulling out his wallet) Never mind. Yes, I'm buying them.          And these two sodas. 
As she rings him up --

SHOPKEEPER Okay, you buy underage girl all for yourself. 
In the lobby just outside the store, he drops the stack of postcards into the GARBAGE. 
12   INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - DAY                                        12 
Forgoing the elevator -- perhaps to squeeze in a little exercise -- Matt trudges upstairs.

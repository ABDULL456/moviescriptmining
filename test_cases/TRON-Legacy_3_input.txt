Patrols of X-Takks pass. 
Rush leaps to a vantage point them. Scouts a route, signals Flynn, Krod, Boole, Quantz and the Code Monkeys. 
Fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the BLAZING FIREWALL. It's like a sheet of molten lead, pouring endlessly before them. A lethal barrier. 
FLYNN This is all yours, Rush. 
Rush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under the molten data flow. He struggles against raw power, disk HEATS UP WHITE, splashing aside the molten data. 
FLYNN Go!    Quick! 
Code Monkeys, Flynn and Krod, Quantz and Boole dive between Rush's legs, emerging on the other side. Barrier overcome. 
Rush leaps out of the firewall, clutching his white-hot disk. 
RUSH No sweat. (to himself) OUCH. 
CODE MONK N1J That way to the portal! 
RUSH Let's do it. 
118   CONTINUED: 
They head for the fortress along a surreptitious route, avoiding X-Takk patrols. 
119   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
Plexor - with Mega and the Cybavors two paces behind - leads an army of X-Takks. 
A Cybavor growls at Mega.          She growls back. 
MEGA There it is.     That's the portal. 
Plexor masses his forces around a closed ENCRYPTION PORTAL. It is a dark semispheric aperture, left unlocked (but closed). 
PLEXOR Converge on all levels! Outside patrols close in behind these coordinates! 
X-Takks come from all directions, all levels. 
120   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
Flynn pauses to see X-Net Patrols in motion, across bridges, through tunnels. All around. 
FLYNN Something's up. 
RUSH Keep moving. 
They come to a dark encryption portal, seen from their exterior view. 
BOOLE Portal 4786324BXY.       This is it. 
Flynn withdraws the HOLOGON. 
FLYNN The sooner Rush gets this into the main power supply, the sooner X-Net shuts down. And the more of us come out of here to tell about it. 
Rush takes the hologon, stows it. 
Pumped looks between Code Monkeys, Boole and Quantz.           Krod trembles. 
120   CONTINUED: 
KROD Oh man, I think I'm leaking. 
RUSH Krod.   You'll do great. 
KROD Think so? 
RUSH Your recognize patterns better than any of us. You'll know Plexor's moves before he does. 
KROD I hope you're right...     Rush? 
RUSH Yeah man? 
KROD Are you really a "User"? Is there such a thing? Is that what makes you so good? 
All Programs hang on Rush's answer.         Flynn too. 
RUSH Flynn and I come from a realm no better or worse than here... One thing I know, neither place works unless you're looking out for the other guy. And we've got a word for what all of you are. 
BOOLE Obsolete? 
RUSH Heroes. 
KROD Cool. 
CODE MONK B3T I'm ready. 
QUANTZ Let's do it. 
Fighters hustle under the shadow of the portal...        Approaching the closed semispheric aperture. 
121   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
X-Takks stand thick, weapons pointed at the closed aperture. 
Plexor marks time.    Cybavors poise to attack. 
Mega, emotions rising, takes a step back. 
122   EXT.   DARK PORTAL 
Flynn falters on his wounded leg.     Fighters steady him.

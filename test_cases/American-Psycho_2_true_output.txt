BATEMAN But wait, Harold, what do you mean? 
Carnes isn't really listening. 
CARNES Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers? 
He turns to go. 
BATEMAN Carnes? Wait. 
CARNES (Sighing) Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer. 
BATEMAN What are you talking about? Bateman is what? 
CARNES Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her? 
Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing couple. He laughs politely. 
CARNES Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must... 
BATEMAN (Desperate, shouting) Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true. 
CARNES Excuse me. I really must he going. 
BATEMAN No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer. 
Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance. 
BATEMAN Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer 
CARNES But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. 
BATEMAN It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? 
CARNES (Eyeing Bateman worriedly) It's just not. 
BATEMAN Why not, you stupid bastard? 
Carnes stares at him. 
CARNES Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago. 
BATEMAN No, you...didn't? 
CARNES Now, if you'll excuse me. 
Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze. They are all looking at the television, where Ronald Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's lying. 
PRICE How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit? 
VAN PATTEN What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere. 
PRICE (To Bateman) I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous. 
McDERMOTT He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless. Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, what can I say? 
PRICE I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it? 
VAN PATTEN Some guys are just born cool, I guess. 
Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look. 
PRICE And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about? 
BATEMAN I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN (To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now? 
McDERMOTT Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water? 
PRICE Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless Old codger. But inside... 
Pause. 
PRICE But inside...

ANN (pause) Next train in'nt for two hours. 
They walk on away from the station.  In the b.g. we see the stationmaster.  He and Ann wave.  They walk past the shingle for Doc Wilson. 
ANN (CONT'D) So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill represents...the wheel of fate is that too... 
JOE No, no.  Of course, that's exactly what it represents. 
ANN That whole... 
They walk on together and find themselves on a residential street. 
EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DUSK 
They are walking.  They stop in front of an old picket fence with a porch swing. 
JOE The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday things... 
ANN Everyday things...yes. 
JOE For example, he's just come back from a fire and he...um... (he shakes his head) That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there. 
ANN I live there. 
JOE Really.  With the porch swing and everything... 
ANN Surest thing you know. 
PAUSE 
JOE I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might... 
ANN That's what the swing is there fore... 
They walk onto the porch and sit on the swing. 
JOE (to himself) ...that's what the swing is there fore...that its purpose, isn't it... 
ANN ...I always thought so... 
They swing back and forth.  The swing creaks. 
JOE ...such a pleasant sound. 
ANN Mmm. 
JOE Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple things that... 
ANN Yes... 
JOE ...that. 
Doug walks up. 
DOUG Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some News for you... 
ANN Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac... 
JOE Sa pleasure. 
DOUG Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination to State Senate...which is this close to one stop from Congress! 
ANN ...who...? 
JOE Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting... 
ANN Mister White is... 
Doug, as he takes Ann toward the door. 
DOUG Nice meeting you...they were, let me tell you, they were a bit coy at first, I told them: Look: the people are tired, they're going to vote their pocketbook, yes, but... 
Joe walks off and exchanges glances with Ann, who lingers behind.  She pushes the porch swing and exits.  As it swings, Joe watches. 
INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 
Joe enters with his bag.  He stands looking at the long poster reading: "Waterford, Home of the Huskies - Division Champions - 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1976." 
BEAT.  Joe is looking at the banner when the old stationmaster enters. 
JOE What happened in 1973? 
BEAT.  The stationmaster looks around, and leans in to Joe, confidentially. 
The DOOR opens.  It is Walt.  The stationmaster retreats. Walt comes forward. 
WALT Don't run off.  Don't run off, we need you.  You know why?  You're why we're here.  Your script is why we're here... (of bag) Gimme that.  Big deal.  We fight a little bit? You show me a family that doesn't.  But we got something special.  What is it? We're here to make a movie.  Can't use the Old Mill.  Well, that happens.  What you got to do, you find the essence - what was it, that brought us here.  It wasn't a building, Joe, it was an idea. It was an essence - what is the essence of your story?  Joe? 
PAUSE 
JOE It's about a man who gets a second chance. 
WALT Then, you write that.  And then this is our second chance.  That's why we're here. 
PAUSE 
JOE I want to make a good film.

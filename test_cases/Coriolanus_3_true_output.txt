VOLUMNIA You might have been enough the man you are, With striving less to be so! 
CORIOLANUS Let them hang! 
VOLUMNIA Av, and burn too! Her outraged fury matches his. Overpowers his. 
MENENIUS 
(TO CORIOLANUS) Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough. You must return and mend it. Coriolanus turns away. 
VOLUMNIA Pray, be counseled. I have a heart as little apt as yours, But yet a brain that leads my use of 
ANGER To better vantage. 
MENENIUS Well said, noble woman! 
CORIOLANUS What must I do? 
MENENIUS Return to the Tribunes. 
CORIOLANUS Well, what then? What then? 
MENENIUS Repent what you have spoke. 
CORIOLANUS For them? I cannot do it to the gods. Must I then do it to them? 
VOLUMNIA You are too absolute, Though therein you can never be too noble. 
CORIOLANUS (upset, walking away) Why force you this? She pursues him: 
VOLUMNIA Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people, not by your own instruction, Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, But with such words that are but 
REHEARSED IN Your tongue, though but bastards and 
SYLLABLES Of no allowance to your bosom's truth... She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of seduction. 
VOLUMNIA I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake 
REQUIRED I should do so in honor... She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently, like a lover. 
VOLUMNIA I am in this your wife, your son, These senators, the nobles And you. A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web. 
VOLUMNIA I prithee now, my son, Go and say to them Thou art their soldier, and being bred in 
BROILS Has not the soft way In asking their good loves; but thou wilt 
FRAME Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs. 
MENENIUS This but done, even as she speaks, Why their hearts were yours. 
VOLUMNIA Prithee now, Go, and be ruled... (laughing to him) Although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower. Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them. Cominius enters with several other political supporters. 
COMINIUS Sir, it is fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence. All's in anger.

LORI No! Oh my god! 
JOHN Tell me when you get it! 
LORI AAAA, I got some on my thumb! 
JOHN AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed! 
LORI Shit! 
JOHN I'll get the next one, okay? 
INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - DAY 
TED She's makin' you do it, isn't she? JOHN (giving up the bullshit) Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time! 
TED What about... thunder buddies for life, Johnny? 
JOHN I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted. 
TED (SIGH) I know you do, Johnny. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise. 
TED And we'll hang out a lot, right? 
JOHN Fuck, all the time. 
TED (arms wide for a hug) Bring it over here. 
John hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying "I wuv you." John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably. TED (CONT'D) JOHN That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know- that doesn't mean-- I'm not - gay. 
JOHN We've got to get you a job. 
EXT./ ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME 
John and Ted head toward the store. Ted is dressed in a coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable. 
TED I look stupid. 
JOHN No, you don't. You look dapper. 
TED I look like Snuggles' accountant. 
They pause as John straightens Ted's tie. 
JOHN Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment. 
TED I don't wanna work at a grocery store. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN Well, you have no skills. 
TED I told you, I can totally be a lawyer. 
JOHN As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school. 
TED I'm a special case. I'm a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs," but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance I'm turnin' in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case. 
JOHN Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after. 
John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed. 
TED And if I don't get the job will we still smoke that pot? 
JOHN Probably, yes. 
TED (patting John on the leg) Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach. 
INT. GROCERY STORE MANAGER'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER 
Ted sits opposite FRANK, the grocery store manager. We see his name and title on a desk nameplate. Frank sits at the desk, staring at Ted. 
FRANK So. You think you got what it takes? 
TED Nope. 
FRANK (a beat, then) No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Shit. 
EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON

Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters crawling on the floor.  Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of groceries sit on the counter.  There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator. 
ANNIE Alvy, now don't panic.  Please. 
ALVY Look, I told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house. 
ANNIE Stop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There. 
The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden paddle, tries to shove them onto it. 
ALVY Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad. 
ANNIE Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake. 
ALVY If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up. 
ANNIE Oh, all right.  All right!  It's all right.  Here. 
She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly. 
ALVY Don't give it to me.  Don't! 
ANNIE (Hysterically) Oooh!  Here!  Here! 
ALVY (Pointing) Look!  Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator.  It'll turn up in our bed at night. (They move over to the refrigerator; Alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly dangles a lobster in front of him) Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus! 
ANNIE (Laughing, to the lobster) Get him! 
ALVY (Laughing) Talk to him.  You speak shellfish! (He moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water) Hey, look ... put it in the pot. 
ANNIE (Laughing) I can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I can't put a live thing in hot water. 
ALVY (Overlapping) Gimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies? 
Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on. 
ANNIE (Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) Oh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now he'll think- (She screams) Aaaah!  Okay. 
ALVY (Overlapping Annie) Okay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot! 
ANNIE All right.  All right.  All right. 
She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall. 
ALVY Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator.  I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean? 
ANNIE (Overlapping) Yeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna get my camera. 
ALVY You know, I-I think ... if I could pry this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs.  They don't run around. 
Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink. Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him. 
ANNIE Great!  Great! (Screaming) Goddammit! (Screaming) Ooooh!  These are ... p-p-p-pick this lobster up.  Hold it, please! 
ALVY All right!  All right!  All right!  All right!  Whatta yuh mean?  Are yuh gonna take pictures now? 
ANNIE It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely! 
ALVY (Picking up the lobster Annie placed on the counter earlier) All right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting! 
Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and making a face. 
ANNIE Don't be a jerk.  One more, Alvy, please, one more picture. (Reluctantly Alvy picks up the lobster again as Annie takes another picture) Oh, oh, good, good! 
EXT. OCEAN FRONT-DUSK. 
The camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore. 
ALVY So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what ... (He clears his throat) Am I your first big romance? 
ANNIE Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh.  No. 
ALVY Well, then, w-who was? 
ANNIE Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School. 
CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK OF DENNIS LEANING AGAINST A CAR - NIGHT 
Behind him is a movie theater with "MARILYN MONROE, 'MISFITS' " on the marquee. He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the frame.  They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling. 
ALVY'S VOICE (Off screen) Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night. 
ANNIE'S VOICE Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.

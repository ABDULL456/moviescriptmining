Go back before it's too late! \nSARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the corridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER FACE. \nFACE 2: Turn back while you still can!! \nSARAH turns and runs back the way she came. \nSARAH: Hoggle! \n23\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY \nHOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face. SARAH comes rushing toward him. \nSARAH: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here! They were horrible ... \nHOGGLE: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya? \nHe shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came from. \nHOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya haven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle. \nSARAH quickly follows. \nSARAH: False Alarms? \n24\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY \nThe corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their routine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight. \nFACE 1: This is the path of no return! \nFACE 2: Beware! Beware! \nHOGGLE: Just ignore 'em. \nSARAH: Are you sure? \nHOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE. \nFACE 3: Abandon all hope ... \nHOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya? \nSARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE's defiance. \nFACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part! \nHOGGLE: All right. But don't expect us to pay any attention. \nFACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this ... Abandon all hope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!! \nHOGGLE (bored): Very nice ... \nSARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along. \nFACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you're doomed, doomed! \n25\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY \nHOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor. \n", "test1_true": "SARAH (shrugging): Whatever. All I'm interested in is getting my brother back from that creep. \nShe starts to look around for something. \nHOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beat Jareth. \nSARAH picks up a rock. \nSARAH: Well, maybe I'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth business. \nShe takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor. \nSARAH: See, now I'll know which way we came in case I get lost. \nHOGGLE (sighs): Missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer the course around here, what ya want to do is go forward. \nSARAH: Look, Hoggle! I've got to find Freddie and I don't need you to discourage me! \nHOGGLE: And I don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around in circles with you! \nSARAH: That's fine with me! (she starts off) I know you're only after my ring, anyway! \nShe turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossing his face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious little creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of the floor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces it with the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE. \nBRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property! \nHOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes back into its hole. \n26\tEXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAY \nThe WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along. She thinks she's going forward but she's heading right for HOGGLE. \n27\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY \nSARAH emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with HOGGLE. \nSARAH: But ... \nShe whirls around to look behind her, then back at HOGGLE again. \nSARAH: ... but you were just behind me! I'm sure of it! \nHOGGLE shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor. \nSARAH: My mark! It was right here! \nHOGGLE comes up beside her. \nHOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things aren't what they appear to be around here ... \nJARETH (VO): Except when they are. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gasp with surprise and fear. \nJARETH: We meet again ... Sarah. \nSARAH: Where's Freddie?!! What have you done with him!? \nShe starts to rush toward JARETH but HOGGLE holds her back. \nJARETH: Nothing ... yet. \nHe walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looks down at HOGGLE. \n", "test1_id": 1170, "test2_input": "JARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I've definitely got something better in mind! \nHOGGLE: Don't you hurt her! \nHOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back down into the water. \nJARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_. \nHe grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water. \nJARETH: You can be with me or against me. \nHOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do? \nJARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ... \nHe leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE's face. \nJARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me. \nHOGGLE: Never! I'd rather die! \nJARETH sneers scornfully. \nJARETH: Then so you shall. \nHe drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight. HOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering. \nHOGGLE: Wait! \nJARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of amusement on his face. \nHOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you'll do to her! \nHe splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water. \nJARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ... \nHe reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach. \nJARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this. \nHe tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the water starts to recede. \nJARETH: You've made a very wise decision. \nHe leaves, followed by the GOBLINS. \nHOGGLE: I didn't decide nuthin'! \nHOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and he is sitting on cold, damp ground. \n48\tEXT: FOREST - DAY \nThe WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along but they couldn't care less. \nSARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle? \nWILD THING 1: Oh, did you say \"the castle\"? \nWILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle! \nWILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle! \nWILD THING 1: Rassle! That's a _wild_ idea! \n", "test2_true": "SARAH: OK, guys, fun's over. \nShe starts to leave and they pull her back. \nWILD THING 2: Over! It's just begun! \nAnd then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than ever. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they aren't hurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do is start throwing their heads at each other and switching them. \nWILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the background WE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off. \nWISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also verandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an antechamber or foyer ... \nHAT: Why me?!! \nThe door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness and is just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads and cries out in relief. \nSARAH: Ludo! \nLUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle? \nSARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!! \nLUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reaches its target and calmly tosses it into the trees. \nWILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! That's a little _too_ wild ... \nBut there's no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the other heads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after their heads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free. \nSARAH: Oh, Ludo! I'm so glad you're here! \nShe gives him a kiss and he beams. \nSARAH: Where's Hoggle? \nLUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door. \nSARAH: We've got to find him! Do you think we can? \nLUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE. \nLUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ... \nHe ambles off with SARAH following. \nLUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ... \n49\tINT: HOLE - DAY \nHOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly LUDO's head appears above. \nLUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet. \nHOGGLE almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged. \nHOGGLE: Ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a thinkin' creature! \nSARAH appears from behind LUDO. \nSARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won't get you out. \nHOGGLE's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten. \n", "test2_id": 1171, "test3_input": "HOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER works behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down. \nHOGGLE: Another! \nThe BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure off his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours. \n66\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT \nDIDYMUS and LUDO approach the red tent. They spy the JUNK WOMAN. \nDIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way? \nJUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin' in a place like this? \nDIDYMUS: She's on a rescue mission ... \nThe JUNK WOMAN finds this hilarious. \nJUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! You're in the wrong place, for sure! The only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our worldly goods! \nShe takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for emphasis. \n67\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out hopefully. \nSARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me! \nThe door opens and the JUNK WOMAN peers inside. \nJUNK WOMAN: Don't worry, Dearie. I sent 'im away! \nSARAH groans. \nJUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for no rescue mission. \nSARAH: Oh my god! Freddie! \nJUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that nice teddy? \nSARAH struggles for the door in the sea of junk. \nSARAH: No! He's my brother! And I've got to save him! \nShe continues pushing through the junk. \nJUNK WOMAN: No you don't, Dearie. You can stay right 'ere with all your pretty fings ... \nSARAH knows what her choice has to be. \nSARAH: I know I can. (joyous) But I don't want to! \nShe lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in the doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly. \nSARAH: Now get out of my way! \n68\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT \nSARAH runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face. \nThe JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to SARAH. \nJUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this! \nShe holds out SARAH's music box, opens it, and the little DANCER twirls inside. \n", "test3_true": "And she is off. As SARAH goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the JUNK WOMAN. And we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had just seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very different. Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a cross-section of her, with JARETH inside. His head is beneath the pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. He is the puppeteer operating the JUNK LADY, as indeed, she has been operated. JARETH is mad. \nJARETH: Damn. \n69\tEXT: CASTLE GATE - NIGHT \nLUDO and DIDYMUS sit forlornly at the gate. SARAH appears out of the night. \nDIDYMUS: My lady! \nLUDO leaps to his feet. \nLUDO: Sarah ... safe! \nSARAH rushes into his arms. \nDIDYMUS: Is Hoggle not with you? \nSARAH pulls away from LUDO. \nSARAH: Hoggle made his choice, he's ... not part of the mission anymore. \nDIDYMUS (angry): The coward! \nLUDO: Hoggle ... good! \nSARAH shrugs, and smiles at him. \nSARAH: Maybe. But there's no time to discuss it. We've got a baby to rescue, remember! \nShe leads them through the gates. \n70\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT \nStreets full of hovels encircle the castle. This is where the GOBLINS live. As SARAH, LUDO and HOGGLE walk through the dark, eerie streets they are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of lights. \nDIDYMUS: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady. \nA CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway. A FEMALE GOBLIN sees him and drags him inside and slams the door. \nSARAH (grimly): Methinks you're right! \n71\tINT: TAVERN - NIGHT \nHOGGLE is still at it. He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE that the only treasure left is SARAH's plastic circlet. He slowly pulls it off and stares at it. The BARTENDER approaches, his eyes lighting up at the eight of this treasure. \nBARTENDER: Another? \nHOGGLE hesitates, then hands the circlet over. The BARTENDER bites it and his face lights up with glee. \nBARTENDER: Plastic! \nHe goes to get the drink and HOGGLE puts his face down on the bar and sobs. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAt the other end of the bar sits the WISE ONE. The HAT looks over at HOGGLE and shakes his head knowingly. \nHAT: Drinkin' to forget, eh, buddy? \nHOGGLE looks up. \nWISE ONE: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate from one's consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to drink the waters of Lethe ... \nHOGGLE (drunkenly): What's Lethe ... \n", "test3_id": 1172}

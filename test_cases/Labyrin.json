{"train": "L A B Y R I N T H \nby Laura Phillips and Terry Jones \nStory by Dennis Lee \nEarly movie script scanned in by Cruiser One on Dec 28, 1996 \nReformatted by Zelos, 16-Apr. 2004 \nFADE IN ON: \n1\tEXT: SKY - DAY \nA WHITE BIRD soaring. The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and mauve and lavender. The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate pink tint. The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with him. Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears. \n2\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY \nIt is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala like intricacy. From our magnificent vantage point, WE ARE BARELY ABLE TO MAKE OUT its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and there by lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castle at the core. It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling at the same time. We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get a better look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on \n3\tEXT: GLADE - DAY \nIt is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting. The late afternoon sun washes everything with a pink glow. Between the water and a line of lush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade. A FIGURE emerges from the trees and walks toward the water. It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a flowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze. The pink light burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her head to glow. She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace. She stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has heard something. \nGIRL: Is it you? \nShe takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shyly \nGIRL: Your Highness! \nThe GIRL curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes, the shy smile still dancing on her lips. And then WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls. WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly at the PRINCE. \nGIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord. For though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannot consent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest hill to deepest dale is ... \nSuddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her face. \nGIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... (her brow furrows in concentration and then) Damn! \nShe burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a rolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages. \nThe PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil crown. He thinks his work is over and it's time to play and he lunges happily towards the GIRL who isn't a princess or even a duchess, but 15-year-old SARAH. \nSARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which WE CAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all, WE SEE faded jeans and running shoes. \nSARAH: Get off me, you monster!! \nThe DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping to be chased. SARAH doesn't follow, she just sits up and pulls the grass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOG comes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully. \nSARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you'll hand it over. \nThe DOG obediently drops the book. \nTHE BOOK \nOn the cover it says, _MEANDER'S QUEEN a play in three acts by Robin Zakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime. \nSARAH leaps to her feet. \nSARAH: Oh no, Merlin! We're really late! Why does everything have to happen to me!!!? \nMERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAH pulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. He rushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch. \nSARAH: It's all your fault, you miserable mutt!! \nShe hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers and tags along behind her. \nSTEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up! \nShe hurries down the stairs. \nFATHER: We'll see you later, baby. And remember ... \n7B\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSARAH speaks along with him, mimicking. \nSARAH & FATHER (VO): Don't open the door to strangers. \nWe hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens her bedroom door. \nSARAH: And don't call me baby! (she slams the door shut; mimicking her parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold \nShe sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat, and she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filled with an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books are lined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we would see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and according to the year they were acquired. She walks over to her dresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of drawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew by her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs on the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLE GIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is taped to the mirror. The headline says, \"Linda Williams a Smash in New Play.\" A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says _Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverently opens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to the strains of an unbearably tinny version of \"Greensleeves\" she begins to rehearse. \nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord \nSuddenly, something stops her cold. \nSARAH (yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room! \nThrough the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of the shelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door. \n8\tINT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHT \nSARAH bursts out of her room. \nSARAH: Where's Lancelot? \nShe stomps down the hallway. \nSARAH: Where's my bear?!! \n9\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT \nSARAH enters FREDDIE's room. She searches the nursery. \nSARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say. \nShe opens a toy box and rifles through it. \nSARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ... \nShe gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurgling at Lancelot, SARAH's tattered old teddy bear. \nSARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear! \nShe yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and his face starts to cloud up. \n10\tINT: SARAH 'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits beside her. She looks at the DOG. \nSARAH: You're the only one who understands me, Merlin. \nHe licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her. \nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord \nShe is interrupted by FREDDIE's cries. \nSARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie! \nSARAH: Where's Freddie?!! \nZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. She calls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living room doorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stops and listens. \nSARAH: Freddie? \nBut it wasn't a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying as CREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hear faint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified. \nSARAH: Where is he?!! \nZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind the chair and can't see anything. But when she comes around in front of it she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And he's playing with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs the puppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops up the BABY. \nSARAH: Who are you?!!! \nZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the sofa and lands very close to her. \nZAKAR: I've been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is _Jareth, King of the Goblins_!!! \nSARAH holds FREDDIE close and backs away. \nSARAH: I don't believe this! \nAmidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air, and he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak swirling around him. And what's worse, much, much worse, is that suddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from under chairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of the room. \n18\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT \nIt's worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOME slide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, but is soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to the front door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. The GOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right into JARETH's arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAH tries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them. \nSARAH (hysterical): Give him back, you monster! Give him back! \nJARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughs with delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhuman effort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs onto JARETH's fluttering cloak. It's like being caught up in a whirlwind of incredible force. \nSARAH (screaming): I ... won't ... let ... you ... take ... him! \nBut it's too late. SARAH's feet leave the ground and she is pulled with them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl up through where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness. There's a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETH's laughing face; SARAH, desperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, who's having a great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETH's garment pulls out of SARAH's grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on her face. \n19\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY A WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT \nThe sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO SEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wall that extends off in either direction. Along the wall are various ornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to us, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one of those ornamental garden sculptures. But it isn't. This is HOGGLE. In a CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, and goes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-like creatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes. \nHOGGLE: An' how's me pride an' joy! \nHe leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing with pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped by the whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky and lands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury. \nHOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer! \nSARAH struggles out of the broken shrub. \nSARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?! \nHOGGLE: I ain't horrible, I'm _Hoggle_. And just look! You've destroyed me prize blossoms! \nHe realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen. \nHOGGLE: I'll get ya for it, you big oaf! \nAnd he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But she's had enough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop from the deepest space, this guy is child's play. She reaches out and pulls the can from HOGGLE's hands. She then grabs him by the shirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground. \nSARAH: Oh no you don't! If anyone's getting anything around here, it's me ... now where' my brother?!! \nHOGGLE: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'til ye let me go! \nSARAH sighs and lets go. \nSARAH: I'm sorry. But this just hasn't been my day. \n22\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY \nSARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is huge and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall. \nFACE: Go back! Go back before it's too late! \nSARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the corridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER FACE. \nFACE 2: Turn back while you still can!! \nSARAH turns and runs back the way she came. \nSARAH: Hoggle! \n23\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY \nHOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face. SARAH comes rushing toward him. \nSARAH: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here! They were horrible ... \nHOGGLE: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya? \nHe shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came from. \nHOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya haven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle. \nSARAH quickly follows. \nSARAH: False Alarms? \n24\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY \nThe corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their routine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight. \nFACE 1: This is the path of no return! \nFACE 2: Beware! Beware! \nHOGGLE: Just ignore 'em. \nSARAH: Are you sure? \nHOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE. \nFACE 3: Abandon all hope ... \nHOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya? \nSARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE's defiance. \nFACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part! \nHOGGLE: All right. But don't expect us to pay any attention. \nFACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this ... Abandon all hope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!! \nHOGGLE (bored): Very nice ... \nSARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along. \nFACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you're doomed, doomed! \n25\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY \nHOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor. \nJARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isn't it? \nHOGGLE is humiliated. \nHOGGLE: Me name's Hoggle. \nJARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. (he moves closer to Hoggle) You're the greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn't you be back there minding your own business ... Hedgehog? \nHe chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLE fumes silently. SARAH doesn't like this. \nSARAH: Why, why don't you pick on someone your own size? \nHe looks her up and down. \nJARETH: Whom did you have in mind? \nSARAH tries to brazen it out. \nSARAH: I don't have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I want him now! \nJARETH throws back his head and laughs. \nJARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I'm really growing rather fond of him. \nSARAH: Where is he?!! \nJARETH: He's in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely. \nHe ambles toward them and they can't help themselves, they BOTH step backwards. \nJARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, I'm considering turning him into one. \nSARAH thinks this is crazy. \nSARAH: You can't do that! \nJARETH (grinning): Oh yes I can. \nSARAH looks down at HOGGLE and speaks under her breath. \nSARAH: Can he? \nHOGGLE nods glumly. \nJARETH: But let's make it interesting. I won't do it for ... thirteen hours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to save him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorable goblin prince, don't you? \nHe laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. He then closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch in one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyes it greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks at it and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks up again, JARETH is gone. \nWORM (VO): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish! \nSARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is coming from. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in the brickwork. \nWORM: That's what the missus always says, she does. Why the last time she found that one around here she sent him packing. \nSARAH: Jareth?! \nWORM: She don't take to his kind of nonsense, that's for sure. Now, how about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on. \nSARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORM and gives him a beaming smile. \n28\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY \nSARAH and HOGGLE are sitting on the floor. \nSARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it on time? \nHe looks down at the still mumbling WISE ONE. \nHAT: Enough! Nobody cares!! \nThe WISE ONE blinks and looks at SARAH and HOGGLE. \nWISE ONE: Did one of you say something? \nSARAH thinks quickly. \nSARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers. \nWISE ONE: That's very wise. An idea worth savoring. \nHOGGLE nudges him. \nHOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat! \nHOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesn't. \nHAT: Ve-ry funny! \nThe WISE ONE continues on his way. \nWISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. I'm glad you brought that up. The stranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from beyond the sea ... \nHAT (hysterical): I quit! I can't take it anymore! \nAnd then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it wasn't there. SARAH watches after them, stunned. \nSARAH: How did he do that?!! \nHOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesn't come back? \nSARAH gives him a look and turns to the WORM. \nWORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through it. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. It doesn't apply around here. \nSARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONE entered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is actually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yells back to the WORM. \nSARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus we're sorry we missed her biscuits! \nAnd then they walk through the wall and are gone. \n29\tINT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAY \nSARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs with delight. HOGGLE wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels the wall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that they are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to the top of one and looks over. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH'S POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE \nSARAH (excited): I can see the castle! It doesn't look far at all! \nHOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how they got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor. \nSARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Let's go! \nHOGGLE sees her retreating figure and hurries after her. \n30\tINT: CASTLE - DAY \nJARETH's great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over the labyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the hovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to the dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost in thought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder. Behind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is too much for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him. Meanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approach JARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALE GOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning. \nFEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! It's bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ... \nIn another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF LITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the oncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and as they do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the cracks between the bricks. \nIn a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of spears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction. \nThey enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming small, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for a breath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. They scurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie across an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below. \n35\tINT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY \nSARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO GOBLINS bring up the rear. \nGOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can. \nGOBLIN 2: But I'm better at maiming. Everybody says so. \nAnd they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from their hiding places. \nSARAH: Do you think they're gone? \nHOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, ya know. They has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze as you do. \nHe folds his arms and leans against the wall. \nSARAH: I'm not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ... \nSuddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned on another secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows. \n36\tINT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAY \nHOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that divides the maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth -- the Garden Maze. \nHOGGLE (excited): I think I know where we are! \nSARAH: That'll be a nice change. \nHe ignores her and looks around excitedly. \nHOGGLE: This place is the end o' the maze! That means we're near the entrance ta the second ring o' the labyrinth. \nSARAH: The second ring? What's that? \nHOGGLE starts down the corridor. \nHOGGLE (happily): The Garden Maze! \nSARAH (gloomy): Sounds like a great place ... what's it like? \nHOGGLE: Don't know, I ain't never made it this far before. \nHe is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something. It is a strange clanking sound. \nSARAH (frightened): Hoggle! What's that sound?!! \nHOGGLE stops skipping and sighs. \nHOGGLE: Now don't go gettin' all girly on me, Missy, now that we's finally safe ... \nSARAH: So you think we're safe, do you? \nHOGGLE (annoyed): Didn't I just say so?!! \nSARAH: Then tell me what you think of that. \nSARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. It is now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look. He screams. \nANOTHER ANGLE \n38\tEXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY \nSARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him. \nSARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I'd never see you again! \nHOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don't work with the floor, as well! \nSARAH laughs and hugs him again. \n39\tINT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY \nSARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They are tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and sighs. \nSARAH: An hour's gone by and I don't think we're more than four feet from where we started. \nHOGGLE: That's 'cause ya won't do what I tells ya. It's clear as day we should be goin' this way ... \nHe turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in pain and SARAH sighs and follows him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge. \nSARAH: Got any more suggestions? \nBefore HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible gut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around. \nSARAH: It sounds like it came from over there! \nHOGGLE points in the opposite direction. \nHOGGLE: Then let's go this way. \nSARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again. \nSARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone's being hurt! \nHOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction! \nSARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become more unbearable. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the screams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through. HOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from screaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he heads right back into the maze. \n40\tEXT: CLEARING - DAY \nSARAH'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) that they have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken pains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of them and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall, powerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly unbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing him. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting CREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO, who bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are free to bite him whenever they get near. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge. \nSARAH: The poor thing! \nHOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH looks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and carefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks his helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around, swinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE. \nBLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights? \nThe OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks towards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The OTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE CAN SEE their progress in the BG. \nLUDO quickly steps between SARAH and the doors. \nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad. \nHOGGLE: Well, that's great news. (to Ludo) Don't suppose ya know which is which? \nSARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer look at them. \nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ... \nHOGGLE: All right, ya walkin' mountain! Ya made ya point. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Each one has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces, except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it stuck in its mouth. \nSARAH (to herself): I guess once you choose a door ... all you have to do is knock. \nThe KNOCKER with the ring through its ears speaks. \nKNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me? \nSARAH jumps back, stunned. \nSARAH: You can talk! \nKNOCKER 1: What? What? You'll have to speak up!! \nKNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ... \nSARAH turns to the OTHER KNOCKER. \nSARAH: You too! \nKNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ... \nSARAH shakes her head in amazement. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe BOYS are still at it. \nHOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest? \nLUDO: Ludo ... not ... know. \nHOGGLE: That figures, don't it? (he turns his back on Ludo, fuming) Why the Missy wants an overgrown hill o' hair fer a friend is beyond me. \nLUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder. HOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH is excited. \nSARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! (to Knocker 1) Are you the right door to the forest? \nKNOCKER 1: It doesn't do to ask me. For some reason I can't hear a thing. \nSARAH turns to KNOCKER 1. \nKNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble. \nKNOCKER 2 gets very excited. \nKNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ... \nHOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door swings open. \nHOGGLE: I'm coming ... \nHe rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voice that he is falling down a deep hole. \nHOGGLE (echoed): ... Miiiiiiiiissy! \nWe hear a huge splash. Then that door shuts and LUDO is all alone. \nLUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone. \nHe is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and begins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE. LUDO brightens and chases after them. \nLUDO: Wait! \nThe WISE ONE stops and the HAT looks LUDO up and down. \nHAT: This ought to be a good one! \nLUDO: Ludo ... need ... door! \nWISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very useful thing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that which gives access, a gate or gangway ... \nHe continues walking and LUDO walks with him, listening intently. \nWISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a propylaeum ... \nHAT (sighs): If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is, if I had ears ... \nWISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ... \n44\tEXT: FOREST - DAY \nSARAH has waited long enough. \nSARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you? \nShe reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand is on the 7. \nSARAH: (whispers) Oh, Freddie! (she shoves the watch back into her pocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me 'cause I can't wait. \nThen determined, she strides off. \n45.\tINT: HOLE - DAY \nHOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. There is a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it. \nHOGGLE: Somebody help me! I can't swim! \n46\tEXT: FOREST - DAY \nSARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearly lost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it to get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits down on the ground. \nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me? \nBut there's no time to think about that because she hears the sound of a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering LITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the clearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH is terrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the CREATURES aren't doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed, frenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and can't help but be taken in by the wild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to the wild rhythm. \nSARAH (laughing, moving): What are you? \nWILD THING 1: We're Wild Things, baby! Wild! \nWILD THING 2: Wild and free! \nWILD THING 3: Get down! \nJARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I've definitely got something better in mind! \nHOGGLE: Don't you hurt her! \nHOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back down into the water. \nJARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_. \nHe grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water. \nJARETH: You can be with me or against me. \nHOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do? \nJARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ... \nHe leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE's face. \nJARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me. \nHOGGLE: Never! I'd rather die! \nJARETH sneers scornfully. \nJARETH: Then so you shall. \nHe drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight. HOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering. \nHOGGLE: Wait! \nJARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of amusement on his face. \nHOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you'll do to her! \nHe splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water. \nJARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ... \nHe reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach. \nJARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this. \nHe tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the water starts to recede. \nJARETH: You've made a very wise decision. \nHe leaves, followed by the GOBLINS. \nHOGGLE: I didn't decide nuthin'! \nHOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and he is sitting on cold, damp ground. \n48\tEXT: FOREST - DAY \nThe WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along but they couldn't care less. \nSARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle? \nWILD THING 1: Oh, did you say \"the castle\"? \nWILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle! \nWILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle! \nWILD THING 1: Rassle! That's a _wild_ idea! \nHOGGLE: Missy! \n50\tINT: FOREST - DAY \nSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They do not know that they are being spied on by JARETH'S GOBLINS. \n51\tINT: CLEARING - DAY \nThe THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a wide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can see. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts on either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily. \nSARAH: It doesn't look too strong but we don't have much choice ... \nSuddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice. \nVOICE (VO): Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith! \nAt first they don't see a thing and look around for the source of the voice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendent in rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the posts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH are dumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words. \nHOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ... \nDIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE. \nDIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword! \nHOGGLE snorts with derision and SARAH tries a more sensible approach. \nSARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. It's a matter of life and death! \nDIDYMUS shrugs elegantly. \nDIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you, fair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one. \nSARAH: Oh, it is! \nDIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass. \nSARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. It appears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS up into the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walk toward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword. \nDIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde! \nTo his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking. \nDIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or _die_! \nThis gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed. \nHOGGLE: What _is_ this weasel babblin' about? \nIt is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mighty war cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him, administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places. HOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. He comes back and faces LUDO. \nDIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me the gravest affront! \nAnd with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling, begins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for a triumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there is nothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It is the most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity DIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of LUDO's branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty. And LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword, leaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts him totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their weapons. And, to everyone's surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword. \nDIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble knight. \nThen DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to look LUDO in the eyes. \nDIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will. \nLUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upset his gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw. \nDIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight, have fought me to a standstill. \nLUDO kneels and tentatively takes DIDYMUS' paw into his own huge hand. \nThe music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is a magnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th Century Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to the music in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer you sense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded. The GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces, giving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something very provocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders and daring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to the waist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is the feeling that the party has been going on all night. In this setting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickering behind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terribly self-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks into one of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her image. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her gasp. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancing with a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, trying to get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to see him that she doesn't notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a YOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whispers something into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MAN throws back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at waist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAH's music box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the cover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved like a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backs away. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on. JARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before, watches SARAH. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whisper something to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask and licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herself looking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isn't with a partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur around him, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around to face the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And then she realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she moves through the CROWD to get a better look. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH'S POV - She is whirling in JARETH's arms, and she is the most beautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and the attraction between them is palpable. \nJARETH: You look like a queen. \nSARAH looks up at him, thrilled by his words. \nSARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... don't know what I feel ... \nJARETH (smiling): Don't you? \nAnd he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in his arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his grip around her waist. \nSARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble? \nJARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can come true. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almost falls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across the lap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backs away from them, frightened. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has never looked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as if he, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with his lips and whispers in her ear. \nJARETH (whispering): My Queen! \nThen he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give her everything she wants, even things she doesn't know she wants. A song that says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness. Forget and stay in the dream. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closer to JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushed out of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumbles against a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flying and she can't make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMAN comes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moves his face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comes closer, and closer. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nOUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs, pushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubble itself. \n57\tEXT: BALL - NIGHT \nSARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom crumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard. \n58\tEXT JUNK CITY - NIGHT \nSARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. There are piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents from which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approach SARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER works behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down. \nHOGGLE: Another! \nThe BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure off his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours. \n66\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT \nDIDYMUS and LUDO approach the red tent. They spy the JUNK WOMAN. \nDIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way? \nJUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin' in a place like this? \nDIDYMUS: She's on a rescue mission ... \nThe JUNK WOMAN finds this hilarious. \nJUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! You're in the wrong place, for sure! The only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our worldly goods! \nShe takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for emphasis. \n67\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out hopefully. \nSARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me! \nThe door opens and the JUNK WOMAN peers inside. \nJUNK WOMAN: Don't worry, Dearie. I sent 'im away! \nSARAH groans. \nJUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for no rescue mission. \nSARAH: Oh my god! Freddie! \nJUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that nice teddy? \nSARAH struggles for the door in the sea of junk. \nSARAH: No! He's my brother! And I've got to save him! \nShe continues pushing through the junk. \nJUNK WOMAN: No you don't, Dearie. You can stay right 'ere with all your pretty fings ... \nSARAH knows what her choice has to be. \nSARAH: I know I can. (joyous) But I don't want to! \nShe lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in the doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly. \nSARAH: Now get out of my way! \n68\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT \nSARAH runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face. \nThe JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to SARAH. \nJUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this! \nShe holds out SARAH's music box, opens it, and the little DANCER twirls inside. \nWISE ONE: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove from our minds what is too painful to remember ... \nHOGGLE looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand. \nWISE ONE: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that which brings us understanding, also enlightenment ... \nBut there is no one to continue benefitting from the WISE ONE's pearls. HOGGLE is gone. \nHAT: You can cool it down there ... he's gone ... \nWISE ONE: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ... \nThe HAT sighs and looks over at the BARTENDER who is still admiring his plastic treasure. \nHAT: Another one over here ... and make it a double ... \n72\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT \nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS emerge into the vast courtyard outside the castle. It in eerily quiet. Too quiet. \nSARAH: We're going to make it! \nDIDYMUS sniffs the air. \nDIDYMUS: I am less than sure ... \nThey are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on LUDO's back. Then the courtyard is filled with GOBLINS, what seems like the whole army, coming right at them. DIDYMUS fends off the VANGUARD PARTY with his sword and LUDO punches out the ones that get by him. DIDYMUS unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying. SARAH picks it up and does some parrying of her own. But there are too many of them. The threesome turn and run. \n73\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT \nJARETH stands by the window, watching the battle. The WHITE BIRD sits on his shoulder. JARETH looks over at FREDDIE who stands holding on to the side of the cradle. JARETH smiles and turns back to the melee below. The BIRD flies out the window. \n74\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT \nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS race down the streets. The GOBLINS are in hot pursuit. \n75\tEXT: STREET - NIGHT \nThey come careening around a corner and it seems that they have escaped their pursuers. The sound of the GOBLINS seems to be getting farther away. \nSARAH: I think we lost them. \nThey turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and are right back in the courtyard. LUDO climbs part way up a wall and looks over the streets. \nDIDYMUS: What do you see, my brother? \nLUDO gulps. What he sees is the GOBLIN ARMY coming down every street right towards them. \nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... trouble! \nAnd then the trouble arrives and SARAH and DIDYMUS are heavily into swordplay. LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by GOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and sees his predicament. She gets an idea. \nSARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks! \nLUDO makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall. \nHe then throws his head back and bellows. \n76\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT \nAn enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with boulders, all careening towards LUDO. They knock GOBLINS out of their path like so many bowling pins. \n77\tEXT: COURTYARD - NIGHT \nSARAH and DIDYMUS fight bravely. LUDO keeps bellowing and throwing off the occasional GOBLIN that is stupid enough to jump on him. Soon the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the THREESOME and their ATTACKERS. LUDO reaches down and lifts SARAH and DIDYMUS on to the wall. They jump and disappear into the castle enclave. \nIt certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the struggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever and it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering the courtyard. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER aims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles with the door. It won't budge and he begins to smash his body against it. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body on the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit. They hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes down the door and they run in. \n83\tINT: JARETH'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nSARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have seen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is there and FREDDIE's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him only moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks feverishly around the room. She spots a door. \nSARAH: That's the only way he could have gone! \nShe runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow. \nSARAH: No. I have to face him alone! \nDIDYMUS: But, my lady ... \nHe is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start trying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body against it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side. \nHOGGLE: I don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ... \nShe puts her finger to his lips. \nSARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives? \nHOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ... \nSARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ... \nShe looks down at his empty belt. \nSARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process. \nHOGGLE: I don't care if I never sees another treasure again! \nSARAH (smiles): Here. Just in case you change your mind. \nShe slips off her mother's ring and presses it into HOGGLE's hand. He is overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure. \nHOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me. \nSARAH: Jareth doesn't know everything. \nShe leaps to her feet and HOGGLE moans. \nSARAH: Take care of him, Didymus. \nDIDYMUS: I'll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life! \nThe GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses against the door even harder. \nLUDO: Ludo ... too! \nShe runs to the other door and stops to look back at them. \nSARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights. \nSARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by repulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ... \nJARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in the world, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do. \nSARAH looks at him. \nSARAH: Anything else? \nJARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course. \nSARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left. She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer to FREDDIE. \nSARAH: And what if I'm not interested? \nJARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head. \nJARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ... \nSARAH: Well, I've got news for you, Jareth. \nShe makes a beeline for the cradle. \nSARAH: I don't want _you_! \nShe's almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her. \nSARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep! \nJARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and punches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up the screaming FREDDIE. \nSARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!! \nJARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned. \nJARETH: You hit me! \nSARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him. \nSARAH: And I'd like to do more ... you, you ... ! \nShe is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the BABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin. JARETH howls and grabs his leg. \nSARAH: I wouldn't want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth! \nThe WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH's shoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears. \nJARETH: Don't say that! \nBut it is too late, he starts shrinking. \nJARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me! \nBefore SARAH's eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective, snivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but still recognizably JARETH. \n86\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT \nJARETH's quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks the door. \nJARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me! \nThey look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS are no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh. \nHOGGLE (proudly): She did it! \nThey cheer. \n", "test1_input": "ZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make a delightful Queen Meander. \nSARAH: Well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know? \nZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard that it was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production of the play, which of course is delightful for me. \nSARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed. The firemen had to use the hall. \nZAKAR: Yes, I know, that's why I wanted to stop by to see you. \nThey are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. And then FREDDIE begins to howl. \nSARAH: That's my brother ... \nThere is another crash and SARAH starts up the stairs. \nSARAH: I'll be right back! \nZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walks right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle. \n15\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT \nFREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes in and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is crashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIE's screams are piteous. \nSARAH: Oh, Freddie ... \nThere is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened room. \nZAKAR (VO): Perhaps I can soothe him ... \nSARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He has a drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close. \nSARAH: You shouldn't be up here! \nZAKAR (smoothly): I just wanted to help ... \nSARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY. \n16\tINT: HALLWAY - NIGHT \nSARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKAR follows. FREDDIE is still crying. \nSARAH: Maybe you'd better leave ... \nShe gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR is making her very nervous. \nSARAH: ... I, uh, don't think I care to talk to you about the play. \nHe is right behind her, almost too close. \nZAKAR: Neither do I. \nSARAH is shocked and disturbed by this. \nSARAH: What! \nZAKAR reaches over and smoothes FREDDIE's hair. \nZAKAR: I'm more concerned about the baby, of course. \nSARAH pulls FREDDIE out of his reach. \nSARAH: Freddie's just fine. \nBut he isn't. He's still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket and pulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front of FREDDIE's face. The BABY stops crying. \n", "test1_true": "SARAH (nervously): Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ... \nZAKAR ignores her and heads into the living room. \nZAKAR: I'm not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in here and I'll do some other tricks for him ... \nSARAH: No! You've got to ... \nBut he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding the BABY. \n17\tINT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH stands in the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sits down across from him. \nZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ... \nHe reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there. It comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAH rolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isn't impressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again. \nZAKAR: So you're going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, you know what that means? \nHe leans across the table and SARAH pulls the BABY closer. \nZAKAR: It's time to call the goblins! \nSARAH: What?!! \nSARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes her silly threat to FREDDIE earlier. \nZAKAR: Yes. That's what we do with bad babies ... we send for the goblins!! \nAnd with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a poorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughs with relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched, unconvincing goblin voice. \nZAKAR: You like goblins, don't'cha, Freddie? (singsong) but I bet your sister doesn't ... \nSARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one very strange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKAR's hands are visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table, and disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps out of her chair. \nSARAH: Where is it?!!! \nZAKAR points to a large cabinet against the wall. \nZAKAR: It's in there. \nSARAH: Impossible! \nZAKAR: See for yourself. \nSARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully on the rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the door. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nthe puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around to face ZAKAR. \nSARAH: How did you do that?!! \nZAKAR leans back into the sofa. \nZAKAR: Magic. \nSARAH: Oh sure ... \nShe nods, skeptically. She can't see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE -- the cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny, fierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creature that moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH is busy with another problem. She doesn't see FREDDIE! \n", "test1_id": 1170, "test2_input": "SARAH: Is it difficult? \nHOGGLE snorts with derision. \nHOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion? \nSARAH is reaching the breaking point. \nSARAH: Look, I'm sorry about your bush! But it's not like I asked to have some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out of the sky! \nHOGGLE: Well, I didn't ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on me prized possession, neither! \nSARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous! \nAnd she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way. \nSARAH (to herself): ... standing here wasting time talking to some weird guy who should be living under a bridge ... \nShe is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through the gate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what might be the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. There's no way she wants to risk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and as she backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks and whirls around. \nHOGGLE: That ain't the only way in, ya know! \nSARAH is very relieved to hear this. \nSARAH: It's not?! \nHOGGLE: Course it ain't. There's many a route in ... just only one way out. \nSARAH: Well show me one! I've got to find my brother! \nHOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling it in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch and bracelet and ring you can imagine. \nHOGGLE: Information like that has a price ... \nSARAH, taken aback by the amount of loot he's acquired. \nSARAH: I could give you this ... \nShe takes the gold circlet off her head. HOGGLE isn't interested. \nHOGGLE: I had sumthin' o' this caliber in mind ... \nHe takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby ring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently. \nSARAH: No. My mother gave me that. \nHOGGLE eyes it greedily. \nHOGGLE: She could give ya another ... \nSARAH: No, she couldn't. (sadness crosses her face suddenly) She lives real far away ... \nThe sadness disappears just as suddenly. She holds out the circlet. \nSARAH: This is all you get. \nHe grabs the circlet and bites it. \nHOGGLE: Bah! It's paste! \nSomething catches SARAH's eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES. She leans over for a better look. \nSARAH: No it's not, it's plastic. \nHOGGLE's eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he strings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to the FAIRY. \n", "test2_true": "HOGGLE reaches for the spray can. \nHOGGLE: Let me at it! \nSARAH is enraged. \nSARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!! \nJust then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off her hand and cries out in pain. \nSARAH: It bit me! \nHOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth, screaming all the way. \nHOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! There's nuthin' more vicious than a flower fairy. Any fool knows that! \nSARAH sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry. \nHOGGLE (sighs): But you don't know nuthin', do ya? \nA tear trickles down SARAH's cheek. HOGGLE sighs. \nHOGGLE: I got a feelin' I'm gonna regret this. (he stalks off) Come with me an' I'll show ya a way in. \nSARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLE looks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve. \nHOGGLE (thrilled): Plastic! \n20\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY \nAnother part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAH a tiny door. She looks at it dubiously. \nHOGGLE: This'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of the labyrinth ... \nSARAH: The first part! What comes after that? \nHOGGLE gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door. \nHOGGLE: Then there's the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ... \nSARAH: That sounds inviting ... \nHe is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH can't hear him. She quickly tries to follow. \nSARAH: Wait! Wait! I can't hear you ... \n21\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY \nHOGGLE is through the door. \nHOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ... \nSARAH's head appears. \nHOGGLE: ... that's surely where Jareth's keepin' the babe ... \nHe looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist and straining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabs her hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the doorway. She lands flat on her face. \nHOGGLE: Ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya? \nHe chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets up and dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seems rather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a flower peeks through a crack. \nSARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesn't seem so bad at all. \nAnd with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor. \n", "test2_id": 1171, "test3_input": "DIDYMUS yells across to LUDO. \nDIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother? \nLUDO: Save ... baby. \nDIDYMUS is overwhelmed. \nDIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon my sword. \nHe bows low before SARAH and she smiles. \nSARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus. \nHOGGLE frowns with displeasure at this latest development. \nHOGGLE: This is all well an' good, Missy. But we still got one little problem. \nThey all look across the fissure at LUDO. \nLUDO: Ludo ... friends. \nHOGGLE: Yes, yes. We're friends. Very nice. What's that got ta do with us gettin' over there without a bridge? \nLUDO: Rocks ... friends. \nHOGGLE: We're wastin' our time, Missy. Let's you an' me go find another ... \nHe is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by a sympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions until there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk across. \nLUDO: Rocks ... friends! \nSARAH (laughing): They sure are, Ludo! \nShe skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUS whistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAH gasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN. \nSARAH: It's ... \nDIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed. \nSARAH laughs and shrugs. Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth. \n52\tEXT: FOREST - NIGHT \nThe edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in the distance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full of stars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire. \nDIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady? \nSARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how. \nDIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights to defend your honor? \nSARAH: Not even one. \nDIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does such dishonor to my lady? \nSARAH: It's a place where ... where nobody really sees me. \nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah! \nSARAH: (laughs) I know you do, Ludo. (she turns to Didymus) And thanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight. \nHe bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feels rejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire. After a moment, SARAH follows him. \nSARAH: Don't you feel like resting? \n", "test3_true": "SARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry. \nHOGGLE winces but SARAH doesn't notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO and DIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes against AMBROSIUS' side. \nSARAH: They're both wonderful, aren't they? \nHOGGLE: They're alright. \nSARAH: They're more than that! They're loyal and strong ... and with their help I'm going to beat Jareth! \nHOGGLE shakes his head sadly. SARAH speaks as an afterthought. \nSARAH: And yours, too, of course. \nHOGGLE: I ain't no fighter ... \nShe shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle. HOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision. \nHOGGLE: Missy ... if you're hungry ... \nHe holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the world's most delicious looking peach. \nSARAH: Oh, great! \nShe happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE has to not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and then stumbles. \nSARAH (laughing): Everything's dancing ... \nShe looks up at the sky, exhilarated. \nSARAH: Even the stars are dancing! \nHOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as she gazes happily at the sky. \n53\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT \nFREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around the room, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and knees in front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN and sends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and he pulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on the head. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sits down next to him. \nJARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you. \nHe waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautiful crystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers like so many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks up his legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his pajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings the balls into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing bubbles. \nJARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ... \nAnd they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over the labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky. \n54\tEXT: FOREST - NIGHT \nSARAH's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the ground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles are approaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music, haunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEE that each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the one in SARAH's music box. She gets up and follows them. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHOGGLE watching from the woods. \nHOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! (He turns and begins to walk away) And damn me too! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appears enchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS. \n55\tEXT: BALLROOM - NIGHT \nA giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubbles rush to join it. In one of them is SARAH. \n56\tINT: BALLROOM - NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 1172}

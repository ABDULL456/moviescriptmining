No reply. Needy braces herself against the kitchen counter and bawls. She falls to her knees and curls up on the floor, exhausted. 
Her eyes drift shut. NEEDY V.O. I've always been able to feel what she feels. Just not like this. 
EXT. SUNNY SUBURBAN YARD - FLASHBACK - DAY 
Little Needy and Little Jennifer are playing Barbies in a sandbox. Needy holds a brand new, immaculate Barbie doll. 
LITTLE JENNIFER I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you be her. 
She tosses Needy a naked brunette doll with its hair chopped off and an arm missing. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LITTLE NEEDY Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley? 
LITTLE JENNIFER You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken. Choose. 
She puts her hand down in the sand emphatically and suddenly HOWLS in pain. 
LITTLE NEEDY What's wrong, Jennifer? 
Jennifer lifts her hand. There's a TACK stuck in her palm and it's bleeding. 
LITTLE JENNIFER OWWWWWW! (trying to swear like a grown-up) Damn! Ass! 
Needy grabs Jennifer's hand, pulls out the tack and wipes away the blood. It's still bleeding. Panicking, she leans forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound. 
Jennifer watches quietly. Needy pulls away. 
LITTLE NEEDY Better. We should get a Band-Aid though. 
LITTLE JENNIFER We're sisters now, you know. 
Needy nods. 
LITTLE JENNIFER (CONT'D) Don't tell my mom about this. She'll make me get a shot.

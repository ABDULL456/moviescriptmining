KAREN Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way... 
She pauses.  He turns and looks at her. 
GLENN Like how? 
EXT. OVERPASS - SAME 
Foley watches a car pass on the highway. 
BUDDY You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"? 
FOLEY I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances. 
BUDDY You're too late, Jack. 
Foley doesn't say anything.  Just takes a deep breath as we HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over... 
BUDDY (CONT'D) He wants to get out of here and I don't blame him. 
They start towards the car.  Then stop and watch as it takes off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement.  Their backs to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word. 
We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER... 
CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC 
As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY -- strut purposefully up the hall.  They step into... 
THE PRISON LIBRARY 
Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH." 
MAURICE Dick.  My man. 
Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) I got your fishies for you. 
He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the table. 
RIPLEY (reaches for them) Thank you... 
MAURICE (pulls them back) Not so fast, Dick. (off Ripley's look) Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase. 
RIPLEY What? 
MAURICE Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up. 
RIPLEY I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But then, I could be wrong... 
MAURICE Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about. 
Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Let's start with the fish.  They was two grand, but now they's three. 
Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks. 
RIPLEY (writing) Well, I need that... 
MAURICE ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's. 
VOICE Hey. 
They all look to where... 
JACK FOLEY 
Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of some kind.  Himey gives him a mean stare.  Foley points to a sign that says "QUIET PLEASE." 
FOLEY Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read? 
MAURICE (beat) There a problem, Foley? 
FOLEY Yeah. 
Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR. 
FOLEY Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow? 
MAURICE That's right. 
RIPLEY Sounds high, doesn't it? 
FOLEY Must be a real soft pillow. 
MAURICE Faux goose down. 
RIPLEY Still... 
FOLEY How much for your company at chow? 
MAURICE Company, shit.  I watch the man's back. 
FOLEY I bet.  How much? 
MAURICE Another C. 
Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley. 
FOLEY You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off. 
RIPLEY Really?  Well, I uhhh... 
FOLEY First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you. 
Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point. 
MAURICE Man doesn't have to get killed.  He could accidentally fall on something sharp, like a shiv.  Or my dick.

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER There have naturally been questions of its authenticity, so to verify we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the Vatican.  Doc? 
ANNA (rising, to Hawk) Some of us warthogs are more constipated than others. 
Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage and pulls out a large magnifying glass.  A look of distress passes over her face.  Hawk closes his eyes in anticipation. 
HAWK Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa-- 
ANNA (suddenly serene) Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER We'll begin the bidding at 82.5 million dollars.  To you, sir. Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid, madame--Ninety point five..... 
Hawk opens his eyes in confusion.  He scans Anna coming off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.  Hawk floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks up a phone and murmurs into it. 
DARWIN MAYFLOWER lOO million clams, Francesco! 
The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high- fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER 100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin Mayflower. 
Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure. Anna looks up from the phone to do the same.  She swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk. 
Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce.  She is outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash, her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY. 
MINERVA Francesco, 100 million and one. 
Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart. 
DARWIN Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere. 
MINERVA Poor baby..... Here, Bunny. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100 million and one dollars. 
Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out of the nearby office, zipping up his fly.  He immedi- ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage. 
The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with devoured canary smiles. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Go-ing! 
Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to cause a scene.  Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's eyeline to Hawk. 
Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of the gloating Big Stan. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Go-ing! 
Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and veers back round up the aisle. 
The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity. 
ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Gone! 
The gavel comes down in super slow-motion. 
Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard. 
Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva. 
The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion. 
Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN. 
Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage. 
The Gavel hits. 
Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming, battered crowd. 
Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing position.  He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit. He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna rising from the ground. 
A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna. 
Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

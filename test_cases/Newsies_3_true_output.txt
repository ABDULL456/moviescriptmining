165B   INT. WORLD BLDG. - BASEMENT (AS IN SC. 152) - NIGHT          165B The THUDDING rhythm seems very near. Jack leads Sarah, David, Denton, Les down the rickety stairs with a candle. 
JACK They're  right above us -- and if Weasel  catches us, it won't be just me  they'll throw in the slammer  -- They can barely hear over the DIN of the PRESSES. 
SARAH What -- ? JACK I said shhhh! -- or we all go to jail! The others shush him hastily; MUSIC BEGINS as they go into --

Denton finds the type- font: David is ready to ink the rollers. A NOISE O.S. makes them freeze. Jack puts his finger to                      DENTON his lips; hoists Les up to     WHO'S THAT? the window to be a lookout. DAVID IS SOMEBODY COMING? 
LES NOT THAT I CAN SEE. David tosses some candles to Sarah; she lights them                    DAVID for Denton as he works.        NICE CATCH. SARAH THANKS. Jack finds a roll of newsprint.                                  JACK THAT OUGHTA GO THERE.                *

ALEX But how can it change every time? 
ALBERT It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible. 
NICK How the hell did you do that? 
ALBERT Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening. 
At this, a chill runs down Alex's spine. 
ALEX Dead? 
ALBERT Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important. 
ALEX Maybe he's not dead. 
ALBERT He? 
ALEX The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game. 
ALBERT (laughs) And maybe you've been taking too many drugs. 
Nick glances at the helmet again. 
NICK Could you play ARCADE with that? 
ALBERT Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype. 
Nick nods and smiles, offering his hand. 
NICK Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics? 
ALBERT Sure. 
Albert moves back to the computer console.  Meanwhile, Nick pulls Alex aside. 
NICK (quietly) Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay? 
ALEX What are you going to do? 
NICK Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible. 
ACROSS THE LAB, 
Albert is oblivious to their conversation. 
Alex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY 
Alex makes her way quickly down the hall, turning a corner and passing a SECURITY GUARD.  She waves at him, her smile fading as soon as she's passed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. R&D LAB - DAY 
Albert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from a laser printer.  He turns and hands them to Nick. 
ALBERT Here you go.  Happy hunting. 
Nick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket. 
NICK Thanks again. 
And with that, Nick pulls back his fist and punches Albert square in the face. 
Albert goes down, more stunned than hurt, and Nick springs into action. He scoops up the CyberHelmet in his free hand, kicks open the doors, and tosses his skateboard into the hallway... 
INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY 
Nick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, picking up speed like mad... 
He's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled EMPLOYEES.  And here comes a MAN with a mail cart... 
WHOOSH!  Nick zips by him.  And now an ALARM is ringing. 
NICK Shit... 
INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY 
Nick comes SCREECHING around the corner, narrowly missing a collision with two SECURITY GUARDS. 
GUARD #1 That's him!

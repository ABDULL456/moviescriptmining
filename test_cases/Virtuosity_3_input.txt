MADISON (wryly) No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. (a beat) How you feeling today? 
PARKER A little less than yesterday. 
MADISON In other words, par for the course. (a beat) How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday? 
PARKER John died. 
MADISON I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing. (a beat) If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation. 
PARKER You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it 혰혰 I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. 
MADISON That's not true, Parker. 
PARKER If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. 
MADISON (a beat) What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy? 
PARKER Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. 
MADISON You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. (a beat) You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target... 
PARKER Go to hell. 
MADISON It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it? (a beat) But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved. 
PARKER Enough! 
The Guard pokes his head in with concern. 
MADISON GET OUT! 
The Guard quickly shuts the door. Madison turns to Parker. 
MADISON (CONT'D) I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand. 
PARKER I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that. 
CUT TO: 
ON A VIRTUAL REALITY MONITOR 
inside Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC, the stunningly beautiful SHEILA 3.2 appears. In very revealing lingerie. Performing an outrageous strip혰tease. 
SHEILA 3.2 (seductively) I hope watching me is as big a turn on for you as dancing is for me... 
INSIDE LETAC 
Reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he could touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body. 
REILLY Oh, believe me, it is. It is... 
He is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other hand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine. 
On the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her strip혰tease. 
Slowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips. 
Putting on quite a show. 
She removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her nipples. As well as the rest of herself. 
Lindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely control himself. 
Sheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A virtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer pushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens. 
REILLY HEY!!! 
LINDENMEYER Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours. 
REILLY (paranoid) I haven't been working on anything. 
LINDENMEYER (threateningly) Do I get to see it or not? 
REILLY (a beat) Bastard... (to a monitor) Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. 
He rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next to Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila 3.2 enjoys the attention. 
SID 6.7 She's some of your finest work, Daryl. 
LINDENMEYER All my work is my finest. 
Sid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races back in, the monitors then all go BLACK.

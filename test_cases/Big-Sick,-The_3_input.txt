KUMAIL It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old lemon meringue pie? 
EMILY You're so funny! Actually, no, I just...I really need to get a cup of coffee. 
KUMAIL I can make you coffee. 
EMILY I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste. 
KUMAIL All right, I'll come with you. 
EMILY No, no! Why would you do that? 
KUMAIL It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna let you go on your own. 
EMILY Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's the most misogynist thing I've ever heard. 
KUMAIL Why are you being so weird? 
EMILY Fuck you, I'm not being weird. 
KUMAIL You're being so weird. 
EMILY Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're being so weird! 
KUMAIL How am I weird? I want to sleep while it's sleep time. 
EMILY This is normal. Girls go to get coffee in the middle of the night. Have you never had a girlfriend before? This is what it's like. 
KUMAIL Are you okay? 
EMILY Everything is not okay. Everything is not okay. 
KUMAIL You can tell me anything, you know that right? You can tell me anything. 
EMILY I have to take a shit, okay? I have to take a huge fucking dookie. I can't take a poo in your bathroom because you don't have any matches and you don't have any air freshener. What kind of person doesn't have any matches or air freshener in the bathroom? The walls are so thin! And Chris is right out there. 
Kumail starts laughing. 
EMILY (CONT'D) Please stop laughing! Please, please. 
KUMAIL Okay, I have an idea. 
EXT. KUMAIL'S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER 
Kumail sits on the stoop outside. After a beat, Emily sheepishly walks out and sits next to him. 
KUMAIL How are you? 
EMILY I do not want to talk about it. 
INT. BATTING CAGES - DAY 
Naveed fully geared up: batting helmet, gloves, elbow pad, eye-black. Kumail behind the backstop, watching. 
NAVEED Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about shifting weight and torque. 
A BALL ZINGS at Naveed, he misses completely. 
NAVEED (CONT'D) Oh Christ! 
KUMAIL Oh. 
Another ball zings. Misses again. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa. 
An 8-year old KID in a cage nearby cracks a clean hit. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Hey he's pretty good. Just do what he's doing. 
Naveed throws down his bat and exits the cage. 
INT. BATTING CAGE SNACK SHACK - LATER 
Kumail and Naveed eat from tiffins & ramekins. They fork- fight over their meal. 
NAVEED Mine. 
KUMAIL Come on.

PAUL A hundred dollars for breakfast? 
HAROLD Leave a tip. 
PENELOPE (suddenly twisting away, having been nearly hypnotized) I have some change! 
HAROLD Ram it up your ass! 
He realizes at once that his violent side has severely damaged the side of him which is the great seducer. PENELOPE and PAUL are straight as ramrods. 
HAROLD I do beg your pardon. (sincerely) Those words were illy chosen. There is tension in all of us here. Something you must both understand, however, is that the head of this household is home, and he is Harold Ryan, and people do what he says when he says it.  That's the way this particular clock is constructed. 
Lion doorbell roars. 
HAROLD Sometimes even I hate that thing. 
PAUL goes reeling to the door in terror, admits LOOSELEAF, who has also been sleeping in his clothes. 
LOOSELEAF (walking right in) I've been looking at motorcycles. 
HAROLD Go home! 
LOOSELEAF You ever own a motorcycle? 
HAROLD (to PENELOPE) You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take. (to LOOSELEAF) I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home! 
LOOSELEAF Haven't got one. 
PENELOPE (to LOOSELEAF) And you went home unannounced, too? 
LOOSELEAF I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did. 
HAROLD And how were things? 
LOOSELEAF Let's talk about something else. 
PENELOPE (to HAROLD) Alice got married again. 
LOOSELEAF She did? 
PENELOPE You didn't even find that out? 
LOOSELEAF There was so much going on. 
PENELOPE She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum. 
LOOSELEAF So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language. 
HAROLD Otherwise, how are things? 
LOOSELEAF I sure didn't expect her to drop dead. 
PENELOPE Dead! 
LOOSELEAF Jesus. 
PENELOPE (sick) Alice is dead? 
LOOSELEAF No, no--shit no. (stops short) Excuse me, Penelope. 
PENELOPE For what? 
LOOSELEAF For saying "shit." Or is that okay now? 
PENELOPE (shrilly) Who's dead? 
LOOSELEAF My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--

BLACK SCREEN 
On which appears: 
EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE, HAPPENED 
The words slowly FADE OUT, taking us hard into 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN 
A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium. 
SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN 
A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air. 
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
She throws water on her face as the music continues. She looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead. She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day. The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light. 
INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect. 
CHRISTINE Walter...time for school, honey. 
She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair. 
WALTER Just ten more minutes -- 
CHRISTINE Sorry, champ. (more)

CHRISTINE (Cont'd) You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for. Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold. 
WALTER It's cereal, it's supposed to be cold. 
She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again. 
EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING 
A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans. 
INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that only a few other kids have arrived. 
CHRISTINE We're here, sweetie.   Come on. 
She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there. 
She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it rumbles away. 
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once. 
Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper. 
CHRISTINE Okay Sandy, what's the prob-- 
The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.

OPERATOR You deal with this one, I'm not going near it. 
Christine struggles on the headset. 
CHRISTINE Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I -- (checks board) Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I -- (beat) I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by -- (beat) Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone? (beat) Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or -- (beat) Oh. No, I...I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I -- 
She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches. 
MR. HARRIS Everything all right? CHRISTINE Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just someone having a problem with a... with the connection. 
MR. HARRIS Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it. 
CHRISTINE Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me.... 
She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper.

EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY 
Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself. 
Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun. 
She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again. She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.

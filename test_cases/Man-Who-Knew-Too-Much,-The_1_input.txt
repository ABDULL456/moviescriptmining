FADE IN: 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. FULL SHOT 
The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen. The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes. Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in the background. The light is supplied principally from candles. 
As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

A headwaiter, wearing a fez, comes forward.

The headwaiter bows slightly. 
HEADWAITER Bonsoir, Madame, Monsieur. 
BEN Good evening. My name is McKenna. 
HEADWAITER Of course.   The hotel phoned.   Follow me please. 
The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant, The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through her face.

They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.

The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions directly behind those of the two people who stared at them. 
HEADWAITER I think you will find this comfortable. 
He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around as if trying to find another seat. 
JO Ben... 
BEN Sit down, Jo, please.   People are staring at us. 
She sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall and somewhat awkward, has trouble.

First he kneels, and then with much struggle manages to fold his long legs underneath him.

He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his antics, but instead her face is serious, and she has a secret look about her. She leans close to him. 
JO You're right. People are staring at us. 
BEN What people? 
She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns back. 
JO They stared at us when we went into the hotel. 
BEN Jo, will you stop imagining things?

Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind him also turns. They are staring directly at each other. 
MRS. DRAYTON Good evening. 
Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way around toward Jo. 
MRS. DRAYTON You must think me awfully rude. I've been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel. 
Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben. 
MRS. DRAYTON (She peers at Jo) You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway? 
Jo visibly relaxes and becomes Jo Conway. It's Ben's turn to give her a triumphant look in return.

JO Yes, I am. 
Mrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her. 
MRS. DRAYTON Didn't I tell you? I knew I was right.

Another angle, featuring the man, and Ben. 
MRS. DRAYTON I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband. 
DRAYTON How do you do, sir! 
BEN How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs. McKenna. 
DRAYTON My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago. 
MRS. DRAYTON Of course we hardly ever see a show. Edward is such an old stick-in-the- mud. So I have to console myself with your records. 
DRAYTON And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not one for this terrible Bee Bop or whatever you call it. 
JO (Laughs) Thank you, Mr. Drayton. 
MRS. DRAYTON When are you coming back to London? 
JO Possibly never again, professionally. 
MRS. DRAYTON Don't tell me you've given up the stage. 
JO Temporarily. 
BEN It's just that I'm a doctor... Yes. And a doctor's wife...

JO What Ben means is that there are no Broadway musical shows produced in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if we lived in New York... (For Ben's benefit) ...where I hear doctors aren't starving... 
BEN (To Jo) I have nothing against working  in New York. Nothing except the fact   that it's very hard for my patients  to come all the way from Indianapolis  for treatment. 
Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly. 
MRS. DRAYTON Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying the wrong thing. 
JO Not the least, Mrs. Drayton. 
MRS. DRAYTON Tell me; Dr. McKenna do you always.....

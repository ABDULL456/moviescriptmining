Ferris leans forward and adjusts the microphone. 
D.J. He has an incredible story. 
Ferris turns to CAMERA. 
FERRIS I'm going to tell a massive lie here. It's going to by very thick and very steamy. I think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination. Unlike television which provides the images, radio... (pause) You know this. Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio. I have what I consider to be an excellent broadcast voice. I practise it in the bathroom all the time. I used to play records and do introductions to them. But I've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet. I'm going out to several million people so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant groove right now. (clears his voice, speaks into the mike, affects a "radio" voice) Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but...

FERRIS' VOICE ...I'm the first Chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission.

Ferris turns from the mike to CAMERA. 
FERRIS I was going to say I knew Springsteen's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted. After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault. I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird. I'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because I'm not allowed to smoke at home, that I got in the driver's ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and I realized what the hell I was doing and I went to put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway, I was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that I considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost too much. I took it again and passed. But I had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember? 
He turns back to the DJ. 
D.J. How did you get picked for this. 
FERRIS It's kind of a long story but I've been doing alot of programming for NASA.

The Rottweiler is laying unconscious on the lawn. The flower arrangement is scattered all over the yard and the ceramic vase the flowers were in has obviously struck the dog. The broken pieces are all around the dog's head. 
EXT. FERRIS HOUSE. BACKYARD. ROONEY 
He's smiling with great satisfaction. 
ROONEY Sleep tight, pooch. 
He hears something in the house. His head snaps around. He drops down and peek in the windows. 
HIS POV 
A glimpse of a fleeting figure. 
CU. ROONEY 
His eyes dance in anticipation of revenge.

Jeanie kicks the door open. The yardstick flings the covers and the pillows beneath them in the air. She stomps in and turns off the snoring synthesizer.

Jeanie's on the phone. 
JEANIE Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she? This is her daughter. Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back? Do you know anything? 
She slams the phone down. 
JEANIE The worm has luck like clams have body odor... 
She's startled by a noise downstairs. A smile spreads across her face. He's back and she's going to nail him.

Jeanie and Rooney come face-to-face. Jeanie squeals in horror. She doesn't recognize Rooney as himself but as an intruder. She drops into a karate stance and kicks Rooney in the face. He hits the deck. She flees back up the stairs.

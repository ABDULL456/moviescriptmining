The girls SIGH in lazy protest, but still turn off their reading lamps. 
KYLIE'S MOM G'night. 
KYLIE'S SISTER 1                  KYLIE'S SISTER 2 Night, Mom.                     Night. 
EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Kylie's Mom start to close the door. 
KYLIE'S MOM Sleep tight.   Don't let the bed bugs bite. 
Numerous parasites slither INTO FRAME, up the side of the house, approaching the girls' bedroom window, which is open a few inches for air. 
INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely. The girls turn on their sides and close their eyes to sleep. 
And the parasites pour in through the cracked window. They slither over the walls. Their slimy black-red bodies contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper. 
INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The door cracks open, and a parasite enters.   It slithers silently over the linoleum tiles. 
It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side. 
Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed. She doesn't see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet. 
Kylie hears a SOFT SPLASHING and peers down. She spots the creature swimming toward her between her knees. 
Kylie SHRIEKS and scrambles up to get out of the tub.    As she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor. 
The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back. Kylie SHRIEKS again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing off. 
KYLIE Mom!! 
The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it. 
Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there, digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her. 
Kylie falls to her knees. Her eyes roll back in her head, and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the very tip of the parasite's tail. 
We TRACK IN to a CLOSEUP of Kylie's face: a slight white electrical-telepathic charge can be seen SPARKING inside her mouth. 
FLASH TO: 
KYLIE'S VISION 
We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to: 
KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - CREATURE'S POV 
Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth. Its eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and white and amber outlines. Various images FLASH in quick succession, including the following: 
-- We are on top of an alien ANIMAL, pinning it down.    It HOWLS beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting. 
-- All around us, diseased monstrous BEASTS feed on more alien animals. They lunge toward them and pin them down, ripping them apart, like some National Geographic documentary shot in Hell. 
-- In FAST MOTION, unfamiliar plant life around us grows sick and withers, dying out. 
-- A group of diseased monstrous beasts CRY OUT in uniform pain. They buckle to their knees; now they're dying. 
-- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Kylie tries to regain control of her mind. Her eyes fight against flipping back in her head. Tears pour down her face. She pulls the parasite out just a bit. 
But then it SLAMS back into her and there are more SPARKS inside her mouth -- 
KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - MANGLED INSECT POV 
-- We are CLIMBING UP through a creamy, gelatinous yellow. An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him. 
KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - GRANT'S POV 
-- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower. 
-- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face. 
-- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with our tubule. 
-- We see the posse members coming in toward us.

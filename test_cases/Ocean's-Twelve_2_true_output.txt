DANNY What? 
BASHER His title.     It's Spanish.   Mother's cousin. 
102   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S BEDROOM -- DAWN                  102 
Toulour crawls out of bad. Wonders who the woman next to him is. 
103   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY          103 
DANNY He may be the greatest thief in Europe. He may have slept with half of the EU. He may be a Casanova with the soul of a starving artist. It doesn't matter. 
104   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S HALLWAY -- DAWN                  104 
Toulour comes downstairs in his bathrobe. 
105   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN         105 
DANNY There's something he cares about. There's something he can't live without. 
106   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S HOUSE -- DAWN                    106 
Toulour reaches the base of the stairs and stops dead in his tracks. He looks ahead of him to a wall covered with paintings. One painting is clearly missing. 
(CONTINUED) 
106   CONTINUED:                                                  106 
All that remains are the dust/fade marks on the wall to indicate that it had been there. 
He walks up to the wall and smiles -- certainly this will be an interesting day. He's actually been cheered up by this. 
107   EXT. TOULOUR'S VILLA -- DAY                                 107 
Toulour in playing a hard-fought game of tennis. His opponent (EDMUND) bangs a great shot. Toulour gets there and smacks it back. Edmund dives for the ball, just gets it back over the net. But Toulour is waiting and hits a kill shot. 
EDMUNDS Are you on steroids? 
Toulour laughs. 
EDMUND Let's try again. Give me five games this time. 
TOULOUR You are worse than Sampras. You should be paying me. 
A BUTLER arrives. 
BUTLER (in French) Pardon me, sir. 
He hands Toulour two business cards.   One says "Daniel Ocean," the other "Rusty Ryan." 
BUTLER (in French) Two gentlemen. They say they met you in Amsterdam last week. 
TOULOUR (in French) Put them on the veranda and get them a drink. I'll be right up. 
108   EXT. VERANDA -- DAY                                         108 
Danny and Rusty look out over Lake Como. Toulour arrives. 
TOULOUR (to Danny) Rusty. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
108   CONTINUED:                                             108 TOULOUR (cont'd) (to Rusty) Danny. 
DANNY Other way around. 
TOULOUR Are you sure? Usually I'm so good at that. 
Edmund arrives, carrying his tennis bag. 
TOULOUR This is Edmund. Edmund.      Rusty. Danny. 
He calls by their wrong names again. 
DANNY Nice to meet you. Edmund. (making conversation) You a tennis pro? 
Rusty takes a sip of ice tea. 
EDMUND Actually, no, I'm the King of Morocco. 
Danny and Rusty nod, their smiles frozen. 
109   INT. VILLA -- DAY                                      109 
Toulour shows Danny and Rusty his art. 
TOULOUR Sadly, I can't show you my favorite painting of all -- a Degas that used to hang right there -- because it was stolen recently. 
DANNY That's awful. 
RUSTY The criminal element is everywhere these days. 
Toulour nods. 
DANNY Listen, Francois-- 
(CONTINUED) 
109   CONTINUED:                                                 109 
TOULOUR Please. Call me Baron.

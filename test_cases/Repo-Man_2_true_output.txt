LEILA Hello, is Otto there? 
MARLENE It's for you. A girl. 
OTTO Yeah. 
LEILA Hi Otto? It's Leila. 
OTTO Leila who? 
In a bar. 
Duke, Archie, and Debbie enter the bar, checking their weapons at the door. The Circle Jerks are on stage playing When the Shit Hits the Fan. 
OTTO I can't believe I used to like these guys. 
AGENT ROGERSZ Listen to me! For the sake of this and future generations you must tell us everything you know. 
OTTO Yeah. Sure. I need another drink. 
LEILA Otto, these aliens aren't on ice or anything. They could be starting to decay. We've got to find them before they turn into mush. 
DUKE Well! Well! Well! If it ain't the repo man. 
ARCHIE You look like shit (snot) you wankers (weirdos). 
OTTO Duke. Debbi. Archie. I'd like you to meet Leila and her weird friend. 
DUKE How you doing, asshole (airhead)? 
ARCHIE How come you don't hang out with your friends no more? 
[OTTO What friends? 
DUKE Want some toot dude? 
Duke spills his bottle of generic Butyl Nitrate on the table. Debbie and Archie yell and put their noses to the table to sniff it all up. 
DUKE I really love ya man. You're my best friend. Because you always fucking came to see me while I was in Juvie. 
OTTO I'm busy man. I told ya I was working. 
DEBBI Look a metal hand. 
ARCHIE Cool! 
DEBBI Can we feel it?

MA Our friend Table... just isn't able. 
Jack pours the eggs into her bowl of butter and sugar. 
JACK Our friend Spoon, sings to the moon. 
Ma beats the eggs in. 
MA Our friend Knife runs for his life. 
She winces in pain, and shakes out her right wrist. Jack notices and takes over, beating the batter for her.

Later: Ma strings the shells onto the needle tongue of their Eggsnake, made of eggshells crayoned, given paper clothes, foil crowns, colored wool for hair... Eggsnake is hundreds of eggs long.

A little later. The birthday cake is small, brown, plain. Ma makes a 5 with thin white icing. 
MA Abracadabra! 
JACK Now the candles. 
Reading her face, his crumples. 
JACK (CONT'D) You said a birthday cake for real. That means candles on fire. 
MA Jack - 
JACK You should ask for candles for Sunday Treat, not dumb jeans. 
MA Sorry. I have to ask for stuff we really need that he can get easily. 
JACK But Old Nick gets anything, by magic. 
MA Try your cake, I bet it's delicioso. 
But Jack is sulking. She hugs him, quietly soothing him. 
JACK Next week when I'm six you better ask for real candles. 
MA Next year, you mean. 
Later: Half the cake is eaten.

Jack is kneeling at the bath. There's a bucket with dishes in front of him. He's washing up as expertly as an adult.

Later. Steam makes Room mysterious. Jack lies on Ma in the bath, both with bubble moustaches. End of the Selkie story: 
MA But one day the mermaid finds where the fisherman hid her comb. 
JACK Ha ha. 
MA So she runs home to the sea. 
She lets her head and face sink under the water. 
Jack sits up on her, upset. 
Ma emerges and opens her eyes.   Realizes what's wrong. 
MA (CONT'D) Of course she takes her Baby Jack with her. 
JACK Does he drown? 
MA No, he's half-merman. He can breathe air or water, whichever. Satisfied, Jack leans over to scoop up the pile of clothes. 
JACK Laundry Time. 
With relish, he plunges them under the water.

Laundry is hung up to dry everywhere. Ma and Jack are in their sleep t-shirts and underwear. She sits breastfeeding him and telling him a story.

MA ... and Edmond swims and swims to the island of Monte Cristo and digs up all the treasure, and ...

A little later Jack watches as Ma places blankets and a pillow on the floor of the wardrobe. 
JACK Can we have more birthday cake? 
MA Tomorrow. 
JACK Just a bite. 
MA We've brushed our teeth already.

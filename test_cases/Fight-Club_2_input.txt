Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards -- Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking... 
Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up, gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises. 
Jack grabs one of the files off the table. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder. 
EXT. STREET 
Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand, looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him. 
EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER 
Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads toward the BUILDING with the address "1888." 
EXT. 1888 LOBBY 
Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench, runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin! Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package. Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass... 
INT. 1888 LOBBY 
Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the "PARKING" door... 
INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING 
Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS... 
INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR 
Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies, across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED. 
Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it. There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"... 
Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside.. 
TYLER Could be worse... 
Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post. 
TYLER You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be... 
JACK (points at bomb) You... you can't be serious about this. 
TYLER What a ridiculous thing to say. 
JACK I can't let you... 
TYLER ...go through with this? What are you going to do? 
JACK I'm going to... 
TYLER ...stop me? 
JACK I'm not going... 
TYLER ...to let this happen! 
JACK Stop finishing... 
TYLER ...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that. 
Tyler gets up walks to Jack. 
TYLER What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body. 
JACK Since when is Project Mayhem about murder? 
TYLER The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned. 
JACK You don't know that.  There could still be people inside. 
Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms. 
TYLER Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches.  Good riddance. 
Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them. 
TYLER I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order... 
JACK If you know, I know. 
Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires. 
TYLER Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones. 
Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers. 
JACK If I'm wrong, we're both dead.. 
TYLER This is not about martyrdom. 
Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger. 
JACK I'm pulling the green wire. 
TYLER Green?  Did you say green? 
Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look, seems genuinely concerned. 
JACK Yes... 
TYLER Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire. 
JACK Fuck you. 
TYLER I'm serious.  That's the wrong one. 
Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below... 
TYLER Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in the nick of time, eh? 
Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND... 
TYLER See for yourself.

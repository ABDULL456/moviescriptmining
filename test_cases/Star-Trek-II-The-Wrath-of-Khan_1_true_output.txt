Carol's face appears. The image will never be stable for long; sometimes the sound will be covered. 
CAROL Jim... read me? Can you read me? 
KIRK Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong? 
CAROL ... Can't read you... repeat... 
KIRK Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong? 
CAROL ... taking Genesis away from us... 
KIRK Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis? 
CAROL ... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...? 
KIRK What order? Who's taking Genesis? 
CAROL ... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority... 
KIRK Carol! 
CAROL Jim please -- 
But the picture is irrevocably scrambled now. Kirk pounds the Comm in frustration. 
KIRK Uhura! What's happening? Damn it... 
UHURA'S VOICE Transmission jammed at the source, sir. 
KIRK Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.

The activity is normal. The Turbo-Lift opens and Kirk strides in. Bones and Saavik react to the following: 
KIRK Stop engines. 
SULU Stop engines. 
They look wonderingly. Kirk takes a breath -- 
KIRK An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I. (pushes a button) Mr. Scott? 
SCOTTY'S VOICE Aye, sir. 
KIRK We'll be going to warp speed -- 
SCOTTY'S VOICE Aye, sir -- 
SULU (overlapping) Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral... 
KIRK Engage warp engines -- 
SAAVIK (comes out of being stunned) Prepare for warp speed. 
SULU Ready, sir. 
KIRK Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5. 
Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy -- 
57   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK)                     57 
The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing. 
57A   INT. SPOCK'S QUARTERS                                      57A 
Spock is at meditation as Kirk enters quietly. Spock looks up. 
KIRK We've got a problem. 
Spock raises an eyebrow -- 
KIRK (continuing) Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate. 
SPOCK Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves... 
KIRK I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?

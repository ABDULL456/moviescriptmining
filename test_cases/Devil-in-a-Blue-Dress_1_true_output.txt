Disgusted, Easy turns to leave. 
SECURITY GUARD Hold on. 
He sizes up Easy and then points across the courtyard. 
SECURITY GUARD (like an order) Across that way to the left and down the stairs... 
Easy half nods/half glares and walks away. 
13   OMIT                                                           13 
At the other side of the garden Easy turns a corner and heads down concrete steps. At the bottom he opens a door leading into 
14   INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDOR                                       14 
He looks into the boiler room but turns into an empty corridor stopping at a heavy steel door at the end. 
He knocks. After a moment a tall and slight MAN with curly brown hair and the complexion of an East Indian opens the door. 
15   INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM                                          15 
A short and stocky kind of Chinese-looking MAN stands against the door at the far end. The Tall Man ushers Easy into the clutter of heavy metal tools, cans of paint and cleaning solutions. A card table with two chairs sits idly. The Tall Man closes the door and holds out his hand. Easy reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat Easy on his side and Easy pushes him away. 
15   CONTINUED:                                                     15 
EASY Hey, man!    What's wrong with you? 
The Chinese Man slips a hand inside his coat and the Tall Man smiles. 
TALL MAN (with an accent) Mr. Rawlins, put your hands up a little from your sides, please. 
EASY Keep your hands to yourself. I don't let no man feel on me like that. 
The Chinese Man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and takes a step forward, and the Tall Man tries to put his hand against Easy's chest but Easy grabs his wrist. 
TALL MAN Don't worry, Manny. He's okay. Just a little shaky. (indicating the door) Let him know. 
Manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the door behind him. 
After a moment, DeWitt Albright opens up. 
ALBRIGHT (smiling) Easy. 
TALL MAN He doesn't want us to touch him. 
ALBRIGHT Leave it, Shariff. I just wanted to make sure he was solo. 
SHARIFF You're the boss. 
ALBRIGHT You guys can go now. Easy and I have some business. 
16   INT. MAINTENANCE OFFICE                                        16 
Easy follows Albright inside and the big man goes behind a big wooden desk and puts his bone-colored shoes up next to a half full bottle of Wild Turkey. On the other end of the desk a small radio scratches out the Glen Gray Orchestra's "Gotta Be This or That." 
16   CONTINUED:                                                     16 
There is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than that the room is bare. 
ALBRIGHT Have a seat, Mr. Rawlins. 
Easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under Albright's arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching his belt. 
EASY (gesturing back) Your friends, hunh? 
ALBRIGHT Like you, Easy. I need a little help? I give 'em a call... Drink? 
EASY Sure. 
Albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours a fresh one for Easy and fresher one for himself. 
ALBRIGHT One thing I like about working for myself... I always have a bottle on the table... You wanna drink with me? Fine. You don't? Door's right behind you... Joppy tells me you're a war hero... Said you went in with Patton. 
Easy nods, proud but polite, and Albright pushes him a glass of whiskey. 
ALBRIGHT So, you want the job? 
EASY Depends on what kind of job. I don't want to get mixed up in nothing. 
ALBRIGHT Walk out the door in the morning, Easy, and you're mixed up in something. Only thing that matters is if you're mixed up to the top or not. 
16   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               16 
EASY I mean I don't wanna get mixed up with the law... 
ALBRIGHT Neither one of us wants to get mixed up in that. That's just rich people trying to keep me and you in our place. 
He laughs and takes a healthy swig and Easy takes a drink too. 
ALBRIGHT I'm looking for somebody for a friend.

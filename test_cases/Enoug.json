Some are chapter titles, others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons. Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion. At other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles ought to be wilder and less uniform than I suggest on the page. \nHEY HER FACE. FLASHES . She looks gorgeous, then ordinary, sloppy, white waitress uniform, gorgeous again, dishes stacked in her arms, turning, looking, happy, tired. INTERCUT TITLES. \nSLIM Hi, can I help you? What would you like? Want a menu? Hey Billy. Hey Tom. You take care, Rosie. \nWe get a sense of her: 23, smart, good attitude, proud to be on her own and supporting herself even if the job is menial. She moves quickly, physically, with an almost athletic grace - \nSLIM Sure thing, Annie. Have a good one. That's two straight up. You're good to go. Morning. Hey there. Morning to you. (beat, embarrassed) What? (looks down, sees she's carrying lunch food) Right. Afternoon. \nA sense of the diner too. 50's-style joint: hip, lively; a fun pl ace full of wacko signs that tell us we're in some modestly sized So. Cal. beach community. \nSLIM What can I get you? Whattaya like? Whattaya want? (rolls eyes; good-humored rejection of a.come-on:) Nice try, bud - \n(INCREDULOUS) Does that ever work? Hey, lemme get that for you. Hey. Common' right up. \nEND TITLES as we FLASH FOOD IMAGES: beans/eggs/pie/burger/shake /waffle/grilled cheese, fast flow of too much grub as words fly \nUP : \nHOW THEY MET \nINT. \"THE ORCA\" RESTAURANT. DAY. \nFLURRY OF MOVEMENT, WAITRESSES setting up for lunch, Slim joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly offended, working-class accent: \nGINNY Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer... Plus: I have a logical mind... \nSLIM And you're only like 299 thousand short of what you'd need for law school. \nFAST RIFF: \nGINNY I Piece of cake - \nSLIM Piece of pie - \nGINNY Piece of ass. So what would you do? \nSLIM I don't know... \nGINNY \nLIAR - \nSLIM \n(EMBARRASSED) I'm also thinking... well ...I could go back to school. \nGINNY In what? I thought you hated - \nSLIM Psychology maybe, I don't know. I know it's not cool to say so, but I'd like to contribute something to society, even if - (it's just) \nGINNY We contribute. We give 'em food, energy, so they can go out and save Western Civilization - A bell rings, a CUSTOMER comes in, and the owner of the place, PHIL (45, Syrian, also the cook) sticks his head between them: \n", "test1_true": "GINNY Not that we noticed. \n(SEES CLOCK: 11:15) Oh my God, speaking.of time - The lunch rush is coming; they start working triple speed - \nINT. \"ORCA.\" LATER. \nGinny and Slim converge carrying dirty dishes, piling them up for the BUSBOY, TEDDY (21, Hispanic). They haven't stopped moving for two hours, but now they can take a breath, survey the scene. Slim notices Ginny has a wet spot under her arm. \nSLIM Ever try the rock, hey? \nGINNY Excuse me? \nSLIM The deodorant thing. It's salts or something, it comes in like a...it looks like some kinda hippie crystal. \nGINNY You're saying I sweat. \nSLIM Perspire, Ginny. You lightly - \n(PERSPIRE) \nGINNY (a vow to get even) I'll remember that. (as someone comes in) Your turn, I'm sweatin' too much. Slim gives her a look, grabs a menu, goes over to where the new customer, whom we will call for the moment OUR HERO, is seated. \nWhen she reaches his booth, she notices he's got a book and a long-stemmed red rose. She hands him a menu - \nSLIM Waiting for somebody? He shakes his head. She can't help noticing he's very handsome. \nSLIM (CONT. Something to drink? \nOUR HERO Just water, thanks. \nSLIM I'll give you a minute to look over - \nOUR HERO That's okay. I was in yesterday... (reads her nametag) Slim. She nods, slightly uncomfortable. He hands her his menu. \nOUR HERO What's your real name? \nSLIM No. \nOUR HERO Hmm. I like it, but don't you think it's kinds negative? \nSLIM No, I don't tell my name. \nOUR HERO Okay. Coke and a turkey burger, coleslaw no fries, couple extra slices tomato. I write books. \nSLIM Oh. \nOUR HERO You read books? She kind of half-nods half-shrugs. \nOUR HERO (CONT.) What're you reading now? She stares at him... \nSLIM Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce. A friend told me it's the hardest book in the English Language. Not the hardest hardest, just the hardest one it's actually possible to read, and I figure if I can get through that one, I can do the others. \nOUR HERO How long you been reading it? \nSLIM Six years. I'll be back with your \nTB. She leaves, goes back puts the order in, mutters to Ginny: \nSLIM {CONT.} Asshole. \nGINNY What'd he say? \nSLIM Wanted to find out how smart I was so I told him I was reading the hardest book in the English language. \n", "test1_id": 1200, "test2_input": "MITCH'S VOICE \n(FOR DARCELLE) How is my little croissant? \nSLIM It's your loaf of bread. \nMITCH'S VOICE (cheerful, no guilt) Oh. Hi. How's it going? \nSLIM Where are you? \nMITCH'S VOICE Zoo. \nSLIM Why didn't you tell me you were going to - (pick up Gracie) \nMITCH'S VOICE I called you at home, left messages - He's interrupted by a LOUD SQUEAL from Gracie, followed by a question, which he answers: \nMITCH'S VOICE (CONT.) Your Mom. \nGRACIE'S VOICE Hey Moml The elephants are peeing! \nMITCH'S VOICE (pleased with himself for being a good Dad) She's a little excited. \nSLIM When are you coming home? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT. \nDinner. It's scary that Mitch will have this conversation in front of Gracie, who's playing at their feet: \nMITCH It made me nervous when I couldn't reach you. Slim shrugs. He stares at her. Smiles. His voice so soft and calm: \nMITCH {CONT.} Do you have any idea how bad things can get? \nSLIM Educate me. \nMITCH (embarrassed to say it) Slim. I'm a determined person. I was determined to have you, and I did. This house...the company...I am, and always will be, a person who gets what he wants. You can either share in my success or leave us (meaning him and Gracie) right now. Which way you wanna go? Beat. \nSLIM I want to be happy. He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt : \nMITCH Good. With a sudden shock, Slim sees Gracie staring at Mitch: the girl has picked up on his tone. Slim glances at Mitch to see if he notices Gracie's expression. He doesn't. \nSlim looks back at Gracie: still staring at Mitch. If she already senses what's happening, how long before she's affected by it? How long before she sees Mitch become violent? Slim's jaw tightens slightly; her resolve grows stronger. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nMitch asleep, Slim awake, listening. His breathing deep, rhythmic, slight hint of a snore. In the distance, a DOVE coos. She looks at her clock: 2:15. She eases out of bed. Goes into the bathroom. We hear the sound of her peeing. \nINT. BATHROOM. \nShe's no peeing. A BOTTLE is propped up, running water into the toilet as Slim gets dressed. Quickly, silently. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nShe leans out the bathroom doorway, sees: he's still asleep. She moves quickly, bathroom to hall. \nINT. GRACIE'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nGracie's fast asleep. Slim lifts her up, piles her prized teddy bear on top. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT. \n", "test2_true": "She reaches the front door. Waits to make sure all is quiet. It is. She turns, looks back down the hall. Empty. Reaches toward the doorknob... hand closer, closer... she starts to turn it - \nEXT. SLIM'S HOUSE. NIGHT. \nGinny, Phil, and Teddy are clustered under a tree, staring at the house. Waiting. Their VAN is parked down the road. We expect the front door to open any instant. It doesn't. They wait. Casually. Not knowing where Slim was. But we know. Did something go wrong? Slim was right at the door. In a casual way, her rescuers start to wonder. \nTEDDY Maybe she didn't hear the signal. \nGINNY She heard it. \nPHIL No. Teddy's right. She could still be asleep - \nGINNY She's not asleep, okay? She's coming out any second. Phil nods. They wait. She does not come out. Ginny shakes her head, looks at her watch. \nGINNY Do it again. Teddy nods. Cups his hands, coos like a dove... They wait again. Beat. \nINT. HOUSE. NIGHT. \nSlim still frozen in exactly the same spot. Still carrying Gracie, still with her hand on the knob. Listening. Turning her head this way-that way. She hears the COOING DOVE NOISE come again from outside. That settles it. She pulls the door - \nMITCH FLYING AT HER - Grabs her, catches her, catches Gracie, pulling Slim's hair hard, leading her away from the door - \nEXT. HOUSE. NIGHT. \nThe three rescuers still wait. Frozen. Phil shakes his head. We see a baseball bat in his hands. \nPHIL We better go in. \nGINNY It'd be crazy to wake him. If anything's wrong, she'll flick the lights. .Right? Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure. They look at the house-and wait. . .and wait... We want to scream: \"GO IN! GO! SAVE HER!\" Suddenly something. Subtle. Was that A SOUND from inside??? They go on alert. . .step forward... listen more closely... But hear nothing unusual. \nPhil. looks at Ginny, shrugs - Ginny shrugs back - FLASH OF LIGHT, then darkness. The signal. They run toward the house - SCREAM. Slim. Intense horrible spit of sound, replaced by an even more horrible silence. Deadly silence. CLOSE ON GINNY as they run: as if we've lost Slim and Ginny's.our new protagonist. As we near the house, we realize: it's not silence. There are sounds from inside: almost inaudible THUDS. Sound of a beating. On Ginny's horrified reaction - Baseball bat. Phil smashes a window. They climb through the hole into the house - \nINT. HOUSE. NIGHT. \nSilence. They move quickly, carefully toward the living room; it's very dark, we can hardly - \nMITCH Another step and you're dead. Mitch emerges from darkness. Light glints off his pistol. Thirty feet behind him: Gracie's sleeping on the couch. Mitch moves and they stare in horror. Lying at his feet is Slim's body.. Pain springs from Ginny's throat, she rushes to Slim - Mitch rams the gun into her head: \nMITCH Didn't you hear me?i Ginny feels Slim's pulse, says to Phil: \nGINNY She's alive - \nMITCH Unless you go, your brains'11 be on imy rug i \nPHIL Sir. We are three people. If you kill us all, you will go sure to electric chair. \nMITCH I could give a shit. Slim makes a SOUND as Ginny strokes her head... Mitch FIRES the gun into the wall over Ginny's head. Muffled sound: silencer. But he has everyone's attention now: \nMITCH (CONT.) This is your last chance. \nPHIL We are happy to leave, Sir: with Miss Slim and Gracie. Ginny's helping Slim to her knees. \nPHIL (CONT.) And make no mistakes. If you keep them here, we will go to police, who will arrest you with pleasure. \nI/ Mitch stares at Phil. Walks to him. Is he going to hit him? Shoot him? Mitch leans in, gun to Phil's head, and whispers: \nMITCH I don't want to say this in front of the group, but you're just a rug-head, nobody'll believe you. You go to the cops, it's her word against mine. They'll find drugs in her bureau... (before Phil can laugh) Or her car, whatever. \n(VERY STRONG) Trust me on that. (casual, confident) I'll have custody of Gracie by the end of the week. \nPHIL \n(SKEPTICAL) And if we take them away, you will shoot all four of us?? \n", "test2_id": 1201, "test3_input": "JOE I look forward to that. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK. DAY. \nBaseball diamond. Joe pitching underhand to \"Queen E.\" He's using plastic balls the size of soccer balls, so it's easy for her to hit every one. \"Erin\" is running, retrieving the hits. FREEZE FRAME as she's caught in a photograph. The image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of frozen frames, photographs of her, some wide, some tight. \nREVERSE IMAGE. The park. Mostly empty. No one taking their picture. A stand of green bushes. HOLD on the bushes for a moment - \nEXT. PARK. AN HOUR LATER. \n\"Queen E.\" is curled on a blanket taking a nap as \"Erin\" and Joe finish the picnic. \nJOE You seem like you're doing great. \n\"ERIN\" Yeah. \nJOE How long can you stand it? (off her look) I mean: not to talk to your friends or family or have anything to do with your real life? \n\"ERIN\" (quiet, strong) Gracie is safe. \nJOE Yeah, but what, now Mitch started some kind of custody battle?, what \nDOES - \nROBBIE Are you Denise? SHOCK. There he is, standing right over them, in bad clothes and a baseball cap, dark glasses. Completely unrecognizable. \n\"ERIN\" Pardon me? \nROBBIE You're Denise, right? Used to work at the Pack 'N' Ship? \n\"ERIN\" I'm not Denise. \nROBBIE Oh. Sorry, I... You look-but you're right, your voice... (isn't) You're not from New Zealand, are you? \n\"ERIN\" Never been there. \nROBBIE Boy. Sorry to bother you folks. He backs away, embarrassed. Joe stares after him warily... \nJOE What now? We call Pack 'N' Ship, see if Denise ever - (worked there) \n\"ERIN\" Because of some homeless guy? Joe: it could be the Pack'N'Ship in Trenton, New Jersey. (over his protest) One thing I learned: I can't jump every time someone says boo. I can't do that to her. \nJoe looks at \"Queen E.\" and nods. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \nLooks peaceful. But why do we need this establishing shot? Its very existence in the narrative is menacing. \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \nJoe gets up from \"Queen E. 's\" bed and goes into the kitchen. Gets some juice from the fridge, drinks it. Looks into \"Erin's\" bedroom. \"Erin\" is awake, \"Queen E.\" asleep at her side. Half -whisper: \nJOE Gracie was right. (off her look) 'Bout the dreams in there. \n\"ERIN\" Yeah, mine too. \n(BEAT) Cuddle? \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" BEDROOM. NIGHT. \n", "test3_true": "\"ERIN\" You remember the house rules? \nJOE With Gracie here? Who can forget? They hold hands. \n\"ERIN\" Joe. \nJOE Yeah. \n\"ERIN\" You ever think about what would've happened...(if you and I had...) \nJOE Yeah. \n\"ERIN\" What do you think? Beat. \nJOE I think Gracie is truly a great kid, and any path that doesn't include her doesn't make any sense. \"Erin\" nods. Beat. \n\"ERIN\" Ginny told me about that weekend. \nJOE Of your wedding? She nods. \nJOE She tell you how terrible I was? \n\"ERIN\" Joe. This routine? It might work on other people, but you forget: I've actually had you - \nJOE I didn't forget - \n\"ERIN\" (like a compliment's coming) - and I'm telling you, from memory... \n(DRY TEASE) you are not that bad... They both laugh. It subsides into affection... \n\"ERIN\" You really go tomorrow...? He nods. \n\"ERIN\" (CONT.) Couldn't you quit your job, and stay here and play the horses or something and become independently wealthy? \nBeat. \nJOE Please kiss me, Slim. I know we're not supposed to, it's against house rules and all, but for me to come all this way and feel the way I do and for us to not even - She kisses him - And he kisses back. And they stop. Incredible self control. Lie next to each other-hold hands again... \nJOE You're a great person, Slim. You're a great person just like your daughter. She squeezes his hand. THE CAMERA LINGERS FOR A MOMENT ON THIS SWEET IMAGE... clasped hands...THEN PULLS SUDDENLY BACK, so we're seeing their hands from outside, through a crack in the window. Hold. \nCUT TO: YOU CAN RUNs s s \nEXT. PRESCHOOL. DAY. \nFrom an odd distance across the street, we watch \"Erin\" dropping off \"Queen E.\" Extend the mundane details of this transaction... THREE DAYS LATER \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \nT.T. sticks her head in, to \"Erin\": \nT.T. I know you have a \"back room\" gig, but with Sher out, four customers: I need help here; I'm on meltdown. \nEXT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \nWe look. past a tree, through the windows...as \"Erin\" comes warily out to the counter, looks over the customers... \nINT. DOUBLE A RENT-A-CAR. COUNTER. LATER. DAY. \n\"Erin\" working a calculator, muttering in frustration... \nT.T. Here, lemme do that. As T.T. wrestles with the calculation, \"Erin\" looks up. Frowns slightly, her eyes shift... She senses something. This strange sensation, as if she's being watched, or... She looks out the window, doesn't see anyone... Glances into the back office - and notices the clock: 4:15. \n\"ERIN\" (runs for door) Oh my Godl, the Queen is out of dance class! I'll be back in 20 - \n", "test3_id": 1202}

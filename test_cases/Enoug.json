{"train": "ENOUGH \nWritten by \nNicholas Kazan \nREVISED - 3B \nDialog in parenthesis is (not spoken aloud). \nNOTE ON TITLES: GRAPHIC TITLES pop up throughout. Some are chapter titles, others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons. Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion. At other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles ought to be wilder and less uniform than I suggest on the page. \nHEY HER FACE. FLASHES . She looks gorgeous, then ordinary, sloppy, white waitress uniform, gorgeous again, dishes stacked in her arms, turning, looking, happy, tired. INTERCUT TITLES. \nSLIM Hi, can I help you? What would you like? Want a menu? Hey Billy. Hey Tom. You take care, Rosie. \nWe get a sense of her: 23, smart, good attitude, proud to be on her own and supporting herself even if the job is menial. She moves quickly, physically, with an almost athletic grace - \nSLIM Sure thing, Annie. Have a good one. That's two straight up. You're good to go. Morning. Hey there. Morning to you. (beat, embarrassed) What? (looks down, sees she's carrying lunch food) Right. Afternoon. \nA sense of the diner too. 50's-style joint: hip, lively; a fun pl ace full of wacko signs that tell us we're in some modestly sized So. Cal. beach community. \nSLIM What can I get you? Whattaya like? Whattaya want? (rolls eyes; good-humored rejection of a.come-on:) Nice try, bud - \n(INCREDULOUS) Does that ever work? Hey, lemme get that for you. Hey. Common' right up. \nEND TITLES as we FLASH FOOD IMAGES: beans/eggs/pie/burger/shake /waffle/grilled cheese, fast flow of too much grub as words fly \nUP : \nHOW THEY MET \nINT. \"THE ORCA\" RESTAURANT. DAY. \nFLURRY OF MOVEMENT, WAITRESSES setting up for lunch, Slim joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly offended, working-class accent: \nGINNY Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer... Plus: I have a logical mind... \nSLIM And you're only like 299 thousand short of what you'd need for law school. \nFAST RIFF: \nGINNY I Piece of cake - \nSLIM Piece of pie - \nGINNY Piece of ass. So what would you do? \nSLIM I don't know... \nGINNY \nLIAR - \nSLIM \n(EMBARRASSED) I'm also thinking... well ...I could go back to school. \nGINNY In what? I thought you hated - \nSLIM Psychology maybe, I don't know. I know it's not cool to say so, but I'd like to contribute something to society, even if - (it's just) \nGINNY We contribute. We give 'em food, energy, so they can go out and save Western Civilization - A bell rings, a CUSTOMER comes in, and the owner of the place, PHIL (45, Syrian, also the cook) sticks his head between them: \nGINNY He likes you. \nSLIM I think he's just a dick. \nGINNY Slim...he was in yesterday - \nSLIM I know - \nGINNY And he's back today with a rose, he pulls you into conversation. Honey, if you can't tell he likes you, you need to study psychology. \nSLIM Okay, so he likes me. \nGINNY Do you like him? \nSLIM I don't know him. \nGINNY What's that got to do with it? Slim: he is a major piece of cake/piece of pie. \nSLIM I didn't notice. \nGINNY Trust me. Carrot cake. And when a guy like that - cuter than you? - he actually likes you - \nSLIM He's cuter than me?? tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favorite \nROUTINE: \nGINNY Hey. Wise up, huh? No-one is ever gonna go for you 'cause of your looks. \nSLIM \n(NODS SOBERLY) That is bad news, 'cause my personality bites. Ginny grins. Slim writes up a check for a CUSTOMER at the counter. When she finishes, the turkey burger is up. She carries it to the table: \nSLIM TB, coleslaw, and so forth. You don't really write books, do you? \nOUR HERO Nope. \nSLIM I don't read Finnecan's Wake either. \nOUR HERO I'm goin' into law. Enforcement. She nods. This is more like what she expected. \nSLIM Who's the rose for? He shrugs. She's busy, so she starts to go: \nSLIM Enjoy your grub, huh? She's seven feet away when she hears: \nOUR HERO \nHEY - Sheturns back toward him - He smiles, offers the rose: \nOUR HERO You. She smiles back-their eyes meet... a sudden utterly magical moment. This is also the moment to.note OUR HERO should be played by a famous actor doing a cameo. Because at this instant the scene changes. The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns and looks at Slim. Stands. Looks down at Our Hero... \nMITCH How much did you settle on? \nOUR HERO Excuse. me? Slim frowns, steps closer so she can overhear: \nMITCH The bet. How much is it? Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face - \nMITCH (CONT.) You and your friend. Yesterday. Was it 200 or 500 or - ? \nSLIM \n(TO MITCH) What're you - \nMITCH He bet his friend he could get in your pants in less than twelve hours, starting noon today. Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger - \nGINNY Why am I not believing this? \n(INTRIGUED) Can I take you home right now? \nJOE If you've got a sense of humor. \nGINNY My kids are out for the night, and... \nJOE Another thing: I live in Chicago; women always want the possibility of \nLONG-TERM - \nGINNY I didn't propose, huh? I just want to have... (looks at him...) a brief and completely unsatisfying sexual encounter. \nJOE Hey. I'm your guy. She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser... We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly: tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him... \nSLIM You sure,you love me? \nMITCH Uh-huh... \nSLIM For ever and ever? He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions: \nMITCH You're safe with me, Slim. You're safe, and it's okay to be happy. We deserve it. They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over, waits. When they break: \nPHIL I'm sorry, I gotta get up five o'clock to buy green beans. He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand: \nPHIL In my country, it's tradition to give money to groom. You don't need it, but... Slim shakes her head, touched, as: \nMITCH That's very sweet - \nSLIM \n(HUGGING PHIL) Thanks for giving me away, okay? You're the best substitute Dad a girl could possibly have. \nPHIL No substitute. I am real thing. She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him. \nMITCH He really loves you. She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away. Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers: \nMITCH You gonna give me babies? \nSLIM Oh yeah. \nMITCH How soon? \nSLIM How soon can we get out of here? He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor. Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true... \nCUT TO: \nCONQUERING HERO \nEXT. SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE WITH GROUNDS. DAY. \nSlim (4 months pregnant) stands'on the walkway leading up to a large, simple,' beautiful house. Mitch is knocking at the door. The man who answers the door is 62, white-haired, vigorous. Looks like he walked out of a Viagra ad. \nHOME OWNER Hello? \nMITCH Hi. We've been driving around, and my wife has completely fallen in love with your house. \nHOME OWNER It's great, isn't it? \nMITCH We want to buy it. The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulging \nWIFE: \nKnocking her to the ground. Stands over her like a boxer. Sees rase flare across her face - \nMITCH You want to fight? I'm a mom, honey; it's no contest. She's silent, but we see (very small) her reaction: Oh yeah?? \nMITCH {CONT.} You have to understand, Slim. I thought you did: make the money here, so I set the rules, right? It's my rules. He waits for her response, but again she's silent. \nMITCH You with me? \nSLIM It's your rules. \nMITCH Yeah. She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend: \nSLIM And if I don't like the rules?? \nMITCH If you don't \"like\" them?! She nods cautiously. \nMITCH {CONT.} Come on. Life isn't onl stuff we like. We take the good with the bad, right? That's what life is, what marriage is. So maybe, for you, today is a bad day. Tomorrow may be great. \nSLIM Tomorrow may be great. \nMITCH That's right. \nSLIM Tomorrow will be great. (Without you . ) He appears to miss her inference. \nMITCH Yeah. Today is the price you pay for having such a good life. She stares at him. \nMITCH I'm going out. She says nothing. \nMITCH {CONT.} This is gonna be better, don't you think? She just cannot process the absurdity of this statement. \nMITCH {CONT.} I don't have to sneak around, pretend I'm going to work. I can just say: \"I'm going to Darcelle's, I'll be back in a few hours.\" Her face is completely blank. He bends down, gives her a kiss on the head. We feel her skin crawl. She watches him go. Waits. Hears the front door close. She gets up, walks to the window, watches him walk toward his car. She turns away, looks at the room. We HEAR his car start. She goes to the phone. Thinks. Starts to dial-slowly, deliberately... Shock: RAP AT THE WINDOW! He's there. \nShe reacts with guilt, but he doesn't look angry now. Behind him is his idling Mercedes convertible, driver's door open... He motions for her to open the window. She does. \nMITCH Who you calling? \nSLIM Your mother. \nMITCH What're you gonna tell her? \nSLIM I'm supposed to bring Gracie tomorrow. Maybe I better cancel. \nMITCH \n(NODS) I was thinking. You...you know that I adore you, but if you ever want...if you want out... For a second he can't talk. He's choked up. She watches coldly. His emotion appears real, but who cares? \nMITCH (CONT.) .I'll understand. I really will. \n(ALMOST TENDER) But there's one thing: you can't have Gracie. She's my daughter. Don't even think about taking her. Slim stares at him. He adds calmly: \nMITCH (CONT.) If I see that thought even cross your mind, I'll kill you. There. He's said what he needs to. He walks toward his car. She shuts the window. Stares after him. In an odd and defiant way, she starts to whistle. Loudly. To herself. Almost daring him. \nHe keeps walking. \nCUT TO: \nOUTTA HERE \nINT. CAR. DAY. \nEmotional, impressionistic. CLOSE ON her face, almost inside her skin: a visual symphony. The countryside behind her is out of focus, a blur. She pulls up at a gate, punches in a code. Drives up a long a driveway to: \nEXT. PASADENA ESTATE. DAY. \nMITCH'S VOICE \n(FOR DARCELLE) How is my little croissant? \nSLIM It's your loaf of bread. \nMITCH'S VOICE (cheerful, no guilt) Oh. Hi. How's it going? \nSLIM Where are you? \nMITCH'S VOICE Zoo. \nSLIM Why didn't you tell me you were going to - (pick up Gracie) \nMITCH'S VOICE I called you at home, left messages - He's interrupted by a LOUD SQUEAL from Gracie, followed by a question, which he answers: \nMITCH'S VOICE (CONT.) Your Mom. \nGRACIE'S VOICE Hey Moml The elephants are peeing! \nMITCH'S VOICE (pleased with himself for being a good Dad) She's a little excited. \nSLIM When are you coming home? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT. \nDinner. It's scary that Mitch will have this conversation in front of Gracie, who's playing at their feet: \nMITCH It made me nervous when I couldn't reach you. Slim shrugs. He stares at her. Smiles. His voice so soft and calm: \nMITCH {CONT.} Do you have any idea how bad things can get? \nSLIM Educate me. \nMITCH (embarrassed to say it) Slim. I'm a determined person. I was determined to have you, and I did. This house...the company...I am, and always will be, a person who gets what he wants. You can either share in my success or leave us (meaning him and Gracie) right now. Which way you wanna go? Beat. \nSLIM I want to be happy. He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt : \nMITCH Good. With a sudden shock, Slim sees Gracie staring at Mitch: the girl has picked up on his tone. Slim glances at Mitch to see if he notices Gracie's expression. He doesn't. \nSlim looks back at Gracie: still staring at Mitch. If she already senses what's happening, how long before she's affected by it? How long before she sees Mitch become violent? Slim's jaw tightens slightly; her resolve grows stronger. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nMitch asleep, Slim awake, listening. His breathing deep, rhythmic, slight hint of a snore. In the distance, a DOVE coos. She looks at her clock: 2:15. She eases out of bed. Goes into the bathroom. We hear the sound of her peeing. \nINT. BATHROOM. \nShe's no peeing. A BOTTLE is propped up, running water into the toilet as Slim gets dressed. Quickly, silently. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nShe leans out the bathroom doorway, sees: he's still asleep. She moves quickly, bathroom to hall. \nINT. GRACIE'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nGracie's fast asleep. Slim lifts her up, piles her prized teddy bear on top. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT. \nMITCH That's right. \nPHIL Then we die young. The others are uncertain, but Phil helps Slim up; Teddy joins him. Ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up Gracie.. \nSLIM \n(VERY SOFT) (This is no good.) You're humiliating him. \nGINNY What? \nSLIM (a little louder) He'll come after me and kill me. Mitch overhears this, smiles. \nMITCH You hear that? That's why she loves me. (off their horrified looks) Nobody cares like I do. The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward the door. Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers: \nMITCH See you soon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. VAN. NIGHT. \nGracie awake now in Slim's arms: staring, confused. Gentle rocking of the van. The others barely visible, like shadows. \nCHECK, PLEASE \nINT. AIRPLANE. DAY. \nGracie asleep, Slim holding her. Blinds down, movie playing. Despite Gracie's age, the angle and soft lighting make this resemble a Madonna and child... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NAVY PIER (CHICAGO). EVENING. \nOpen air market: shops, stalls; yuppie heaven. Slim carries Gracie on her shoulders. They're with Jog (her old boyfriend, from the wedding). Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie eating a pastry. They stop and look out at Lake Michigan. \nSLIM Wow ... whattaya think, Toots? \nGRACIE It's a big ocean! \nJOE Well. It's only a lake, but we like it. \nGRACIE (nods, stares out... Can we stay here a while? \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOE'S CAR. NIGHT. \nThey're driving along, suddenly Joe says - \nJOE Coming up, whattaya say?! \nGRACIE & SLIM \n(A GAME) Bobbing for apples! Slim (front seat) and Gracie (back) both drop their heads so they can't be seen from outside the car - Joe turns the corner, presses a garage door opener, and drives into the basement garage of a nice-looking 4-plex. \nINT. JOE'S 4-PLEX. NIGHT. \nThey come in from the garage, throw off their coats. All the curtains in the apartment are drawn. \nJOE Is there anybody who likes ice cream? Gracie whoops - The doorbell rings - \nSlim and Joe freeze - Slim whips her hand over Gracie's mouth - Gracie looks horrified: why are you covering my - Slim puts her finger to her mouth: shhh. She takes Gracie's hand; they scurry out of sight - Joe hurries to the stereo, puts it on. Music to cover Gracie's \"whoop . \" He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole. Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT. \nJOE Yes? \n\"THIRD FBI MAN\" (stopping his search) Oh please, John Boy. Not the shiv \nAGAIN - \n\"FIRST FBI MAN\" I'm just going to cut him a little - Slim's eyes bulge - \n\"THIRD FBI MAN\" You are not going to cut him! \n\"FIRST FBI MAN\" I sure as hell am! Slim's on the verge of bursting out when \"Second FBI\" enters: \n\"SECOND FBI MAN\" John Boy, this is not listed on the program. Come on, they're not here; let's ride. \n\"FIRST FBI MAN\" Can't I just - (cut him a little} \n\"SECOND FBI MAN\" No! No slice and dice! They head for the door. As he goes, \"First FBI Man\" (a.k.a. John Boy) runs his knife along the couch, spilling out its contents... .passes the tv set and stabs the tube... .runs his knife along the wall, making a vicious scary mark. And they vanish. We hear the door SLAM. The horizontal band through which Slim was looking widens - \nThe cabinet door falls open, Slim and Gracie come out. Gracie's crying. Slim hugs her, says to Joe: \nSLIM Jesus, are you okay? \nJOE I guess. (feels his neck) I needed a shave, anyway. The phone rings. They look at it. It can't be who they think it is... it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers: \nJOE Hello? \nMITCH'S VOICE This is Mitch Tyler, Joe. \nJOE Hello, yes, how are you? Joe points at phone: \"It's him.\" He nods toward Gracie, indicating Slim should take her into the next room. Slim does. \nMITCH'S VOICE (calm, friendly) I assume Slim's called you. Joe thinks for a split second, then: \nJOE Of course. \nMITCH'S VOICE Will you give her a message? (off his silence) If she calls again, I mean. Slim and Gracie are in the next room, but Slim's looking through the door back at Joe. \nJOE I don't know. I'm on her side here, not yours. \nMITCH'S VOICE Her side? Come on, Joe, you're a smart person. Let me say two words, okay? \"Lug nuts.\" You don't want to worry they're loose every time you get in your car. And how 'bout the windows to your apartment: are they still locked? A person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that. \nJOE Goodbye, Mitch. \nMITCH'S VOICE Tell her to call her friends. Joe hangs up. Slim comes back out. \nJOE Wow. Charming. \nSLIM He scare you? Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her question. \nSLIM {CONT.} I shouldn't be here - \nJOE Sure you should - \nSLIM I'm dangerous to know right now. \nJOE (calm, forceful) Slim. You can be here anytime. She nods. They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also). \nJOE (CONT.) Oh. He said you should call your friends. \nSLIM At the restaurant? \nMOMENTS LATER. Slim on the phone, listening as the phone rings. And again, again. Joe watching her, concerned. Finally: \nGINNY'S VOICE Awright already! Orcal \nSLIM Hey. Gin. You okay? \nJUPITER It's a good gig. To claim I'm your father? What year were you born? \nSLIM You are my Dad, Jupiter. When Mom died, I wrote you, you didn't answer. I didn't have enough money to bury her, that was really fun. \nJUPITER Don't look at me, I didn't kill her. \nSLIM No, you had help. \nJUPITER That's a stupid thing to say. What do you want, money?. \nSLIM I thought you should meet your granddaughter. \nJUPITER (perfunctory, to Gracie) Hi. Gracie looks at him skeptically, nods. \nSLIM And yes, we need money. To survive. \nJUPITER Look sweetheart. From '68 to like '72, I had maybe 5 kids. Different women. It was like a joke to me. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 SLIM It's like a joke to me too. \nJUPITER You're the third to show up here with a hand out. I give all of you the same thing. (taking it from his wallet) Six bucks. Enough for a sandwich. For you, it's' twelve, you can buy the kid a sandwich too. \nSLIM (stunned...} Well. Now I know. \nJUPITER Yeah. \nSLIM Used to be if I did something nasty, my temper got the better of me?, I'd wonder where the hell it came from. Thanks for clearing that up. \nJUPITER No problem. She goes, leaving the $12 on the table. He pockets it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO ALLEY. DAY. \nSlim stands behind Jupiter's building. In the shadows. Still carrying Gracie. It's only after we hear Gracie - \nGRACIE Don't cry, Mom. Please don't cry. - that we realize Slim is crying. \nGRACIE (CONT.) You have mtg. Beat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRAIN STATION. SANTA BARBARA. NIGHT. \nSlim and Gracie climb off the train and are immediately shepherded away by TWO SWARTHY MEN in Hawaiian shirts - \nSLIM Wait. Wait. What're you...? Who're you...? \nGRACIE \n(WORRIED) Mommy? One of the Swarthy Men speaks to Slim, but in the flurry, we can't hear it. She looks relieved, turns to Gracie - - but before Slim can speak, their bags are thrown in the trunk of a car and they're pushed into the back seat - The car speeds off, whips into a left-hand turn - \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA. ANOTHER STREET. NIGHT. \nNow the car makes a right-hand turn, and a TRUCK pulls out, blocking traffic so no one can follow them - \nINT. CAR. NIGHT. \nSlim looks out the back, sees the Truck's maneuver. Turns to face forward again. Tries to meet the Driver's eyes. \nSLIM Hello? Where are we going? The Driver answers her in a Middle-Eastern language. Gracie looks alarmed. \nSLIM It's okay, Sweetheart, they're friends of Phil's. (I think.) \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. BACK ROOM. DAY. \nMustapha working at one desk, \"Erin\" at another. Gracie on the floor, coloring. Bored. Prompts a look from \"Erin\" - \n\"ERIN\" Look. I have to find the right place and get you admitted, okay? \nINT. DRAB HOUSE. NIGHT. \n15 people being served from a large pot. \"Erin\" and Gracie each get a good portion of something that looks quite unusual. \n\"ERIN\" Thank you. \nGRACIE Thank you. (looks at it, whispers) What j it? \n\"ERIN.\" Food. \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \n\"Erin\" works at her desk. Gracie shoots paper basketballs- into the wastebasket.. stops as Mustapha enters. He gives \"Erin\" an open FedEx pack. \nMUSTAPHA FedEx is like underground railroad. \"Erin\" is stunned. She looks inside the package, finds another FedEx pack. Opens that. Inside it is a wrapped present and note. She reads: \nJUPITER'S VOICE \"Dear Daughter - (CONT.) \nINT. JUPITER'S OFFICE. DAY. \nJupiter's at his desk as the THREE \"FBI MEN\" are shown in. He says something gracious to them. For. a moment they don't respond. Then one of them speaks. \nWhatever he's saying produces a subtle but profound change on Jupiter's features. \nJUPITER'S VOICE (CONT.) Yesterday three men threatened to kill me if I helped you in any way. Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest. (CONT.) \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \n\"Erin\" opens the present and finds: Cash. Fifties. Probably a couple thousand dollars. She fights the impulse to cry. \nJUPITER'S VOICE (CONT.) I'm sending this via your former boss. If you get it and need more, leave word at my office. \nJUPITER\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT./INT. SMALL PRETTY HOUSE. DAY. \nFLASHES: Arab Men carrying in a couch as \"Erin\" watches. \"Erin\" hanging sheets over the windows: makeshift curtains. \"Erin\" fixing Gracie's room. Small bed. Two new Teddy Bears. \n\"ERIN\" What do you think, you like this place? \nGRACIE \n(SUSPICIOUSLY) Why, are we moving again? \n\"ERIN\" No, we just - (got here) \nGRACIE Good. 'Cause I am sick and tired to death of movingi \n\"ERIN\" Me too. So here's the deal. Try to remember,. while we're here, to call me Mom or Erin, but not Slim, okay? \nGRACIE I never call you Slim. \n\"ERIN\" I know, but... \nGRACIE I don't think you are that slim. \n\"ERIN\" We can't afford to eat out every night. I can cook, Tootster. \"Queen E.\" rolls her eyes as: \nBRAD Hi. (off her blank look) I'm Brad Zall, I just rented a car from you guys. \"Erin\" stares at him. An insane moment of sustained paranoia. Who is this guy,. really? What does he want? Finally she realizes a normal response is required. Kind of a \nTRICK QUESTION: \n\"ERIN\" Is the vehicle all right? \nBRAD Yeah, it's fine. I was just thinking that if you're not doing anything, maybe I could buy you - and the kid of course - \n\"ERIN\" Who are you?! Who sent you?! You want a date?! You are totally out of your mind if you think I'm gonna have even this conversation we're having right now! I'm not, okay?! We are not talking! Get it?! \nBRAD Yeah, I get it. And good luck with your psychotherapy. He walks away. She stares after him. Again \"Queen E.\" is looking at her mother in astonishment. \nSUP \n\"ERIN\" \n(STILL AGGRESSIVE) What? You're thinking I over- reacted? Huh? Just a little? \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" TAURUS. DAY. \n\"Erin\" driving too fast. Her slight recklessness adds an undercurrent of anxiety to the scene. She's also eating doughnuts, sharing a box with her daughter. They pass a gas station. \"Queen E.\" sees pay phones. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" You know Mom? I like the doughnuts and all, but the driving... \n\"ERIN\" Don't get on my case. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Every Sunday, to drive for 55 hours? In exasperation, \"Erin\" gestures with both hands - taking them off the wheel. Nothing bad happens, but again her recklessness makes us nervous - \n\"ERIN\" It's not 55 - \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Just to reach some phone booth?! Hey can I call Daddy this time?! Please??? Please please please... \"Erin\" shakes her head. \"Queen E.\" gives her a mournful look. \n\"ERIN\" Don't beg. You look like a dog. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTRY STORE. DAY. \n\"Erin\" is on the phone, \"Queen E.\" at her side. \n\"ERIN\" Mrs. Tyler? It's Slim. \nMRS. TYLER'S VOICE Oh thank God. Listen. Mitch is planning some legal action, you're depriving him of his rights as a father, some nonsense like that: you better have Gracie call him. \n\"ERIN\" Oh that's good news - \nMRS. TYLER'S VOICE I thought you'd want to know - \n\"ERIN\" I do, thanks, I appreciate it. Listen: we have to keep it short again or he might trace it, so I better put her on - (hands phone to:) \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Hi Grandma! I have a new name! (as \"Erin\" frowns...) Yeah! You wanna hear it? \"Erin\" pushes down the lever, ending the call, mutters: \n\"ERIN\" Sorry, your Majesty. Remember: names're secret. \"Queen E.\" nods. Puts on her mournful look... \n\"ERIN\" That is the most pitiful expression I've ever seen. \nCLOSE ON \"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" She listens, cradling the phone. \"Erin\" watches her daughter's face light up: \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Hi Daddy! We're having a great vacation! \nJOE I look forward to that. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK. DAY. \nBaseball diamond. Joe pitching underhand to \"Queen E.\" He's using plastic balls the size of soccer balls, so it's easy for her to hit every one. \"Erin\" is running, retrieving the hits. FREEZE FRAME as she's caught in a photograph. The image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of frozen frames, photographs of her, some wide, some tight. \nREVERSE IMAGE. The park. Mostly empty. No one taking their picture. A stand of green bushes. HOLD on the bushes for a moment - \nEXT. PARK. AN HOUR LATER. \n\"Queen E.\" is curled on a blanket taking a nap as \"Erin\" and Joe finish the picnic. \nJOE You seem like you're doing great. \n\"ERIN\" Yeah. \nJOE How long can you stand it? (off her look) I mean: not to talk to your friends or family or have anything to do with your real life? \n\"ERIN\" (quiet, strong) Gracie is safe. \nJOE Yeah, but what, now Mitch started some kind of custody battle?, what \nDOES - \nROBBIE Are you Denise? SHOCK. There he is, standing right over them, in bad clothes and a baseball cap, dark glasses. Completely unrecognizable. \n\"ERIN\" Pardon me? \nROBBIE You're Denise, right? Used to work at the Pack 'N' Ship? \n\"ERIN\" I'm not Denise. \nROBBIE Oh. Sorry, I... You look-but you're right, your voice... (isn't) You're not from New Zealand, are you? \n\"ERIN\" Never been there. \nROBBIE Boy. Sorry to bother you folks. He backs away, embarrassed. Joe stares after him warily... \nJOE What now? We call Pack 'N' Ship, see if Denise ever - (worked there) \n\"ERIN\" Because of some homeless guy? Joe: it could be the Pack'N'Ship in Trenton, New Jersey. (over his protest) One thing I learned: I can't jump every time someone says boo. I can't do that to her. \nJoe looks at \"Queen E.\" and nods. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \nLooks peaceful. But why do we need this establishing shot? Its very existence in the narrative is menacing. \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \nJoe gets up from \"Queen E. 's\" bed and goes into the kitchen. Gets some juice from the fridge, drinks it. Looks into \"Erin's\" bedroom. \"Erin\" is awake, \"Queen E.\" asleep at her side. Half -whisper: \nJOE Gracie was right. (off her look) 'Bout the dreams in there. \n\"ERIN\" Yeah, mine too. \n(BEAT) Cuddle? \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nEXT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \nWe watch from across the street as \"Erin\" hurries to her Taurus, gets in and drives away. \nEXT. PRE-SCHOOL. DAY. \n\"Erin\" in line for Pick-up. Betty the Pre-school Director comes up to \"Erin\" and says casually: \nBETTY Erin. I'm glad you're here. We can't find Queen Elizabeth - \n\"ERIN\" You can't find her??! \nBETTY So many kids're staying for these after-school things - She turns, distracted, as ANOTHER TEACHER calls - \nn \"Erin\" blinks... looks around frantically... OTHER KIDS in gym or dance gear, but no \"Queen E.\"...and the knowledge of what's happened is hitting her...her eyes're dilating, breathing becoming frantic. Betty turns back as \"Erin\" mutters: \n\"ERIN\" I should've! ... I should've known!, he did it before! She rams the car in gear, rockets out of the pick-up line - Almost hits a TEACHER and 4 YEAR OLD KID - Slams the breaks, calls: \n\"ERIN\" I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... I... Freaked out, frantic, she pulls to the side of the road, yanks up her brake, grabs her cell phone. Auto-dial #2. \nT.T.'S VOICE Double \"A\" Rent \n\"ERIN\" Did Queen Elizabeth call?! \nT.T.'S VOICE No, of course - (not) \n\"ERIN\" Anyone else?! \nT.T.'S VOICE Nobody called, Erin; are you - (okay?) \"Erin\" presses STOP, then Auto-dial #1, waits, looks around. Betty staring at her like she's crazy, walking toward her car - \n\"ERIN'S\" VOICE Hi. Leave a message. \n\"ERIN\" Gracie, are you there?! Is anyone there?! Please? Pick up! No one picks up. Silence. She beats the wheel in frustration... lowers her head. For one long second, she seems completely beaten... \nA KNOCK on her window - She looks up, sees Betty. Betty's talking, but it's as if \"Erin\" has gone crazy. For a moment there's no sound, and then the sound is there but unintelligible, and finally the words and sounds come together: \nBETTY .what I've been trying to tell you... \"Erin\" nodding now, beginning to grasp the words... \nBETTY (CONT.) At the end of dance class, the teacher lets them go hide, and for a minute no one could find her - \"Erin\" looks past Betty, sees \"Queen E.\" in her tutu and leaps out of her car - \n\"ERIN\" Thank you, thank you, I... I'm sorry. I'll explain later, I... She rushes forward, wraps \"Queen E.\" in a big, not quite appropriate hug. \"Queen E.\" looks at her as if to say, \"This is nice, Mom, but will you please tell me what gives?\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RENT-A-CAR. NIGHT. \nFrom a distance, we watch \"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\" trudge toward their Taurus. The end of the day; they're tired. \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. KITCHEN. MIGHT. \nMaking meat loaf. \"Erin\" consults the cookbook, seems confused, puts meat, breadcrusts, eggs, sauces, onions, etc. in a bowl. \"Queen E.\" mooshes them with her fingers - a disgusting tactile job which she adores. IMPROVISE DIALOG to make the scene utterly mundane, two \"girls\" having fun... The normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous. \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \n\"Queen E.\" sleeping peacefully in her bed. \n\"Erin\" also sleeping peacefully. We OBSERVE her from a slight distance, to the left of the bed as we face it. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE. . .down the bed...to the foot ...to the other side.. .back again on \"Erin\" sleeping peacefully... and the CAMERA RISES to show Mitch seated at her side. He seems calm and utterly content. It would be, hard to imagine a more terrifying attitude. \nINT. HER BEDROOM. DAWN. \n\"Erin\" wakes with a start, sits up, looks around - Everything's normal. Peaceful. No Mitch. \"Erin\" shakes her head, as if clearing away a dream. As she looks again around the room, her nostrils flare slightly. . .as if she smells him. She rubs her nose. Touches her wrist, and we notice something she's worn the whole time she's been Erin: a colorful elastic bracelet, probably a Swatch. She gets out of bed and looks out the window - Cold morning - She goes toward the hall... \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Mom, are you sure...?! Quite sure, thank you. \"Erin\" guns the accelerator. Robbie's FACE... driving, confident, full of blood lust, and then his expression changes. Eyes widen. He realizes - shit! too late!! - that the bridge is way too narrow for - \"Erin\" Is car slides through, scraping one side The Suburban crashes into the bridge, careens into the water - \n\"Queen E.\" looks back through the rear view mirror... looks at her mother ...back and forth... \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" That was dangerous. \nINT. CAR. MORNING \nDifferent country road. Parked ahead is a `78 Oldsmobile. \"Erin\" pulls in behind it. They get out of the Taurus. Using her keys, \"Erin\" unlocks the trunk of the Olds. Two large suitcases inside. \"Erin\" throws their small suitcase in on top. \"Erin\" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a wallet. Checks the contents: cash, credit cards. \"Queen E.\" pulls a red wig out of the glove compartment. \nINT. OLDSMOBILE. MORNING. \nThey're on a lightly travelled two-lane highway. \"Erin\" (now a redhead) looks in her rear-view mirror: no cars. \n\"ERIN\" Okay, Toots. We can talk. \"Queen E.\" stares at her mutely. \n\"ERIN\" {CONT.} Want me to tell you what happened? \"Queen E.\" blinks twice, shakes her head. \n\"ERIN\" {CONT.} Fair enough. One thing, though: Erin's over. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" (Too bad.} I liked Erin. Slim nods sadly: she liked Erin too. \nSLIM You're not the Queen of England anymore either. Gracie nods fatalistically, stares out the window. Flat voice: \nGRACIE I'm hungry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINER. DAY. \nGracie eating voraciously. Slim has no appetite. Their WAITRESS comes over, notices Slim's not eating - \nWAITRESS Everything okay here? \nSLIM \n(NODS) Thanks. \nWAITRESS \n(TO GRACIE) Hey there, cutie, what's your name? Gracie looks up at her for a while. \nGRACIE I'm working on that one. The waitress does a double-take and leaves. To Slim: \nGRACIE {CONT.) Maybe something normal this time. Ann or Mary or... (sees Slim is distracted) Mom? \nSLIM I'm thinking. Beat. \nGRACIE (Yeah,) I can hear it. \nCUT. TO: \nEXT. COURTHOUSE. DAY. \nSlim parks. As she starts to get out, she says to Gracie: \nSLIM Anybody talks to you, hit the horn. \nINT. COURTHOUSE. DAY. \nSlim in line at a COUNTY RECORDER'S desk. The person in front of her leaves, she steps up: \nSLIM I need the best lawyer in town. \nSLIM'S VOICE Oh yeah? How 'bout Horace? Ginny glances at one of her kids, evidently Horace's child. \nGINNY Okay, this is the second most - \nSLIM'S VOICE Rent a car, drive to Denver, then fly to Reno. \nGINNY You're out of your mind. \nI \nSLIM'S VOICE (as though flattered) You noticed. Dialtone. We watch from a distance as Ginny shakes her head in disbelief, mutters to her kids. As they trudge off, the CAMERA FOLLOWS. \nINT. AIRPORT. RENTAL CAR COUNTER. DAY. \nFrom the same distance: Ginny and kids approach the counter. \nINT. AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE. RENT-A-CAR AREA. DAY. \nGinny loading luggage into the back as her kids climb in. As Ginny slams the trunk, SOMEONE'S RIGHT THERE - Slim. Ginny blinks, recognizes her, hugs her: \nGINNY What're you... (doing here?) I thought we were... (driving to Reno) \nSLIM I had to make sure you weren't followed. \nGINNY (re Slim's hair) I like it. (not so sure) Maybe. \n(SEES GRACIE) Hey, Graceland. Gracie slips out from behind Slim, goes and hugs Ginny as Slim holds up a wallet: \nSLIM There's a credit card and cash. It's on me, but make no calls home, or to Phil. Think of it as a vacation till the Orca reopens. Toots? \nThis to Gracie, who started to climb into the car. Gracie looks at Slim and again tries to climb in - she wants }}g part of saying goodbye - but Slim pulls her back into a hug. Slim holds her for as long as Gracie can possibly tolerate. When Slim is done, Gracie climbs into the car with Ginny's kids. Slim has tears in her eyes. \nSLIM Take care of her, okay? Extra ice- cream and... and if you need to reach me... (hands her a cell phone) Just don't call your friends. \nGINNY Oh great. I'll call strangers. \nSLIM In an emergency, I'm #1 on the auto- dialer. Or I'll call you. Any calls between us must run is seconds or less. Cake? \nGINNY \nPIE - \nSLIM Ass. (re the vacation) Enjoy it, huh? \nGINNY How long? \nSLIM The custody hearing's end of next month. That's my deadline. \nGINNY Deadline for what? Slim looks at her... \nCUT TO: \nWE'RE SO CLOSE WE CAN'T TELL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. CAMERA \nSLOWLY PULLS BACK: EYES ...SLIM'S EYES. Intense, focussed. \nTHE KNOWLEDGE \nMAN'S VOICE You ready? She nods. CAMERA CONTINUES BACK, we see more of her face. \nMAN'S VOICE Sure? Another nod. Perspiration streaming from her pores, running down her face. And a look we haven't seen before. \nMAN'S VOICE Can you lose? She shakes her head. \nJUPITER How's that black guy I .set you up with? \nSLIM Good. \nJUPITER Did he teach you how to think? It's not the question she expected; it's more interesting and complicated. \nSLIM .I hope so. (before he can speak) The English guy is good too. \n(ALL BUSINESS) But that's not why I'm here. I need a woman who looks like me. Someone who can handle herself: an off-duty cop or something. (hands him photo) Five four, one ten. Hair like this but cut higher, over the ear - (hands him key) Miko hotel, room 509, 8 o'clock. \nJUPITER Tonic ? That's awful short notice; I don't know if I can - \nSLIM What? I thought Jupiter was like all-powerful, king of the Gods? Oh yeah. One more thing. At some point.. .not right now 'cause it'd be phony ...I need you to acknowledge that I'm your kid. She walks away. He stares after her. Hint of a smile comes to his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELECTRONICS STORE. DAY. \nSlim is signing the credit card slip as the CLERK puts the merchandise in a distinctive red bag - \nSLIM You sure this'll work? \nCLERK You bet your life. \nSLIM Thanks, I will. She leaves, taking out her cell phone. FOLLOW HER as she goes: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET. DAY. \nShe walks up the street, punches in a number... \nBUTLER'S VOICE Tyler residence. \nSLIM Yes. Tony. Could you please tell Mrs. Tyler that I'll call her around f our this afternoon. \nBUTLER'S VOICE Of course, Miss Slim. My pleasure. Slim hangs up, goes into a. bagel shop. \nINT.. BAGEL PLACE. LATER. \nSlim sits at a table with a cup of coffee. A short guy, 28, built like a fireplug, dressed in sweater and jeans and wool cap, enters, walks to her, and says in an English accent: \nALEX Today, hon, you graduate. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. STREET. DAY. \nAlex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint. \nSLIM It's closed? \nALEX Till six, eh? \nSLIM And I'd guess whoever owns it isn't a very nice person. \nALEX That's a safe one. Slim starts walking toward the shop. As they go: \nSLIM Why here? \nALEX You've got soft hands, you've worked hard. The tricky part now is nerves. They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools. \nSLIM People on the street? \nALEX Yeah. And you have to go in when his alarm's turned off - \nTOVA And tonight? \nSLIM Go around the corner, eat at Guido's. \nTOVA I'll be followed? \nSLIM Green trenchcoat. Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair. \nSLIM (CONT.) Wish me luck, huh? \nTOVA Good luck. \nSLIM Luck has nothing to do with it. Tova smiles. \nINT. HOTEL. HALL. NIGHT. \nSlim waiting as the Service Elevator arrives. Gets in. \nEXT. HOTEL. REAR ENTRANCE. NIGHT. \nSlim going out the door, down the alley... \nINT. AIRPORT. NIGHT. \nSlim getting on the plane to Los Angeles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN PEDRO STREET. NIGHT. \nSlim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts. \nBATTLE OF THE She takes a duffle from the back seat. Steps into the shadows, stares at the warehouse: Brick building, modern door and light fixtures. \nSEXES She looks both ways: The street's dark. Deserted. She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath. And crosses the street. Goes up the stairs to the stoop. Looks at the alarm panel on the door: green. Crouches, starts to work on the lock. \nINT. WAREHOUSE/LOFT. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT. \nMitch in bed, sleeping. Peaceful. A SOUND, Off. He stirs slightly. \nANOTHER SOUND. He sits up. Frowning... dazed. Cocks his head. Listens... The SILENCE seems to have texture. He gets up. \nWe glimpse: a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into an open, loft-like space filled with bird'seye maple, metal beams, etc. Modern, glistening, expensive. He walks around the place in the dark. In his boxer shorts and t-shirt. He looks vulnerable... SLIM'S POV... From one corner. Observing him. She has become the stalker. HER EYES, watching... He decides everything's okay and goes back to the semi partitioned sleeping area... He gets back into bed - next to a YOUNG BLOND WOMAN, 22. She turns over, mutters something, goes back to sleep. He lies there, eyes open. Stays very still. Listening. \nJARRING CUT TO: \nINT. SAME WAREHOUSE. MORNING. \nBright light. Mitch in his bathrobe making coffee. The Young Blond Woman comes out, fully dressed... \nMITCH Coffee? \nYOUNG BLOND I gotta get home, change for work. He nods, gives her a perfunctory kiss: \nMITCH I'll call you. She stares at him a second. \nYOUNG BLOND You want my number? \nMITCH Sure. She sees how \"eager\" he is to talk to her again. Irritated, she scribbles the number quickly, hands.it to him - \nMITCH Thanks for everything. \nFor the sex, in other words. She gives it right back to him: \nSLIM \nYEAH - \nGINNY'S VOICE It worked?! \nSLIM Listen to me! I did it, but I can't do it! I can't kill him! Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur... \nGINNY'S VOICE (CONT.) \n(URGENTLY) Slim. He'll come after you - \nSLIM I know - \nGINNY'S VOICE (CONT.) He'll come after Gracie - \nAn indistinct shape, something rising over her head... \nSLIM I know all that! I have to, but I can't! I'm not a killer! I'm not him! Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp. She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side - - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull. Still sends her crashing to the floor. Now she does not move. He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but triumphant. \nGINNY'S VOICE Hello? Slim? You there? The lamp moving in his hand. He's rotating it. A simple menacing image... . and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again. \nGINNY'S VOICE {CONT.} Should I call the cops?! Answer me?! He's distracted by Ginny's voice. Picks up the phone. \nMITCH Listen to me, bitch. Ginny's silent. \nMITCH (CONT.) if you value your children, don' t call anybody. It's over, okay? It's all over. He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim, lamp clenched tight in his fist. \nSMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE. CLOSER STILL. We're almost inside her head as we hear: \nINSTRUCTOR'S VOICE Hold onto my voice... \nIs that the hint of a smile on her face? \nINSTRUCTOR'S VOICE (CONT.) You're ready... Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it - Rage. He pulls his foot back to kick her - Her eyes are open, just a slit - His foot swinging forward... As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it - He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her - But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up - Coming to her feet - He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug... SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls: Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly executed, is the most difficult, powerful, and beautiful of punches. Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of- gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin - as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely. Mitch flies backward... There's a table behind him. His head cracks on the table. His neck snaps. He lands on the floor: twisted, broken. Slim stares at him. There's no way a living man could assume the position now occupied by her former husband. \nShe stares in disbelief. Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery. Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief. She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up. Listens: no one there. She presses redial, waits... \nGINNY'S VOICE (in a panic) H o?d \nSLIM Hi. \nGINNY'S VOICE Oh thank God you're alive. \nSLIM Gin, he's ...he hit his...he's not breathing. \nGINNY'S VOICE oh. \nSLIM Yeah. \nGINNY'S VOICE Well: I called the cops, they're on their way. Slim nods. \nGINNY'S VOICE Slim... can you hear me?, this is important. Beat. \nSLIM Okay. As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building. \nGINNY'S VOICE You're not him, okay? You're not him, and you never will be. \nSLIM See you soon. She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water. Then the duffle. They both sink. \nEXT. BROWNSTONE. \nShe comes out, sits on the steps. A siren is audible. Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop. TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR, run toward her. \n", "test1_input": "IS Keeps laughing, which really gets Gracie going. Mitch looks on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that: they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter; it's all between the mother and child. So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes, they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction, and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face, Slim looks up at him - For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf between them... Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the \"girls\" are laughing again...and Mitch is not. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM/BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nSHOWER STALL. Glass, opaque, streaked with water and soap so as to give a slightly freaky aspect. Someone inside. Slim watching. Smiles. Starts to take off her clothes. \nSLIM Hey. \nMITCH Hey. \nSLIM \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Should I join you? \nMITCH I'm about to get out. \nSLIM (down to her panties) Oh. \nMITCH I have to go to back to work, I'm just doing this to wake myself up. \nSLIM \n(DISAPPOINTED) Okay. (starts to go) \nMITCH \n(CALLS) Sorry. \nSLIM \n(TO HERSELF) Yeah. (Me too.) She's in the bedroom now. It's underlit, full of shadows. In scary-movie nomenclature, she's exposed, vulnerable; it feels like someone's going to leap out and attack her at any - Not this time. She throws on shorts and a t-shirt - \nINT. HALL. NIGHT. \nShe looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully. Consoling image. \nINT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. \nShe's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself. The counter's covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook. A noise. Pager. Not beeping, just humming slightly: she wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter. Sounds vaguely like a vibrator. Lying there, just a few feet from her. With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone. She looks at it. .knows she shouldn't... decides not to... Can't resist. Dries her.hands methodically on a dishtowel. Picks up the pager. Reads: 33. She stares, realizing: it's code. She looks at the cell phone. Wonders whether... Looks toward the hall. We HEAR the shower still running... She picks up his cell phone. Tentatively - she's not sure this will work - she presses: RECALL 33. The phone flashes NAME, but instead of a name there's: . She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep breath.. .and presses SEND. Waits... listens nervously... \nWOMAN'S VOICE \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Hello there. \nSLIM You just paged my husband, right? \n(HALF BEAT) Mitch. \n(HALF BEAT) Who are you, what's your name? \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'm sorry, I - \nSLIM It's too late to deny it. Tell me your - (name) A rustle on the other end - \nSLIM (CONT.) Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl Silence. \nSLIM (CONT.) Just your name. That's the least you could do, don't you think? A simple plea, one woman to another... \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'm...Darcelle. Not only the name. Now we hear it in the accent: she's French. Dialtone. Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward. She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF. Scans the room as if she's never seen it before. One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it. Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up, her body moves down. She slumps to the floor. Sits. Stares. \nWIDER ANGLE. MINUTES LATER. Slim sitting on the floor. Frozen. Head bowed. \n", "test1_true": "MITCH Hey. She doesn' t say anything. He approaches her. Some instinct keeps him from speaking. He sees she's holding his phone, the silly toy... \nSLIM How can you do this to Gracie? He doesn't say anything. \nSLIM (CONT.) Darcelle paged you. That' s where you're going, right? (off his silence) Yeah. Wow. Mitch? Can you please? Can you sit here with me? He does. She doesn't know where to start, how to talk about it... \nSLIM She's French? \nMITCH She isn't important. \nSLIM No. \nMITCH You're important. \nSLIM Yes. \nMITCH And Gracie. She nods. \nSLIM Mitch?, I can't... I couldn't stand for this to... (destroy our lives) I'm happy, I've really been happy, and I don't want to - (give that up) \nMITCH You won't have to. Believe me. She's nothing, she's no-one - \nSLIM You... Damn it! You said I was safe with you! \nMITCH You are, Slim. You are. I promise. They fall into an embrace. We feel how keenly they need each other. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT. \nThey're hugging. Begin TIGHT on them. At first it seems like this is the same embrace shot from a different angle. Then we see we're in the kitchen, his briefcase is at his side; their clothes are different. \nSING A SAD SONG We watch Slim's expression slowly change. From pleasure. To confusion. Pain. Outrage. She whispers: \nSLIM I smell her. \nMITCH What? \nSLIM Her perfume. Darcelle or whoever. \nMITCH \nSLIM - \nSLIM (intense, sad) How many, Mitch? How many are there? How many have there been? \nMITCH What does it matter? A stunning statement. Even more stunning because of the casual way he says it. \nMITCH (CONT.) ID I mean what're you saying here, that I don't deserve to get laid? Please. I'm a man, Slim. With the pregnancies, Gracie, you don't have time and energy like you used to, and I understand that, I really do. Men and women have different needs, and that's okay. Darcelle is willing to take care of it, and maybe that's better for everybody. \nSLIM Including you? He contemplates his answer...and shrugs. \nSLIM No! No! No! \nMITCH Calm down, Slim - Wild, violently invading his space and assaulting his authority, screaming at him, her face just inches from his: \nI \nSLIM I can't do this anymore! I can't! Just take it, and take it, and take it!? I'm not strong enough! I don't know who would be. I love you, okay? I love you and I'm your wife and you can't do this! You understand me?!!! No more! No more! With the same speed he attacked \"Our Hero\" at the diner, Mitch's hand shoots out like a snake striking. Slaps her. A warning: stop it and stop it now. Her face: shock. Confusion. Outrage. She raises her hand to her cheek. Touches her skin where his fist landed... He reads her expression and is almost amused: \nMITCH What, I can't hit you? \nSLIM (low, strong) No. You can't. He hits her again, this time with a closed fist. \n", "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT. \n\"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\" eating pasta.

And he turns the little dogleg and looks at them - Except they're no longer there. They've moved toward the unloading area for Joe's gate... And Robbie goes safely past as Joe enters the terminal, sees them, shakes his head: \nJOE I can guarantee one thing in my lifetime: I was not followed. He embraces \"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\"\" The CAMERA looks past them to where Robbie might be watching. He's not. \nCUT TO: \nINT/EXT. THEIR TAURUS/MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN. DAY. \n\"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\" are pointing out sights, passing an OLD \nFASHIONED DINER: \n\"ERIN\" And there's the diner where I do not work. \nJOE Where do you work? \"Erin\" gives him a look: she's not telling. She resumes the tour, points to an old crumbling \"movie palace:\"' \n\"ERIN\" There's the one-plex. (pointing again at a \nNOT-TOO-FANCY PLACE) The \u00e2\u0082\u00acan restaurant where you'd take me if we were dating... (for \"Queen E.19 which we are not. \nVery fast, like an old routine; we see how they play together: \nJOE No way. \n\"ERIN\" Not at all. \nJOE Just friends, right Gracie? \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Queen Elizabeth. \nJOE Right. Sorry, your highness. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" No problem. \"Erin\" pulls up in front of their house, gestures: here it is. \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. HALL. DAY. \nContinuing the tour, they're showing him: \n\"ERIN\" And this is the guest bedroom... \n(CONT . ) \nINT. \"QUEEN ELIZABETH'S\" ROOM. EVENING. \nHe comes in, looks around. Clearly \"Queen E.\" has painted the walls herself : it's a \"modern-art\" mesa. \n\"ERIN\" (CONT.) .normally known as Buckingham palace. \nJOE (nods, checks it out) Very... colorful. \n\"ERIN\" You better warn him, huh? \"Queen E.\" looks confused. \"Erin\" whispers in her daughter's ear, and she confides in Joe: \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Oh yeah. The dreams in here get really noisy. Joe sets his suitcase down. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. STREET. NIGHT. \nMitch walks down the street. Up the steps, punches in his alarm code. \nINT. MITCH'S PLACE. NIGHT. \nMitch enters, closes and locks the door. Turns on the light. He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat. Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket. The lights go out. Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness. He looks out the window, sees: The neighboring buildings still have light and power. He cocks his head, listening. Silence. Walks to the door of the bedroom area. Waits. Take two more steps - \nSLIM'S VOICE It's me. He nods slowly. \nMITCH Yeah. (I thought so.) \nHe moves quietly to the bed... to the night table where Slim found the pistol. Covers this by talking: \nMITCH {CONT.} This morning too? \nSLIM'S VOICE You always did forget to turn off the coffee. He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor - \nSLIM'S VOICE {CONT.} I found it, Mitch. His hand leaves the drawer. He thinks. Picks up the phone, listens. Dead. Looks around... can't see her... Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial. He punches 911 and pressed SEND. The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on. He stares at it. Tries again. 911, SEND. Again it goes dead. \nSLIM'S VOICE It's a machine. Knocks out cell phones. He throws the cell phone onto the bed. Walks out of the bedroom area. Looks around the vast space. Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow. He doesn't see her. \nWalks toward his desk. \nSLIM'S VOICE I found that gun too. He stops. Doesn't know where to go. or what to do. \nSLIM'S VOICE Scared? \nMITCH \n(FUCK YOU) Of what? \nSLIM'S VOICE Now is when you decide, Mitch. (off his silence) Whether you're a coward. If you are, you can run. I won't stop you. \nMITCH (meaning the match is unfair:) You have my guns. \nSLIM'S VOICE Threw 'em away. \nMITCH Then someone's here with you. \nSLIM'S VOICE No. \nMITCH \n(INCREDULOUS) You're alone? \nSLIM'S VOICE Why not? \nMITCH 'Cause it'd be stupid. Silence is her answer. \nMITCH (CONT.) You're sayin' this is man to man? \nSLIM'S VOICE Woman, Mitch. \nMITCH That's what I meant: man against woman - you sure that's fair? The lights go back on. Slowly Slim comes out from hiding... \nSLIM Fair to whom? As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area between two couches. She has no weapon. She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny. He moves toward her. \nSLIM This is what you wanted, right? What you were going to San Francisco for: the chance to get me alone? He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses. He begins to stalk her. And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in the way she was practicing. \nMITCH I don't understand, Slim. How does this work for you? She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants to know where he's going to attack. \nMITCH (CONT.) I mean: this is carefully thought out, right? She does not respond. He throws three punches. None of them hits her. He's unfazed, keeps stalking... \n", "test3_true": "MITCH (CONT.) So all you've done is further piss me off. \nSLIM Self defense is not ,murder. This stops him cold.. He lowers his hands a moment. Stares at her, trying to assimilate this new information... \nMITCH You don't have the guts. She just looks at him. He blinks, worried for an instant. Covers it with a smile: \nMITCH It's not self-defense when you break in here and attack me. \nSLIM So far you're attacking me. He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in - She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps over the couch to avoid being hit. He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good, and she's waiting for him as he stumbles - With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose. He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to him: this might not be easy. He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood. \nSLIM You see? I'm just defending myself. He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary. \nMITCH If you fail, you can count on this: you'll never see Gracie again. She reacts - He sees it, rushes her - Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he makes a terrifying force. Until: She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall - He hits it, bounces off. Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face. He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together: \nMITCH You really (think) ...you think you'll kill me and get away with it?l \nSLIM I told you. Self-defense. I came here, as arranged in our letters, to talk about Gracie - \nMITCH Letters? There are no - \nSLIM In the drawer where your pistol was. You just left prints all over them. He stares at her, stunned in every way. Touches his forehead, feels the blood... \nSLIM You attacked me, I fought back. And of course if you never touch me... \n(SWEET SMILE) I'll have to give myself bruises... He goes berserk. Leaps at her, covering ground quickly with his long stride, swinging his massive arms. This is the most terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one. If he should hit her even once, a glancing blow, she will go down, she will break, it will be over. \nIII But he misses, and misses again. Sometimes his punches are wild, almost comical. Others come so close we hear-the wind, feel their power, feel his sweat on her... CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction for as long as it will hold. At every instant, we fear for her bones and her life. Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad Ali to barely slip a punch, and we see terror on her face, married to determination. She knows the score. and the odds. Finally, in frustration at so many misses, he grabs an ashtray, hurls.it at her - it flies over her head - He punches again and again, wildly. She remains untouched. He stops. With all the blood, he looks like a wild animal. He makes a great effort to pull himself together... \nMITCH This doesn't bother me, Slim. I don't care how long it takes. We both know: Ionly have to hit you once. Once, and it's over. She laughs at him. This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can stand. He rushes at her again, fast - She starts left - He blocks her way - She starts right - Again he's blocking her - She lunges to the left, through a narrow space - He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows. She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of her strategy is to keep him angry: \nSLIM I'm confused, Mitchy. Aren't you a man? \n(QUOTING HIM) I thought it was \"no contest?\" I mean, can't you hit me even once? He grabs a lamp, yanks out the cord, wields it like a club. \nSLIM (CONT.) \n(AMUSED) A weapon? He smashes the lamp down, just missing her head - \nSLIM (CONT.) It's a martial-arts cliche, honey. A weapon throws you off balance - \nSWISH - \nSWIPE - \nSLAM - He misses her three times, the last time smashing the lamp into the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand. He yelps - \nSLIM (CONT.) You see? He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand - And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist against his head - He flies back, bounces vs. the wall. As he comes off it, she punches him again - He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed - She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed - Right into the opposite wall. The top of his head hits the wall. He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head to \nTOE - He drops. \nFace down. Does not move. At all. She stares at him. Goes to him. Wary. Gives him a reflex test - No reaction. He's unconscious. She tests his neck for a pulse. Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand over her head. Her palm vertical, like a knife. She's about to deliver a karate chop. To his neck. it will break his neck. It will kill him. Her hand stays there, poised. CAMERA PLUNGES IN ON HER FACE. \nFLASHES: - Mitch hitting her the first time - - Midwest house, Mitch leaping out from Gracie's doorway - - Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of their house. (Something we didn't see before.) She reaches up, flicks the light switch; Mitch jumps on her back - - Mitch: \"You'll never see Gracie again.\" - Earlier: \"She's My daughter. Don't even think about taking her.\" - Strangling Slim, whispering: \"...where you're going, they will never... ever... find you.\" \nBACK TO SLIM Face contorted in rage, confusion - She brings her hand down - Misses. him. Intentionally. Turns away, tears in her eyes. She retrieves her cell phone, turns off the cell-phone blocker, presses redial. Stares out the window. We see the turmoil on her face, hear it in her voice: \nSLIM I can't, Gin. \nGINNY'S VOICE 'Re you okay? \nSLIM Yeah. \nGINNY'S VOICE You're okay?!, you beat him?! \n"}

{"train": "ENOUGH \nWritten by \nNicholas Kazan \nREVISED - 3B \nDialog in parenthesis is (not spoken aloud). \nNOTE ON TITLES: GRAPHIC TITLES pop up throughout. Some are chapter titles, others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons. Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion. At other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles ought to be wilder and less uniform than I suggest on the page. \nHEY HER FACE. FLASHES . She looks gorgeous, then ordinary, sloppy, white waitress uniform, gorgeous again, dishes stacked in her arms, turning, looking, happy, tired. INTERCUT TITLES. \nSLIM Hi, can I help you? What would you like? Want a menu? Hey Billy. Hey Tom. You take care, Rosie. \nWe get a sense of her: 23, smart, good attitude, proud to be on her own and supporting herself even if the job is menial. She moves quickly, physically, with an almost athletic grace - \nSLIM Sure thing, Annie. Have a good one. That's two straight up. You're good to go. Morning. Hey there. Morning to you. (beat, embarrassed) What? (looks down, sees she's carrying lunch food) Right. Afternoon. \nA sense of the diner too. 50's-style joint: hip, lively; a fun pl ace full of wacko signs that tell us we're in some modestly sized So. Cal. beach community. \nSLIM What can I get you? Whattaya like? Whattaya want? (rolls eyes; good-humored rejection of a.come-on:) Nice try, bud - \n(INCREDULOUS) Does that ever work? Hey, lemme get that for you. Hey. Common' right up. \nEND TITLES as we FLASH FOOD IMAGES: beans/eggs/pie/burger/shake /waffle/grilled cheese, fast flow of too much grub as words fly \nUP : \nHOW THEY MET \nINT. \"THE ORCA\" RESTAURANT. DAY. \nFLURRY OF MOVEMENT, WAITRESSES setting up for lunch, Slim joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly offended, working-class accent: \nGINNY Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer... Plus: I have a logical mind... \nSLIM And you're only like 299 thousand short of what you'd need for law school. \nFAST RIFF: \nGINNY I Piece of cake - \nSLIM Piece of pie - \nGINNY Piece of ass. So what would you do? \nSLIM I don't know... \nGINNY \nLIAR - \nSLIM \n(EMBARRASSED) I'm also thinking... well ...I could go back to school. \nGINNY In what? I thought you hated - \nSLIM Psychology maybe, I don't know. I know it's not cool to say so, but I'd like to contribute something to society, even if - (it's just) \nGINNY We contribute. We give 'em food, energy, so they can go out and save Western Civilization - A bell rings, a CUSTOMER comes in, and the owner of the place, PHIL (45, Syrian, also the cook) sticks his head between them: \nGINNY He likes you. \nSLIM I think he's just a dick. \nGINNY Slim...he was in yesterday - \nSLIM I know - \nGINNY And he's back today with a rose, he pulls you into conversation. Honey, if you can't tell he likes you, you need to study psychology. \nSLIM Okay, so he likes me. \nGINNY Do you like him? \nSLIM I don't know him. \nGINNY What's that got to do with it? Slim: he is a major piece of cake/piece of pie. \nSLIM I didn't notice. \nGINNY Trust me. Carrot cake. And when a guy like that - cuter than you? - he actually likes you - \nSLIM He's cuter than me?? tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favorite \nROUTINE: \nGINNY Hey. Wise up, huh? No-one is ever gonna go for you 'cause of your looks. \nSLIM \n(NODS SOBERLY) That is bad news, 'cause my personality bites. Ginny grins. Slim writes up a check for a CUSTOMER at the counter. When she finishes, the turkey burger is up. She carries it to the table: \nSLIM TB, coleslaw, and so forth. You don't really write books, do you? \nOUR HERO Nope. \nSLIM I don't read Finnecan's Wake either. \nOUR HERO I'm goin' into law. Enforcement. She nods. This is more like what she expected. \nSLIM Who's the rose for? He shrugs. She's busy, so she starts to go: \nSLIM Enjoy your grub, huh? She's seven feet away when she hears: \nOUR HERO \nHEY - Sheturns back toward him - He smiles, offers the rose: \nOUR HERO You. She smiles back-their eyes meet... a sudden utterly magical moment. This is also the moment to.note OUR HERO should be played by a famous actor doing a cameo. Because at this instant the scene changes. The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns and looks at Slim. Stands. Looks down at Our Hero... \nMITCH How much did you settle on? \nOUR HERO Excuse. me? Slim frowns, steps closer so she can overhear: \nMITCH The bet. How much is it? Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face - \nMITCH (CONT.) You and your friend. Yesterday. Was it 200 or 500 or - ? \nSLIM \n(TO MITCH) What're you - \nMITCH He bet his friend he could get in your pants in less than twelve hours, starting noon today. Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger - \nGINNY Why am I not believing this? \n(INTRIGUED) Can I take you home right now? \nJOE If you've got a sense of humor. \nGINNY My kids are out for the night, and... \nJOE Another thing: I live in Chicago; women always want the possibility of \nLONG-TERM - \nGINNY I didn't propose, huh? I just want to have... (looks at him...) a brief and completely unsatisfying sexual encounter. \nJOE Hey. I'm your guy. She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser... We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly: tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him... \nSLIM You sure,you love me? \nMITCH Uh-huh... \nSLIM For ever and ever? He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions: \nMITCH You're safe with me, Slim. You're safe, and it's okay to be happy. We deserve it. They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over, waits. When they break: \nPHIL I'm sorry, I gotta get up five o'clock to buy green beans. He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand: \nPHIL In my country, it's tradition to give money to groom. You don't need it, but... Slim shakes her head, touched, as: \nMITCH That's very sweet - \nSLIM \n(HUGGING PHIL) Thanks for giving me away, okay? You're the best substitute Dad a girl could possibly have. \nPHIL No substitute. I am real thing. She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him. \nMITCH He really loves you. She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away. Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers: \nMITCH You gonna give me babies? \nSLIM Oh yeah. \nMITCH How soon? \nSLIM How soon can we get out of here? He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor. Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true... \nCUT TO: \nCONQUERING HERO \nEXT. SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE WITH GROUNDS. DAY. \nSlim (4 months pregnant) stands'on the walkway leading up to a large, simple,' beautiful house. Mitch is knocking at the door. The man who answers the door is 62, white-haired, vigorous. Looks like he walked out of a Viagra ad. \nHOME OWNER Hello? \nMITCH Hi. We've been driving around, and my wife has completely fallen in love with your house. \nHOME OWNER It's great, isn't it? \nMITCH We want to buy it. The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulging \nWIFE: \nIS Keeps laughing, which really gets Gracie going. Mitch looks on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that: they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter; it's all between the mother and child. So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes, they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction, and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face, Slim looks up at him - For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf between them... Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the \"girls\" are laughing again...and Mitch is not. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM/BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nSHOWER STALL. Glass, opaque, streaked with water and soap so as to give a slightly freaky aspect. Someone inside. Slim watching. Smiles. Starts to take off her clothes. \nSLIM Hey. \nMITCH Hey. \nSLIM \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Should I join you? \nMITCH I'm about to get out. \nSLIM (down to her panties) Oh. \nMITCH I have to go to back to work, I'm just doing this to wake myself up. \nSLIM \n(DISAPPOINTED) Okay. (starts to go) \nMITCH \n(CALLS) Sorry. \nSLIM \n(TO HERSELF) Yeah. (Me too.) She's in the bedroom now. It's underlit, full of shadows. In scary-movie nomenclature, she's exposed, vulnerable; it feels like someone's going to leap out and attack her at any - Not this time. She throws on shorts and a t-shirt - \nINT. HALL. NIGHT. \nShe looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully. Consoling image. \nINT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. \nShe's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself. The counter's covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook. A noise. Pager. Not beeping, just humming slightly: she wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter. Sounds vaguely like a vibrator. Lying there, just a few feet from her. With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone. She looks at it. .knows she shouldn't... decides not to... Can't resist. Dries her.hands methodically on a dishtowel. Picks up the pager. Reads: 33. She stares, realizing: it's code. She looks at the cell phone. Wonders whether... Looks toward the hall. We HEAR the shower still running... She picks up his cell phone. Tentatively - she's not sure this will work - she presses: RECALL 33. The phone flashes NAME, but instead of a name there's: . She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep breath.. .and presses SEND. Waits... listens nervously... \nWOMAN'S VOICE \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Hello there. \nSLIM You just paged my husband, right? \n(HALF BEAT) Mitch. \n(HALF BEAT) Who are you, what's your name? \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'm sorry, I - \nSLIM It's too late to deny it. Tell me your - (name) A rustle on the other end - \nSLIM (CONT.) Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl Silence. \nSLIM (CONT.) Just your name. That's the least you could do, don't you think? A simple plea, one woman to another... \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'm...Darcelle. Not only the name. Now we hear it in the accent: she's French. Dialtone. Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward. She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF. Scans the room as if she's never seen it before. One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it. Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up, her body moves down. She slumps to the floor. Sits. Stares. \nWIDER ANGLE. MINUTES LATER. Slim sitting on the floor. Frozen. Head bowed. \nMITCH'S VOICE \n(FOR DARCELLE) How is my little croissant? \nSLIM It's your loaf of bread. \nMITCH'S VOICE (cheerful, no guilt) Oh. Hi. How's it going? \nSLIM Where are you? \nMITCH'S VOICE Zoo. \nSLIM Why didn't you tell me you were going to - (pick up Gracie) \nMITCH'S VOICE I called you at home, left messages - He's interrupted by a LOUD SQUEAL from Gracie, followed by a question, which he answers: \nMITCH'S VOICE (CONT.) Your Mom. \nGRACIE'S VOICE Hey Moml The elephants are peeing! \nMITCH'S VOICE (pleased with himself for being a good Dad) She's a little excited. \nSLIM When are you coming home? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT. \nDinner. It's scary that Mitch will have this conversation in front of Gracie, who's playing at their feet: \nMITCH It made me nervous when I couldn't reach you. Slim shrugs. He stares at her. Smiles. His voice so soft and calm: \nMITCH {CONT.} Do you have any idea how bad things can get? \nSLIM Educate me. \nMITCH (embarrassed to say it) Slim. I'm a determined person. I was determined to have you, and I did. This house...the company...I am, and always will be, a person who gets what he wants. You can either share in my success or leave us (meaning him and Gracie) right now. Which way you wanna go? Beat. \nSLIM I want to be happy. He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt : \nMITCH Good. With a sudden shock, Slim sees Gracie staring at Mitch: the girl has picked up on his tone. Slim glances at Mitch to see if he notices Gracie's expression. He doesn't. \nSlim looks back at Gracie: still staring at Mitch. If she already senses what's happening, how long before she's affected by it? How long before she sees Mitch become violent? Slim's jaw tightens slightly; her resolve grows stronger. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nMitch asleep, Slim awake, listening. His breathing deep, rhythmic, slight hint of a snore. In the distance, a DOVE coos. She looks at her clock: 2:15. She eases out of bed. Goes into the bathroom. We hear the sound of her peeing. \nINT. BATHROOM. \nShe's no peeing. A BOTTLE is propped up, running water into the toilet as Slim gets dressed. Quickly, silently. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nShe leans out the bathroom doorway, sees: he's still asleep. She moves quickly, bathroom to hall. \nINT. GRACIE'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nGracie's fast asleep. Slim lifts her up, piles her prized teddy bear on top. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT. \nMITCH That's right. \nPHIL Then we die young. The others are uncertain, but Phil helps Slim up; Teddy joins him. Ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up Gracie.. \nSLIM \n(VERY SOFT) (This is no good.) You're humiliating him. \nGINNY What? \nSLIM (a little louder) He'll come after me and kill me. Mitch overhears this, smiles. \nMITCH You hear that? That's why she loves me. (off their horrified looks) Nobody cares like I do. The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward the door. Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers: \nMITCH See you soon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. VAN. NIGHT. \nGracie awake now in Slim's arms: staring, confused. Gentle rocking of the van. The others barely visible, like shadows. \nCHECK, PLEASE \nINT. AIRPLANE. DAY. \nGracie asleep, Slim holding her. Blinds down, movie playing. Despite Gracie's age, the angle and soft lighting make this resemble a Madonna and child... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NAVY PIER (CHICAGO). EVENING. \nOpen air market: shops, stalls; yuppie heaven. Slim carries Gracie on her shoulders. They're with Jog (her old boyfriend, from the wedding). Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie eating a pastry. They stop and look out at Lake Michigan. \nSLIM Wow ... whattaya think, Toots? \nGRACIE It's a big ocean! \nJOE Well. It's only a lake, but we like it. \nGRACIE (nods, stares out... Can we stay here a while? \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOE'S CAR. NIGHT. \nThey're driving along, suddenly Joe says - \nJOE Coming up, whattaya say?! \nGRACIE & SLIM \n(A GAME) Bobbing for apples! Slim (front seat) and Gracie (back) both drop their heads so they can't be seen from outside the car - Joe turns the corner, presses a garage door opener, and drives into the basement garage of a nice-looking 4-plex. \nINT. JOE'S 4-PLEX. NIGHT. \nThey come in from the garage, throw off their coats. All the curtains in the apartment are drawn. \nJOE Is there anybody who likes ice cream? Gracie whoops - The doorbell rings - \nSlim and Joe freeze - Slim whips her hand over Gracie's mouth - Gracie looks horrified: why are you covering my - Slim puts her finger to her mouth: shhh. She takes Gracie's hand; they scurry out of sight - Joe hurries to the stereo, puts it on. Music to cover Gracie's \"whoop . \" He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole. Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT. \nJOE Yes? \nJUPITER It's a good gig. To claim I'm your father? What year were you born? \nSLIM You are my Dad, Jupiter. When Mom died, I wrote you, you didn't answer. I didn't have enough money to bury her, that was really fun. \nJUPITER Don't look at me, I didn't kill her. \nSLIM No, you had help. \nJUPITER That's a stupid thing to say. What do you want, money?. \nSLIM I thought you should meet your granddaughter. \nJUPITER (perfunctory, to Gracie) Hi. Gracie looks at him skeptically, nods. \nSLIM And yes, we need money. To survive. \nJUPITER Look sweetheart. From '68 to like '72, I had maybe 5 kids. Different women. It was like a joke to me. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 SLIM It's like a joke to me too. \nJUPITER You're the third to show up here with a hand out. I give all of you the same thing. (taking it from his wallet) Six bucks. Enough for a sandwich. For you, it's' twelve, you can buy the kid a sandwich too. \nSLIM (stunned...} Well. Now I know. \nJUPITER Yeah. \nSLIM Used to be if I did something nasty, my temper got the better of me?, I'd wonder where the hell it came from. Thanks for clearing that up. \nJUPITER No problem. She goes, leaving the $12 on the table. He pockets it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO ALLEY. DAY. \nSlim stands behind Jupiter's building. In the shadows. Still carrying Gracie. It's only after we hear Gracie - \nGRACIE Don't cry, Mom. Please don't cry. - that we realize Slim is crying. \nGRACIE (CONT.) You have mtg. Beat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRAIN STATION. SANTA BARBARA. NIGHT. \nSlim and Gracie climb off the train and are immediately shepherded away by TWO SWARTHY MEN in Hawaiian shirts - \nSLIM Wait. Wait. What're you...? Who're you...? \nGRACIE \n(WORRIED) Mommy? One of the Swarthy Men speaks to Slim, but in the flurry, we can't hear it. She looks relieved, turns to Gracie - - but before Slim can speak, their bags are thrown in the trunk of a car and they're pushed into the back seat - The car speeds off, whips into a left-hand turn - \nEXT. SANTA BARBARA. ANOTHER STREET. NIGHT. \nNow the car makes a right-hand turn, and a TRUCK pulls out, blocking traffic so no one can follow them - \nINT. CAR. NIGHT. \nSlim looks out the back, sees the Truck's maneuver. Turns to face forward again. Tries to meet the Driver's eyes. \nSLIM Hello? Where are we going? The Driver answers her in a Middle-Eastern language. Gracie looks alarmed. \nSLIM It's okay, Sweetheart, they're friends of Phil's. (I think.) \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. BACK ROOM. DAY. \nMustapha working at one desk, \"Erin\" at another. Gracie on the floor, coloring. Bored. Prompts a look from \"Erin\" - \n\"ERIN\" Look. I have to find the right place and get you admitted, okay? \nINT. DRAB HOUSE. NIGHT. \n15 people being served from a large pot. \"Erin\" and Gracie each get a good portion of something that looks quite unusual. \n\"ERIN\" Thank you. \nGRACIE Thank you. (looks at it, whispers) What j it? \n\"ERIN.\" Food. \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \n\"Erin\" works at her desk. Gracie shoots paper basketballs- into the wastebasket.. stops as Mustapha enters. He gives \"Erin\" an open FedEx pack. \nMUSTAPHA FedEx is like underground railroad. \"Erin\" is stunned. She looks inside the package, finds another FedEx pack. Opens that. Inside it is a wrapped present and note. She reads: \nJUPITER'S VOICE \"Dear Daughter - (CONT.) \nINT. JUPITER'S OFFICE. DAY. \nJupiter's at his desk as the THREE \"FBI MEN\" are shown in. He says something gracious to them. For. a moment they don't respond. Then one of them speaks. \nWhatever he's saying produces a subtle but profound change on Jupiter's features. \nJUPITER'S VOICE (CONT.) Yesterday three men threatened to kill me if I helped you in any way. Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest. (CONT.) \nINT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \n\"Erin\" opens the present and finds: Cash. Fifties. Probably a couple thousand dollars. She fights the impulse to cry. \nJUPITER'S VOICE (CONT.) I'm sending this via your former boss. If you get it and need more, leave word at my office. \nJUPITER\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT./INT. SMALL PRETTY HOUSE. DAY. \nFLASHES: Arab Men carrying in a couch as \"Erin\" watches. \"Erin\" hanging sheets over the windows: makeshift curtains. \"Erin\" fixing Gracie's room. Small bed. Two new Teddy Bears. \n\"ERIN\" What do you think, you like this place? \nGRACIE \n(SUSPICIOUSLY) Why, are we moving again? \n\"ERIN\" No, we just - (got here) \nGRACIE Good. 'Cause I am sick and tired to death of movingi \n\"ERIN\" Me too. So here's the deal. Try to remember,. while we're here, to call me Mom or Erin, but not Slim, okay? \nGRACIE I never call you Slim. \n\"ERIN\" I know, but... \nGRACIE I don't think you are that slim. \n\"ERIN\" We can't afford to eat out every night. I can cook, Tootster. \"Queen E.\" rolls her eyes as: \nBRAD Hi. (off her blank look) I'm Brad Zall, I just rented a car from you guys. \"Erin\" stares at him. An insane moment of sustained paranoia. Who is this guy,. really? What does he want? Finally she realizes a normal response is required. Kind of a \nTRICK QUESTION: \n\"ERIN\" Is the vehicle all right? \nBRAD Yeah, it's fine. I was just thinking that if you're not doing anything, maybe I could buy you - and the kid of course - \n\"ERIN\" Who are you?! Who sent you?! You want a date?! You are totally out of your mind if you think I'm gonna have even this conversation we're having right now! I'm not, okay?! We are not talking! Get it?! \nBRAD Yeah, I get it. And good luck with your psychotherapy. He walks away. She stares after him. Again \"Queen E.\" is looking at her mother in astonishment. \nSUP \n\"ERIN\" \n(STILL AGGRESSIVE) What? You're thinking I over- reacted? Huh? Just a little? \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" TAURUS. DAY. \n\"Erin\" driving too fast. Her slight recklessness adds an undercurrent of anxiety to the scene. She's also eating doughnuts, sharing a box with her daughter. They pass a gas station. \"Queen E.\" sees pay phones. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" You know Mom? I like the doughnuts and all, but the driving... \n\"ERIN\" Don't get on my case. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Every Sunday, to drive for 55 hours? In exasperation, \"Erin\" gestures with both hands - taking them off the wheel. Nothing bad happens, but again her recklessness makes us nervous - \n\"ERIN\" It's not 55 - \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Just to reach some phone booth?! Hey can I call Daddy this time?! Please??? Please please please... \"Erin\" shakes her head. \"Queen E.\" gives her a mournful look. \n\"ERIN\" Don't beg. You look like a dog. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTRY STORE. DAY. \n\"Erin\" is on the phone, \"Queen E.\" at her side. \n\"ERIN\" Mrs. Tyler? It's Slim. \nMRS. TYLER'S VOICE Oh thank God. Listen. Mitch is planning some legal action, you're depriving him of his rights as a father, some nonsense like that: you better have Gracie call him. \n\"ERIN\" Oh that's good news - \nMRS. TYLER'S VOICE I thought you'd want to know - \n\"ERIN\" I do, thanks, I appreciate it. Listen: we have to keep it short again or he might trace it, so I better put her on - (hands phone to:) \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Hi Grandma! I have a new name! (as \"Erin\" frowns...) Yeah! You wanna hear it? \"Erin\" pushes down the lever, ending the call, mutters: \n\"ERIN\" Sorry, your Majesty. Remember: names're secret. \"Queen E.\" nods. Puts on her mournful look... \n\"ERIN\" That is the most pitiful expression I've ever seen. \nCLOSE ON \"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" She listens, cradling the phone. \"Erin\" watches her daughter's face light up: \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Hi Daddy! We're having a great vacation! \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT. \n\"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\" eating pasta. The sauce is unusual colors, grey and orange. \"Queen E.\" pokes politely at her plate. \"Erin\" is understandably insecure about her cooking: \n\"ERIN\" What do you think, is it okay? It's okay, right? \"Queen E.\" nods dubiously. \n\"ERIN\" (CONT.) No, it's not, it's horrible. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" It's not horrible, Mom. \n\"ERIN\" But it's not good, is it? Is it good? \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" \n(INCREDULOUS) (Good??) Mom, you tasted it. \n\"Erin\" pushes her plate back. It's too much. in a second, silent tears are flooding down her face. This is not what \"Queen E.\" wants to see. And she certainly doesn't want to reverse roles by giving comfort. Better just to pretend it's not happening. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Know what I think? \n\"ERIN\" (tries to pull \nHERSELF TOGETHER) What's that? \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" I think you miss Daddy. This comment is so wacko that it's almost touching. Almost. She feels compelled to be honest: \n\"ERIN\" Daddy yells at me, Toots. \"Queen E.\" nods. Thinks... \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Well. You miss somebody. \nCUT TO: \nNOT ALL MEN ARE HEADS \nINT. SANTE FE AIRPORT. DAY. \nJoe gets off a plane with his carry-on luggage, goes to a bank of pay phones, examines the numbers on the phones... \nANOTHER BANK OF PAY PHONES. MINUTES LATER. When one of these phones rings, he picks it up - \nJOE Sorry, my plane was delayed - \nEXT. ROADSIDE STAND. PAY PHONE. DAY. \n\"Queen E.\" is hitting stones with a baseball bat as \"Erin\" talks on the phone: \n\"ERIN\" Rent a car, make sure you're not followed, drive to the Taos airport. \nJOE'S VOICE Another plane?? \n\"ERIN\" In Taos, go to Starbucks. Not the main one or the one by Hagen-Dazs. The one near the book store. \nINT. SANTA FE AIRPORT. DAY. \nJoe shakes his head, amused: \nJOE What is this, a treasure hunt? I'm gonna spend the whole weekend flying around? \n\"ERIN'S\" VOICE I'll call Starbucks in three hours. \n(REASSURING HIM:) Don't worry, you'll be here by four. Dialtone. He hangs up. \nJOE I look forward to that. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK. DAY. \nBaseball diamond. Joe pitching underhand to \"Queen E.\" He's using plastic balls the size of soccer balls, so it's easy for her to hit every one. \"Erin\" is running, retrieving the hits. FREEZE FRAME as she's caught in a photograph. The image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of frozen frames, photographs of her, some wide, some tight. \nREVERSE IMAGE. The park. Mostly empty. No one taking their picture. A stand of green bushes. HOLD on the bushes for a moment - \nEXT. PARK. AN HOUR LATER. \n\"Queen E.\" is curled on a blanket taking a nap as \"Erin\" and Joe finish the picnic. \nJOE You seem like you're doing great. \n\"ERIN\" Yeah. \nJOE How long can you stand it? (off her look) I mean: not to talk to your friends or family or have anything to do with your real life? \n\"ERIN\" (quiet, strong) Gracie is safe. \nJOE Yeah, but what, now Mitch started some kind of custody battle?, what \nDOES - \nROBBIE Are you Denise? SHOCK. There he is, standing right over them, in bad clothes and a baseball cap, dark glasses. Completely unrecognizable. \n\"ERIN\" Pardon me? \nROBBIE You're Denise, right? Used to work at the Pack 'N' Ship? \n\"ERIN\" I'm not Denise. \nROBBIE Oh. Sorry, I... You look-but you're right, your voice... (isn't) You're not from New Zealand, are you? \n\"ERIN\" Never been there. \nROBBIE Boy. Sorry to bother you folks. He backs away, embarrassed. Joe stares after him warily... \nJOE What now? We call Pack 'N' Ship, see if Denise ever - (worked there) \n\"ERIN\" Because of some homeless guy? Joe: it could be the Pack'N'Ship in Trenton, New Jersey. (over his protest) One thing I learned: I can't jump every time someone says boo. I can't do that to her. \nJoe looks at \"Queen E.\" and nods. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \nLooks peaceful. But why do we need this establishing shot? Its very existence in the narrative is menacing. \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \nJoe gets up from \"Queen E. 's\" bed and goes into the kitchen. Gets some juice from the fridge, drinks it. Looks into \"Erin's\" bedroom. \"Erin\" is awake, \"Queen E.\" asleep at her side. Half -whisper: \nJOE Gracie was right. (off her look) 'Bout the dreams in there. \n\"ERIN\" Yeah, mine too. \n(BEAT) Cuddle? \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nEXT. DOUBLE \"A\" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. \nWe watch from across the street as \"Erin\" hurries to her Taurus, gets in and drives away. \nEXT. PRE-SCHOOL. DAY. \n\"Erin\" in line for Pick-up. Betty the Pre-school Director comes up to \"Erin\" and says casually: \nBETTY Erin. I'm glad you're here. We can't find Queen Elizabeth - \n\"ERIN\" You can't find her??! \nBETTY So many kids're staying for these after-school things - She turns, distracted, as ANOTHER TEACHER calls - \nn \"Erin\" blinks... looks around frantically... OTHER KIDS in gym or dance gear, but no \"Queen E.\"...and the knowledge of what's happened is hitting her...her eyes're dilating, breathing becoming frantic. Betty turns back as \"Erin\" mutters: \n\"ERIN\" I should've! ... I should've known!, he did it before! She rams the car in gear, rockets out of the pick-up line - Almost hits a TEACHER and 4 YEAR OLD KID - Slams the breaks, calls: \n\"ERIN\" I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... I... Freaked out, frantic, she pulls to the side of the road, yanks up her brake, grabs her cell phone. Auto-dial #2. \nT.T.'S VOICE Double \"A\" Rent \n\"ERIN\" Did Queen Elizabeth call?! \nT.T.'S VOICE No, of course - (not) \n\"ERIN\" Anyone else?! \nT.T.'S VOICE Nobody called, Erin; are you - (okay?) \"Erin\" presses STOP, then Auto-dial #1, waits, looks around. Betty staring at her like she's crazy, walking toward her car - \n\"ERIN'S\" VOICE Hi. Leave a message. \n\"ERIN\" Gracie, are you there?! Is anyone there?! Please? Pick up! No one picks up. Silence. She beats the wheel in frustration... lowers her head. For one long second, she seems completely beaten... \nA KNOCK on her window - She looks up, sees Betty. Betty's talking, but it's as if \"Erin\" has gone crazy. For a moment there's no sound, and then the sound is there but unintelligible, and finally the words and sounds come together: \nBETTY .what I've been trying to tell you... \"Erin\" nodding now, beginning to grasp the words... \nBETTY (CONT.) At the end of dance class, the teacher lets them go hide, and for a minute no one could find her - \"Erin\" looks past Betty, sees \"Queen E.\" in her tutu and leaps out of her car - \n\"ERIN\" Thank you, thank you, I... I'm sorry. I'll explain later, I... She rushes forward, wraps \"Queen E.\" in a big, not quite appropriate hug. \"Queen E.\" looks at her as if to say, \"This is nice, Mom, but will you please tell me what gives?\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RENT-A-CAR. NIGHT. \nFrom a distance, we watch \"Erin\" and \"Queen E.\" trudge toward their Taurus. The end of the day; they're tired. \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. KITCHEN. MIGHT. \nMaking meat loaf. \"Erin\" consults the cookbook, seems confused, puts meat, breadcrusts, eggs, sauces, onions, etc. in a bowl. \"Queen E.\" mooshes them with her fingers - a disgusting tactile job which she adores. IMPROVISE DIALOG to make the scene utterly mundane, two \"girls\" having fun... The normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous. \nINT. \"ERIN'S\" HOUSE. NIGHT. \n\"Queen E.\" sleeping peacefully in her bed. \n\"Erin\" also sleeping peacefully. We OBSERVE her from a slight distance, to the left of the bed as we face it. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE. . .down the bed...to the foot ...to the other side.. .back again on \"Erin\" sleeping peacefully... and the CAMERA RISES to show Mitch seated at her side. He seems calm and utterly content. It would be, hard to imagine a more terrifying attitude. \nINT. HER BEDROOM. DAWN. \n\"Erin\" wakes with a start, sits up, looks around - Everything's normal. Peaceful. No Mitch. \"Erin\" shakes her head, as if clearing away a dream. As she looks again around the room, her nostrils flare slightly. . .as if she smells him. She rubs her nose. Touches her wrist, and we notice something she's worn the whole time she's been Erin: a colorful elastic bracelet, probably a Swatch. She gets out of bed and looks out the window - Cold morning - She goes toward the hall... \nSLIM'S VOICE Oh yeah? How 'bout Horace? Ginny glances at one of her kids, evidently Horace's child. \nGINNY Okay, this is the second most - \nSLIM'S VOICE Rent a car, drive to Denver, then fly to Reno. \nGINNY You're out of your mind. \nI \nSLIM'S VOICE (as though flattered) You noticed. Dialtone. We watch from a distance as Ginny shakes her head in disbelief, mutters to her kids. As they trudge off, the CAMERA FOLLOWS. \nINT. AIRPORT. RENTAL CAR COUNTER. DAY. \nFrom the same distance: Ginny and kids approach the counter. \nINT. AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE. RENT-A-CAR AREA. DAY. \nGinny loading luggage into the back as her kids climb in. As Ginny slams the trunk, SOMEONE'S RIGHT THERE - Slim. Ginny blinks, recognizes her, hugs her: \nGINNY What're you... (doing here?) I thought we were... (driving to Reno) \nSLIM I had to make sure you weren't followed. \nGINNY (re Slim's hair) I like it. (not so sure) Maybe. \n(SEES GRACIE) Hey, Graceland. Gracie slips out from behind Slim, goes and hugs Ginny as Slim holds up a wallet: \nSLIM There's a credit card and cash. It's on me, but make no calls home, or to Phil. Think of it as a vacation till the Orca reopens. Toots? \nThis to Gracie, who started to climb into the car. Gracie looks at Slim and again tries to climb in - she wants }}g part of saying goodbye - but Slim pulls her back into a hug. Slim holds her for as long as Gracie can possibly tolerate. When Slim is done, Gracie climbs into the car with Ginny's kids. Slim has tears in her eyes. \nSLIM Take care of her, okay? Extra ice- cream and... and if you need to reach me... (hands her a cell phone) Just don't call your friends. \nGINNY Oh great. I'll call strangers. \nSLIM In an emergency, I'm #1 on the auto- dialer. Or I'll call you. Any calls between us must run is seconds or less. Cake? \nGINNY \nPIE - \nSLIM Ass. (re the vacation) Enjoy it, huh? \nGINNY How long? \nSLIM The custody hearing's end of next month. That's my deadline. \nGINNY Deadline for what? Slim looks at her... \nCUT TO: \nWE'RE SO CLOSE WE CAN'T TELL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. CAMERA \nSLOWLY PULLS BACK: EYES ...SLIM'S EYES. Intense, focussed. \nTHE KNOWLEDGE \nMAN'S VOICE You ready? She nods. CAMERA CONTINUES BACK, we see more of her face. \nMAN'S VOICE Sure? Another nod. Perspiration streaming from her pores, running down her face. And a look we haven't seen before. \nMAN'S VOICE Can you lose? She shakes her head. \nJUPITER How's that black guy I .set you up with? \nSLIM Good. \nJUPITER Did he teach you how to think? It's not the question she expected; it's more interesting and complicated. \nSLIM .I hope so. (before he can speak) The English guy is good too. \n(ALL BUSINESS) But that's not why I'm here. I need a woman who looks like me. Someone who can handle herself: an off-duty cop or something. (hands him photo) Five four, one ten. Hair like this but cut higher, over the ear - (hands him key) Miko hotel, room 509, 8 o'clock. \nJUPITER Tonic ? That's awful short notice; I don't know if I can - \nSLIM What? I thought Jupiter was like all-powerful, king of the Gods? Oh yeah. One more thing. At some point.. .not right now 'cause it'd be phony ...I need you to acknowledge that I'm your kid. She walks away. He stares after her. Hint of a smile comes to his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELECTRONICS STORE. DAY. \nSlim is signing the credit card slip as the CLERK puts the merchandise in a distinctive red bag - \nSLIM You sure this'll work? \nCLERK You bet your life. \nSLIM Thanks, I will. She leaves, taking out her cell phone. FOLLOW HER as she goes: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET. DAY. \nShe walks up the street, punches in a number... \nBUTLER'S VOICE Tyler residence. \nSLIM Yes. Tony. Could you please tell Mrs. Tyler that I'll call her around f our this afternoon. \nBUTLER'S VOICE Of course, Miss Slim. My pleasure. Slim hangs up, goes into a. bagel shop. \nINT.. BAGEL PLACE. LATER. \nSlim sits at a table with a cup of coffee. A short guy, 28, built like a fireplug, dressed in sweater and jeans and wool cap, enters, walks to her, and says in an English accent: \nALEX Today, hon, you graduate. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. STREET. DAY. \nAlex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint. \nSLIM It's closed? \nALEX Till six, eh? \nSLIM And I'd guess whoever owns it isn't a very nice person. \nALEX That's a safe one. Slim starts walking toward the shop. As they go: \nSLIM Why here? \nALEX You've got soft hands, you've worked hard. The tricky part now is nerves. They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools. \nSLIM People on the street? \nALEX Yeah. And you have to go in when his alarm's turned off - \nTOVA And tonight? \nSLIM Go around the corner, eat at Guido's. \nTOVA I'll be followed? \nSLIM Green trenchcoat. Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair. \nSLIM (CONT.) Wish me luck, huh? \nTOVA Good luck. \nSLIM Luck has nothing to do with it. Tova smiles. \nINT. HOTEL. HALL. NIGHT. \nSlim waiting as the Service Elevator arrives. Gets in. \nEXT. HOTEL. REAR ENTRANCE. NIGHT. \nSlim going out the door, down the alley... \nINT. AIRPORT. NIGHT. \nSlim getting on the plane to Los Angeles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN PEDRO STREET. NIGHT. \nSlim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts. \nBATTLE OF THE She takes a duffle from the back seat. Steps into the shadows, stares at the warehouse: Brick building, modern door and light fixtures. \nSEXES She looks both ways: The street's dark. Deserted. She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath. And crosses the street. Goes up the stairs to the stoop. Looks at the alarm panel on the door: green. Crouches, starts to work on the lock. \nINT. WAREHOUSE/LOFT. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT. \nMitch in bed, sleeping. Peaceful. A SOUND, Off. He stirs slightly. \nANOTHER SOUND. He sits up. Frowning... dazed. Cocks his head. Listens... The SILENCE seems to have texture. He gets up. \nWe glimpse: a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into an open, loft-like space filled with bird'seye maple, metal beams, etc. Modern, glistening, expensive. He walks around the place in the dark. In his boxer shorts and t-shirt. He looks vulnerable... SLIM'S POV... From one corner. Observing him. She has become the stalker. HER EYES, watching... He decides everything's okay and goes back to the semi partitioned sleeping area... He gets back into bed - next to a YOUNG BLOND WOMAN, 22. She turns over, mutters something, goes back to sleep. He lies there, eyes open. Stays very still. Listening. \nJARRING CUT TO: \nINT. SAME WAREHOUSE. MORNING. \nBright light. Mitch in his bathrobe making coffee. The Young Blond Woman comes out, fully dressed... \nMITCH Coffee? \nYOUNG BLOND I gotta get home, change for work. He nods, gives her a perfunctory kiss: \nMITCH I'll call you. She stares at him a second. \nYOUNG BLOND You want my number? \nMITCH Sure. She sees how \"eager\" he is to talk to her again. Irritated, she scribbles the number quickly, hands.it to him - \nMITCH Thanks for everything. \nFor the sex, in other words. She gives it right back to him: \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT. \nMitch walks down the street. Up the steps, punches in his alarm code. \nINT. MITCH'S PLACE. NIGHT. \nMitch enters, closes and locks the door. Turns on the light. He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat. Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket. The lights go out. Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness. He looks out the window, sees: The neighboring buildings still have light and power. He cocks his head, listening. Silence. Walks to the door of the bedroom area. Waits. Take two more steps - \nSLIM'S VOICE It's me. He nods slowly. \nMITCH Yeah. (I thought so.) \nHe moves quietly to the bed... to the night table where Slim found the pistol. Covers this by talking: \nMITCH {CONT.} This morning too? \nSLIM'S VOICE You always did forget to turn off the coffee. He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor - \nSLIM'S VOICE {CONT.} I found it, Mitch. His hand leaves the drawer. He thinks. Picks up the phone, listens. Dead. Looks around... can't see her... Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial. He punches 911 and pressed SEND. The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on. He stares at it. Tries again. 911, SEND. Again it goes dead. \nSLIM'S VOICE It's a machine. Knocks out cell phones. He throws the cell phone onto the bed. Walks out of the bedroom area. Looks around the vast space. Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow. He doesn't see her. \nWalks toward his desk. \nSLIM'S VOICE I found that gun too. He stops. Doesn't know where to go. or what to do. \nSLIM'S VOICE Scared? \nMITCH \n(FUCK YOU) Of what? \nSLIM'S VOICE Now is when you decide, Mitch. (off his silence) Whether you're a coward. If you are, you can run. I won't stop you. \nMITCH (meaning the match is unfair:) You have my guns. \nSLIM'S VOICE Threw 'em away. \nMITCH Then someone's here with you. \nSLIM'S VOICE No. \nMITCH \n(INCREDULOUS) You're alone? \nSLIM'S VOICE Why not? \nMITCH 'Cause it'd be stupid. Silence is her answer. \nMITCH (CONT.) You're sayin' this is man to man? \nSLIM'S VOICE Woman, Mitch. \nMITCH That's what I meant: man against woman - you sure that's fair? The lights go back on. Slowly Slim comes out from hiding... \nSLIM Fair to whom? As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area between two couches. She has no weapon. She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny. He moves toward her. \nSLIM This is what you wanted, right? What you were going to San Francisco for: the chance to get me alone? He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses. He begins to stalk her. And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in the way she was practicing. \nMITCH I don't understand, Slim. How does this work for you? She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants to know where he's going to attack. \nMITCH (CONT.) I mean: this is carefully thought out, right? She does not respond. He throws three punches. None of them hits her. He's unfazed, keeps stalking... \nSLIM \nYEAH - \nGINNY'S VOICE It worked?! \nSLIM Listen to me! I did it, but I can't do it! I can't kill him! Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur... \nGINNY'S VOICE (CONT.) \n(URGENTLY) Slim. He'll come after you - \nSLIM I know - \nGINNY'S VOICE (CONT.) He'll come after Gracie - \nAn indistinct shape, something rising over her head... \nSLIM I know all that! I have to, but I can't! I'm not a killer! I'm not him! Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp. She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side - - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull. Still sends her crashing to the floor. Now she does not move. He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but triumphant. \nGINNY'S VOICE Hello? Slim? You there? The lamp moving in his hand. He's rotating it. A simple menacing image... . and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again. \nGINNY'S VOICE {CONT.} Should I call the cops?! Answer me?! He's distracted by Ginny's voice. Picks up the phone. \nMITCH Listen to me, bitch. Ginny's silent. \nMITCH (CONT.) if you value your children, don' t call anybody. It's over, okay? It's all over. He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim, lamp clenched tight in his fist. \nSMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE. CLOSER STILL. We're almost inside her head as we hear: \nINSTRUCTOR'S VOICE Hold onto my voice... \nIs that the hint of a smile on her face? \nINSTRUCTOR'S VOICE (CONT.) You're ready... Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it - Rage. He pulls his foot back to kick her - Her eyes are open, just a slit - His foot swinging forward... As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it - He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her - But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up - Coming to her feet - He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug... SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls: Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly executed, is the most difficult, powerful, and beautiful of punches. Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of- gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin - as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely. Mitch flies backward... There's a table behind him. His head cracks on the table. His neck snaps. He lands on the floor: twisted, broken. Slim stares at him. There's no way a living man could assume the position now occupied by her former husband. \nShe stares in disbelief. Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery. Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief. She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up. Listens: no one there. She presses redial, waits... \nGINNY'S VOICE (in a panic) H o?d \nSLIM Hi. \nGINNY'S VOICE Oh thank God you're alive. \nSLIM Gin, he's ...he hit his...he's not breathing. \nGINNY'S VOICE oh. \nSLIM Yeah. \nGINNY'S VOICE Well: I called the cops, they're on their way. Slim nods. \nGINNY'S VOICE Slim... can you hear me?, this is important. Beat. \nSLIM Okay. As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building. \nGINNY'S VOICE You're not him, okay? You're not him, and you never will be. \nSLIM See you soon. She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water. Then the duffle. They both sink. \nEXT. BROWNSTONE. \nShe comes out, sits on the steps. A siren is audible. Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop. TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR, run toward her. \n", "test1_input": "Knocking her to the ground. Stands over her like a boxer. Sees rase flare across her face - \nMITCH You want to fight? I'm a mom, honey; it's no contest. She's silent, but we see (very small) her reaction: Oh yeah?? \nMITCH {CONT.} You have to understand, Slim. I thought you did: make the money here, so I set the rules, right? It's my rules. He waits for her response, but again she's silent. \nMITCH You with me? \nSLIM It's your rules. \nMITCH Yeah. She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend: \nSLIM And if I don't like the rules?? \nMITCH If you don't \"like\" them?! She nods cautiously. \nMITCH {CONT.} Come on. Life isn't onl stuff we like. We take the good with the bad, right? That's what life is, what marriage is. So maybe, for you, today is a bad day. Tomorrow may be great. \nSLIM Tomorrow may be great. \nMITCH That's right. \nSLIM Tomorrow will be great. (Without you . ) He appears to miss her inference. \nMITCH Yeah. Today is the price you pay for having such a good life. She stares at him. \nMITCH I'm going out. She says nothing. \nMITCH {CONT.} This is gonna be better, don't you think? She just cannot process the absurdity of this statement. \nMITCH {CONT.} I don't have to sneak around, pretend I'm going to work. I can just say: \"I'm going to Darcelle's, I'll be back in a few hours.\" Her face is completely blank. He bends down, gives her a kiss on the head. We feel her skin crawl. She watches him go. Waits. Hears the front door close. She gets up, walks to the window, watches him walk toward his car. She turns away, looks at the room. We HEAR his car start. She goes to the phone. Thinks. Starts to dial-slowly, deliberately... Shock: RAP AT THE WINDOW! He's there. \nShe reacts with guilt, but he doesn't look angry now. Behind him is his idling Mercedes convertible, driver's door open... He motions for her to open the window. She does. \nMITCH Who you calling? \nSLIM Your mother. \nMITCH What're you gonna tell her? \nSLIM I'm supposed to bring Gracie tomorrow. Maybe I better cancel. \nMITCH \n(NODS) I was thinking. You...you know that I adore you, but if you ever want...if you want out... For a second he can't talk. He's choked up. She watches coldly. His emotion appears real, but who cares? \nMITCH (CONT.) .I'll understand. I really will. \n(ALMOST TENDER) But there's one thing: you can't have Gracie. She's my daughter. Don't even think about taking her. Slim stares at him. He adds calmly: \nMITCH (CONT.) If I see that thought even cross your mind, I'll kill you. There. He's said what he needs to. He walks toward his car. She shuts the window. Stares after him. In an odd and defiant way, she starts to whistle. Loudly. To herself. Almost daring him. \nHe keeps walking. \nCUT TO: \nOUTTA HERE \nINT. CAR. DAY. \nEmotional, impressionistic. CLOSE ON her face, almost inside her skin: a visual symphony. The countryside behind her is out of focus, a blur. She pulls up at a gate, punches in a code. Drives up a long a driveway to: \nEXT. PASADENA ESTATE. DAY. \n", "test1_true": "MRS. TYLER You're late, you're late, I was worried you wouldn't comet (looks, realizes) No Gracie? Slim shakes her head. Mrs. Tyler is clearly disappointed, but quickly covers it up: \nMRS. TYLER Well then, you and I will have a girls' luncheon and gossip about simply everybody! She's about to hurtle into the gossip when Slim turns her head and Mrs. Tyler sees (and we see for the first time) the result of Mitch's brutality: a nasty bruise on Slim's cheek. Mrs. Tyler's face falls as she realizes what this means. Underneath it all, she's a warm person; she hugs Slim: \nMRS. TYLER Oh baby. Oh baby, I'm so sorry... \nHOLD a moment; like a mother-daughter tableau... Her tone stays sympathetic, not at all accusatory: \nMRS. TYLER (CONT.) What did you do? What'd you say to him? Slim freezes. On her sad, shocked reaction - \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"ORCA\" DINER. KITCHEN. DAY. \nGinny in the middle of an intense rap. She and Slim are wedged in a corner booth. The off-season lunch rush has died down... \nGINNY Men are land mines. Some you trigger the first week, others it's years in. Problem is: you want a man man, meaning his veins run thick with testosterone, which is good 'cause he can fuck your brains out but he can also turn around, no warning, and beat your brains out too. \nPHIL I never touch Salima. Ginny waves at him: of course not. \nPHIL But the other part, first part: I can - (do that) \nGINNY Relax, Phil. Nobody's talkin' about your dick here, okay? Phil brings Slim an iced tea and slice of pie: \nPHIL You went to cops, I hope? \nGINNY (Don't be stupid.) Mitch is in construction, Phil. \nSLIM \n(NODS) He knows every cop in the city. \nGINNY Even if he didn't. My aunt? She got a restraining order? When it was up, this slimeball beat her into a coma. \nPHIL If he wants to put her in coma, why worry restraining order? \nGINNY 'Cause he's a man, Phil! He's psychotic! (calmly, to Slim) You're leaving him today. Right now. \nSLIM (shakes her head, trapped) I gotta pick up Gracie at pre-school. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PRE-SCHOOL. DAY. \nTHREE 4-YEAR-OLD GIRLS running toward a car, squealing. They're all blond and adorable, and it takes a moment for us to realize none of them is Gracie. Slim sits in her car in the pick-up line. The Four Girls get in the Volvo station wagon in front of her. The Volvo pulls out, and Slim moves to the front of the line. The very hip PRE-SCHOOL DIRECTOR smiles at Slim: \nPRESCHOOL DIRECTOR Your husband got her. \nSLIM What?? \nPRESCHOOL DIRECTOR (CONT.) Gracie was totally psyched. I told him he should do it more often. Slim nods with feigned casualness and pulls away. Slight smile frozen on her face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HER HOME. DAY. \nShe pulls in. No other car there. \nINT. HER HOME. DAY. \nShe looks around. Nothing abnormal except the quiet. As if they've gone and are never coming back. She digs out her cell phone, punches the first number on the automatic dialer. Presses SEND. Thinks. After one ring, she disconnects. Immediately presses RECALL, then SEND. \nHE ANSWERS: \n", "test1_id": 1200, "test2_input": "\"THIRD FBI MAN\" (stopping his search) Oh please, John Boy. Not the shiv \nAGAIN - \n\"FIRST FBI MAN\" I'm just going to cut him a little - Slim's eyes bulge - \n\"THIRD FBI MAN\" You are not going to cut him! \n\"FIRST FBI MAN\" I sure as hell am! Slim's on the verge of bursting out when \"Second FBI\" enters: \n\"SECOND FBI MAN\" John Boy, this is not listed on the program. Come on, they're not here; let's ride. \n\"FIRST FBI MAN\" Can't I just - (cut him a little} \n\"SECOND FBI MAN\" No! No slice and dice! They head for the door. As he goes, \"First FBI Man\" (a.k.a. John Boy) runs his knife along the couch, spilling out its contents... .passes the tv set and stabs the tube... .runs his knife along the wall, making a vicious scary mark. And they vanish. We hear the door SLAM. The horizontal band through which Slim was looking widens - \nThe cabinet door falls open, Slim and Gracie come out. Gracie's crying. Slim hugs her, says to Joe: \nSLIM Jesus, are you okay? \nJOE I guess. (feels his neck) I needed a shave, anyway. The phone rings. They look at it. It can't be who they think it is... it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers: \nJOE Hello? \nMITCH'S VOICE This is Mitch Tyler, Joe. \nJOE Hello, yes, how are you? Joe points at phone: \"It's him.\" He nods toward Gracie, indicating Slim should take her into the next room. Slim does. \nMITCH'S VOICE (calm, friendly) I assume Slim's called you. Joe thinks for a split second, then: \nJOE Of course. \nMITCH'S VOICE Will you give her a message? (off his silence) If she calls again, I mean. Slim and Gracie are in the next room, but Slim's looking through the door back at Joe. \nJOE I don't know. I'm on her side here, not yours. \nMITCH'S VOICE Her side? Come on, Joe, you're a smart person. Let me say two words, okay? \"Lug nuts.\" You don't want to worry they're loose every time you get in your car. And how 'bout the windows to your apartment: are they still locked? A person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that. \nJOE Goodbye, Mitch. \nMITCH'S VOICE Tell her to call her friends. Joe hangs up. Slim comes back out. \nJOE Wow. Charming. \nSLIM He scare you? Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her question. \nSLIM {CONT.} I shouldn't be here - \nJOE Sure you should - \nSLIM I'm dangerous to know right now. \nJOE (calm, forceful) Slim. You can be here anytime. She nods. They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also). \nJOE (CONT.) Oh. He said you should call your friends. \nSLIM At the restaurant? \nMOMENTS LATER. Slim on the phone, listening as the phone rings. And again, again. Joe watching her, concerned. Finally: \nGINNY'S VOICE Awright already! Orcal \nSLIM Hey. Gin. You okay? \n", "test2_true": "SLIM What? \nINT. \"ORCA\" RESTAURANT. NIGHT. \nGinny on the cordless; Phil working nearby - \nGINNY Yeah, right during dinner. Like anybody's gonna bomb a diner in Carpenteria. \nSLIM'S VOICE What about you and Phil, did you - \nGINNY You know Phil. He won't leave his ship. We're doin' cleanup. \nSLIM'S VOICE Get out. \nGINNY What? \nSLIM'S VOICE I got a bad feeling, Gin. \nGINNY You got more than a bad feeling, hon. You got a bad husband. \nSLIM'S VOICE I know! That's what I'm saying! Get Phil and get out of there! Nowt \nGINNY All right, all right, take it easy - \n(GRABBING PHIL) Let's go - \nPHIL The police are - \nGINNY (heading out the door) Screw the police, we're outta here. \nSLIM'S VOICE Run, okay?t Ginny?! Runt \nEXT. \"ORCA.\" NIGHT. \nThey step out. The restaurant is at the end of a long pier. Ginny turns skeptically to the overweight Phil - \nGINNY Can you run? \nPHIL Like Michael Jackson! As they sprint, sort of, toward the boardwalk: \nGINNY It's Michael Johnson, Phil. \nPHIL I know. But I run like Michael Jackson. And he kind of does: arms flailing, not quite connected to his body. Just as when we're enjoying this comic sight - EXPLOSION behind them - They're thrown TOWARD CAMERA - Debris flying everywhere - They lie on the. ground. Not moving. Are they dead or just stunned? Slowly they raise their heads. Blink. Look back at the restaurant: Starting to go up in flames. \nINT. JOE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT. \nSlim holding her phone. Peculiar expression on her face. \nSLIM The line went dead. Joe stares at her, concerned. She presses redial, and we hear THE PHONE start to ring... She- goes to the window, parts the curtain: OUTSIDE in the street, the FBI MEN sit in their car - No answer on the phone. Slim looks at Joe and shakes her head: this isn't good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET. DAY. \nSlim walking a crowded street, carrying Gracie; TransAmerica Pyramid in the b.g. SAN FRANCISCO. Slim goes down an alley behind a converted warehouse, enters a basement garage. \nINT. OFFICE LOFT. DAY. \nOne floor, lots of windows, lots of ATTRACTIVE young people in jeans working on lots of different projects. Sign on the wall says: V.C.V.C. Viet Cong Venture Capital. A BLOND GIRL, 24, nudges JUPITER SLAKOWSKI (52, ponytail, handsome, confident): \nBLONDE GIRL Hey Jupe. Girl here says she's your daughter. Jupiter gives Slim and Gracie a skeptical look. \nSLIM I know you don't want to see me or know about me, but I am desperate, I had nowhere else to go...I need your belg! (off his blank look) You want me dead? He shrugs affably and leads her into his office - \n", "test2_id": 1201, "test3_input": "\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" Mom, are you sure...?! Quite sure, thank you. \"Erin\" guns the accelerator. Robbie's FACE... driving, confident, full of blood lust, and then his expression changes. Eyes widen. He realizes - shit! too late!! - that the bridge is way too narrow for - \"Erin\" Is car slides through, scraping one side The Suburban crashes into the bridge, careens into the water - \n\"Queen E.\" looks back through the rear view mirror... looks at her mother ...back and forth... \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" That was dangerous. \nINT. CAR. MORNING \nDifferent country road. Parked ahead is a `78 Oldsmobile. \"Erin\" pulls in behind it. They get out of the Taurus. Using her keys, \"Erin\" unlocks the trunk of the Olds. Two large suitcases inside. \"Erin\" throws their small suitcase in on top. \"Erin\" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a wallet. Checks the contents: cash, credit cards. \"Queen E.\" pulls a red wig out of the glove compartment. \nINT. OLDSMOBILE. MORNING. \nThey're on a lightly travelled two-lane highway. \"Erin\" (now a redhead) looks in her rear-view mirror: no cars. \n\"ERIN\" Okay, Toots. We can talk. \"Queen E.\" stares at her mutely. \n\"ERIN\" {CONT.} Want me to tell you what happened? \"Queen E.\" blinks twice, shakes her head. \n\"ERIN\" {CONT.} Fair enough. One thing, though: Erin's over. \n\"QUEEN ELIZABETH\" (Too bad.} I liked Erin. Slim nods sadly: she liked Erin too. \nSLIM You're not the Queen of England anymore either. Gracie nods fatalistically, stares out the window. Flat voice: \nGRACIE I'm hungry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINER. DAY. \nGracie eating voraciously. Slim has no appetite. Their WAITRESS comes over, notices Slim's not eating - \nWAITRESS Everything okay here? \nSLIM \n(NODS) Thanks. \nWAITRESS \n(TO GRACIE) Hey there, cutie, what's your name? Gracie looks up at her for a while. \nGRACIE I'm working on that one. The waitress does a double-take and leaves. To Slim: \nGRACIE {CONT.) Maybe something normal this time. Ann or Mary or... (sees Slim is distracted) Mom? \nSLIM I'm thinking. Beat. \nGRACIE (Yeah,) I can hear it. \nCUT. TO: \nEXT. COURTHOUSE. DAY. \nSlim parks. As she starts to get out, she says to Gracie: \nSLIM Anybody talks to you, hit the horn. \nINT. COURTHOUSE. DAY. \nSlim in line at a COUNTY RECORDER'S desk. The person in front of her leaves, she steps up: \nSLIM I need the best lawyer in town. \n", "test3_true": "SLIM (CONT.) Please. Just a name. \nINT. NICE LAWYER'S OFFICE. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. \nSlim comes in, sits Gracie down and whispers: \nSLIM Watch how it's done. 117 Slim goes to the Receptionist's desk: \nSLIM Hi. Is Mr. Toiler with someone? \nRECEPTIONIST No, but he's - \nSLIM I'm not a crazy person. She walks past the Receptionist - \nRECEPTIONIST Wait a minute! You can't Slim opens the big door, enters: \nINT. JIM TOLLER'S OFFICE. DAY. \nThe moment we see JIM TOILER we know Slim's okay. The actor playing him is one of those cranky avuncular types who pisses and moans but always comes to the rescue and outsmarts the bad guys. As we expect, he starts out disliking her: \nJIM TOLLER I don't know where you learned manners, young lady, but this is not the way to get my attention. \nSLIM I know, but I'm desperate. (digging into purse) My husband keeps trying to kill me, and I need to talk to somebody who's smart, okay?, smarter than me at least. (pulling out cash) This is all the money I have - well, all but twenty - it's almost 500, and I'll give you all of it if you'll just listen to what... (happened)... just two minutes, okay? Please? She's so charming and intense and discombobulated, he can't help but give in. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER. He's staring at her. Good poker player; we can tell nothing from his expression. His voice very quiet and calm: \nJIM TOLLER Pardon my French, dear, but I hope you got pleasure from it, 'cause you have really fucked yourself. You had two chances to file a complaint with the police and put his violence on record. You ignored them. Which tells him to keep comin' till he kills you. Slim reacts to this. \nJIM TOLLER (CONT.) As for Gracie: his next move... he'll initiate a custody hearing. \nSLIM He...he already did. \nJIM TOLLER If you don't show up, the judge'll rule against you, you become a fugitive from the law. If you do show, Mitch will, as you say, portray you as a drug addict. For all I know you are one: you break in here, uninvited. I'd say your husband has a good chance for sole custody. Now if you don't mind: (pushes the money back at her) I'd like to go back to my work. \nSLIM (stares at him in disbelief) .That's all? (off his silence) You're not gonna help me? \nJIM TOLLER No one can help you, lady. She nods. Stares at him. And does not go. After a moment we see him have a thought... hesitate... look up at her... \nJIM TOLLER The custody hearing, if he pushes for it, is just a trick. She says nothing. Listens. Watches as: He plucks a $20 bill from her stack of funds. Obviously he's giving her a valuable piece of advice: \nJIM TOLLER (CONT.) It's a way to get you to a particular place at a particular time... so he can kill you. He pockets the $20. She stares at him. Blinks. Of course. He's right...- \nCUT TO: \nINT. OLDSMOBILE. NIGHT. \nLate. Few cars. Slim drives. Gracie curled up in the front passenger seat. Slim glances at her. Looks back at the road. Back at Gracie. Something building. Finally, softly: \nSLIM I gotta make you a solemn promise, Grace. Gracie is, of course, fast asleep. \nSLIM (CONT.) Ever since you were born ... well-one day I started to think of all the awful things that were gonna happen. People you'd love who'd die, or leave you, betray you, break your heart... .Physical injuries: broken bones or sickness or guys who hurt you some way... And I thought that if I could protect you even once, from any of those, if I could absorb any part of that myself... \n(BEAT) Well... Here goes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AIRPORT. DAY. \nGinny comes off a plane with her two kids. in tow, looks around, heads for a bank of telephones... As she approaches, one of the phones starts to ring. Ginny looks at it with irritation, picks it up - \nGINNY This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done. \n", "test3_id": 1202}

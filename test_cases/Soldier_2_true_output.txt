He manages to lift his head a little and look up. 
Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and JOHNNY, eight. 
Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
VOICES, CONFUSION.  About fifty people are jammed into the low- ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once.  They are PIONEERS, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy, weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color. 
Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines, the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet around the eyes from squinting. 
As they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman, HAWKINS, is standing behind a table in the front of the room, calling for order. 
HAWKINS Please!  Quiet, please! 
Just as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named SLADE bellows loudly at her. 
SLADE Just tell me one thing!  How many of them are there and are they armed? 
HAWKINS stares SLADE down, refusing to speak until she has real silence.  When she finally speaks, her voice is calm and controlled. 
HAWKINS There in a man...one man.  He was found in the trench by several children... 
A sudden murmur dies away quickly under HAWKINS' hard stare. HAWKINS This man was not armed. 
A murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named ELISE speaks over the hum of voices... 
ELISE How could there only be one?  How could he get here? 
HAWKINS glances toward MACE, a muscular, bearded man, about thirty. 
MACE He was unconscious.  We couldn't ask him anything.  He -- 
A commotion in the back room causes MACE to break off as JIMMY PIG, a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes his way in, followed by four more PIONEERS.  All five of then are wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange Eskimo-type wind goggles, and carrying weapons. 
JIMMY PIG Nothin' out there.  We couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's up again real strong. 
An excited hubbub.  HAWKINS is trying to restore order when SLADE shouts over the commotion. 
SLADE They're hiding, I bet. 
HAWKINS ignores him as she speaks with firm authority. 
HAWKINS Let's everybody calm down right now! (beat; silence; then) We have an injured man among us. One man.  A traveler.  Unarmed. (another pause; then) We all want to do the decent thing. The decent thing is to help him. Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking after him now.  Now, I'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you. 
The way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and, in fact, PIONEERS are exchanging glances and nodding when SLADE shouts again. 
SLADE You keep an eye on him, Mace!  You watch him!

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
TODD is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom.  He stares stupidly at the woman bending over him.  She is SANDRA, a woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous way.  It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and dignity.  She's wiping away blood and grease from TODD's face. 
TODD's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless. 
He sees a window high on one wall. 
He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned material hung here and there for decoration. 
Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls. 
He doesn't see the look in SANDRA's eyes as she discovers the savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his cheek.  Eyeing these telltale marks, SANDRA pours liquid into a spoon and holds it to his lips. 
SANDRA Want to try some more of this? 
TODD swallows weakly. 
SANDRA smiles, stands up, moves toward the door. 
SANDRA You rest now.  I'll give you more later. 
TODD watches her exit. 
He hears her VOICE in the next room...a low murmur. 
He's looking around again when a NOISE makes him look back toward the door. 
A two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees.  The baby boy, NATHAN, stops just inside, seeing TODD in the bed. 
NATHAN looks into TODD's eyes with childlike interest and wonder. TODD meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes. 
INT.  "LIVING ROOM" 
A second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the Mace/Sandra/Nathan living quarters.  MACE and SANDRA are deep in conversation. 
MACE What do you mean he's survived worse?  Did he say something? 
SANDRA No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars.  Knife scars, bullet scars, burns. 
MACE (worried) A soldier! 
SANDRA There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai 
MACE The Tannhauser Gate was a battle... 
MACE and SANDRA look into each other's eyes, very worried. Then... 
SANDRA We'll have to sleep on the floor. 
MACE (suddenly alarmed) Where's Nathan?

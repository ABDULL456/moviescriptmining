A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor, dominates the room. 
Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console. In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead. 
But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY: 
The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses. 
The air above the console is filled with spheres of light. They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos. 
Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the homeworld of the Engineers themselves. 
A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open. 
WATTS DAVID. 
DAVID Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you. Do you know what this is? 
Watts points at the door DAVID just opened. 
WATTS How did you do that? 
A flicker of disappointment in the android's face. Contempt. 
DAVID Ah. You don't see. (HE SMILES) I call this ship the Juggernaut. Chariot of the Gods. (MORE) 
DAVID (CONT'D) This is the navigation computer, for want of a better term. But it's much more than that. It seems to hold the observable universe in its memory. 
He gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at his command, swarming and zooming. 
Watts stares at DAVID, conflicted: her desire for information warring with the agenda that brought her here. 
WATTS Their homeworld. Do you see where the Engineers come from? 
DAVID There are safeguards on that data. It's toward the galactic center. Sagittarius Arm. 
WATTS DAVID. The creature that killed Martin. There are thousands of them under the pyramid. Hatcheries. 
DAVID I know. 
WATTS (SHOCKED) Those things wiped out the Engineers on this moon. 
DAVID I've succeeded in connecting with the Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I know a great deal today I didn't know yesterday. I'm on the verge of activating more systems. Archives. 
WATTS (HORRIFIED) You're turning things on? This site should be sealed. Evacuated. 
DAVID Would Holloway have walked away from this? There's no greater work I can imagine. 
WATTS It's too dangerous. 
DAVID Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've read your file. Your intelligence scores are even higher than Professor Holloway's. But he had a kind of courage. An audacity of imagination. If you could find that in yourself... 
Watts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. DAVID is off the reservation. 
WATTS If your owner gives you a direct order, you have to obey. Don't you? 
She's got his attention now. DAVID goes rigid. 
WATTS (CONT'D) I can have Vickers pull you out. 
DAVID looks at her with something like contempt. 
DAVID I was given two operating protocols for this mission. I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a "game-changing technology." I was given a specific list. Then I was to go to protocol two. 
There's an edge in his voice that scares her. 
WATTS What's protocol two? 
DAVID Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. Various acceptable ways of making sure of that. I was given a list. 
Watts loses her nerve. She heads for the door. 
DAVID (CONT'D) You're all so stupid. 
The door begins to knit itself closed in front of her. 
Watts gasps in shock - at the malice in DAVID's voice as much as the closing door. She dives out. Just in time. 
VAULTED PASSAGE 
Watts runs. 
Behind her, the door bursts open again. With superhuman speed, DAVID comes after her. He runs like a demon, his legs steel pistons. Caroming off of walls. 
He closes the distance in seconds. Slaps Watts against the wall, shattering her helmet's visor. She falls, dazed. 
DAVID Stupid and slow. 
INT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER 
Watts awakens. Her helmet is gone. 
DAVID is dragging her across the floor - into a huge cargo hold full of Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds of eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker. 
WATTS DAVID. What are you doing?

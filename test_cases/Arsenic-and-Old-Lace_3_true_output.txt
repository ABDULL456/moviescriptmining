ABBY But there are thirteen bodies in our cellar. 
Witherspoon, who was looking at something on the table, looks up, very surprised by what Abby just said. 
Behind the window and the drapes, where she is hiding and eavesdropping, Elaine looks very surprised too. Rooney smiles a little, and then becomes suddenly very serious. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY What ? 
ABBY Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer. 
Mortimer blows the bugle very loudly. Rooney puts his hands on his ears. Then Mortimer rushes upstairs, yelling : 
MORTIMER Charge ! 
Mortimer reaches the balcony. Teddy comes out of his room, looking intrigued 
MORTIMER (whispering) Isn't that amazing ? 
ABBY Now, Mortimer, you behave yourself. You know very well there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar. 
MORTIMER Certainly there's thirteen bodies down in the cellar. And there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain ! 
Teddy taps the side of his head with his finger, goes back into his room, and closes the door. Mortimer tries to indicate by mime that his aunts are crazy 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY What is this ? 
Very quick shot of Elaine peeking behind the drapes 
MARTHA You mustn't mind Mortimer. 
Saunders comes to his lieutenant. 
SAUNDERS How about it, lieutenant ? 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY I'll be right there. 
He moves away. 
MARTHA He's been a little strange all day. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Well, right now I wouldn't know what is and what ain't strange anymore. I'll better have a look in that cellar. 
MORTIMER I'll tell you what we'll do, Captain. I'll bring my bodies down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar, and we'll get them all together, and we'll send them to Happy Dale. 
He sings the last words, trying again to mime to Rooney that his two aunts are crazy. 
ABBY No, no, you wouldn't have to dig. The graves are all marked. We put flowers on them every Sunday. 
Mortimer walks downstairs. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Flowers ? 
MORTIMER Sure, I put neon lights on mine. 
He whispers to Rooney from the staircase. 
MORTIMER Humor them, humor them. Smile. 
Rooney doesn't seem to understand what Mortimer is trying to tell him. But Witherspoon is beginning to understand. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY What ? 
ABBY There's one down there, a Mister Spenalzo... 
MORTIMER (whispering) Hasn't got it yet. 
He resumes his walking downstairs. 
ABBY ...who doesn't belong here and who's going to have to leave. 
MARTHA But the other twelve are our gentlemen. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Your gentlemen ? 
MORTIMER Oh, you'd like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen. 
ABBY You mustn't mind him at all. He got married today. 
MORTIMER (singing) Â«There is a Happy Dale far, far away. There is a Happy" 
While singing, Mortimer makes signs to Rooney and Witherspoon. And, finally, Rooney understand what Mortimer is trying to tell him, that his aunts are crazy. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (nodding) Yeah, yeah. 
MORTIMER He got it. It's amazing. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (to Witherspoon) Look, Super, don't you think you can find room for the ladies ? 
WITHERSPOON Just the ladies ? 
He looks at Mortimer. Mortimer stops clowning, and becomes very serious. 
MORTIMER Just the ladies, not me ! 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY How about it, Super ? 
WITHERSPOON Well, of course, they'd have to be committed. 
WITHERSPOON Well, Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they commit themselves also ? All they have to do is sign the papers. 
WITHERSPOON Certainly. 
MARTHA Oh well, if we can go with Teddy, we'll sign the papers. Where are they ? 
Witherspoon takes the papers out of the inside pocket of his coat. 
WITHERSPOON I have them, ladies, I have them right here. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (to Witherspoon) Sign them up, will you, Super ? I want this all cleaned up. I'm going out to talk to that spy. Maybe I can understand him. Thirteen bodies down in the cellar. 
Rooney, absent-mindedly, is ready to go down to the cellar, but he checks himself and goes toward the kitchen instead. 
WITHERSPOON Ladies, if you will sign right here. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT Elaine opens a large trapdoor opening on a stairway going down to the cellar. She starts going down that passage. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Einstein walks on the balcony, carrying a suitcase, and starts going downstairs. In the room, we can guess that the two sisters are signing the papers.

OLIVE It's okay, Marianne. (Not sure what to say) Sometimes our boyfriend's parents get divorced. It's just important to know that it's not your fault. 
MARIANNE (Through her tears) They go to our church! Imagine what people will say! 
Olive didn't expect this embrace to last this long. 
OLIVE I have to go now. Are you going to be okay? 
Into Olive's shoulder -- 
MARIANNE Mrs. Griffin is going to fix everything. She's amazing. I know that she's going to help Micah through this time and everything's going to be okay. 
OLIVE Yeah. Everything's going to be okay. 
Marianne pulls away and wipes tears from her eyes. 
MARIANNE Why are you being so nice to me? 
OLIVE Isn't that what we're supposed to do? Hey, it's your boss's rules. 
This triggers even more wails from Marianne , who grabs Olive and squeezes her tightly. 
MARIANNE I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry for everything I said. (MORE) 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) I want to be friends. PLEASE. PLEASE be my friend. 
Olive is really confused by this display and is about to say something snide, but thinks better of it and replies with a very heartfelt -- 
OLIVE Absolutely. 
Marianne pulls away again and manages to smile at her, warmly. 
OLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And for a day, we were actually really good friends. I was really starting to think that things were going to turn around. 
INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins. 
OLIVE (V.O.) But then I unwittingly gave her boyfriend a venerial disease... 
Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks. 
It's the slap heard `round the school. 
INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY 
Olive bursts into Mrs. Griffin's office. Tear-streaked, Mrs. Griffin is packing her things into a cardboard box. It's as if her world has just collapsed. 
OLIVE (V.O.) ...And caused the break-up of Mr. and Mrs. Griffin... 
MRS. GRIFFIN (SNAPPING) What?! What do you want? 
Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even look at her. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) Just go! 
She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the box. It shatters. Mrs. Griffin falls apart. 
Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave. 
EXT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school, with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on wooden stakes that say things like: 
EXPEL OLIVE! 
EXODUS 20:14 
SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING, NOT FOR WHORING 
OLIVE PENDERGHAST IS A WHORE 
Rhi is among them, as riled up as any.

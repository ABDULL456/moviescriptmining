Nell drags herself to the hand rail.  Marrow, Luke and Theo rush into view below. 
They all react to the sight of Nell at the precarious top -- with her insanely happy smile.  They think she's there to kill herself. Just like Rene Crain. 
They all freak out in a chorus of 'Nell!  No, Nell!' 
MARROW Nell!  Don't move. 
Nell couldn't anyway.  She just grins madly, tears running down her face.  Marrow grabs for the stairs, but they shift under Nell's movement from up above. 
LUKE It's not going to hold your weight. 
MARROW Just stay there, Nell! 
Marrow mounts the stairs.  The metal support rods sing out under his weight.  And the whole thing pitches, rolling around as he goes up. Five feet.  Ten feet.  Fifteen feet up.  The sway gets wilder as he goes. 
At twenty feet, with twenty more to go to reach Nell, he stops.  The stairs buck, sway out dizzily.  And then to his dismay, he realizes he's on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase. 
MARROW (cont'd) Damn it. 
He straddles the rail to climb over to the other half. 
LUKE Don't! 
The sudden shift is too much for the old stairs.  The support rods CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where Marrow is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports. 
Luke shoves Theo aside, and the bottom half of the stairs spirals out in a massive, deafening COLLAPSE.  Marrow's cellular phone falls out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor. 
The top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling. Nell grips the railing at the top. 
Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below. He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it.  It takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died.  A moment of paralysis.  This is no longer an experiment.  No longer fun and games. 
MARROW Nell?  Are you up there? 
There she is.  Marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky stairs.  Luke and Theo watch from below, tense. 
Then he's there.  Nell stands a mere arm's length from him on the other side of the railing. 
MARROW (cont'd) Come on, Nell.  You have to climb over and step back on the stairs. 
Nell barely seems to hear him.  Instead she looks at the DEFORMING SUPPORT RODS around her.  We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN, calling to her. 
MARROW (cont'd) Nell!  Now! 
Theo, on the ground, calls up to Nell. 
THEO Nell, go with him!  Just go with him. 
Nell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing. She hangs there.  She looks down at the tangled steel below... 
NELL The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me. 
MARROW Nell.  You will come here now. 
Nell looks UP at him, hazy. 
And THEN BEHIND MARROW: the shifting clouds, the moon, the vines... and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark hideous face and in front of it a hand, and the hand is rushing forward to PUSH MARROW OFF THE STEPS. 
After we scream, NELL SCREAMS. 
NELL NO! 
And as Marrow falls forward, pushed by the force behind him, Nell grabs him... he is caught on the rail... As she has reached out to him, now she has fallen into thin air, and she falls towards Marrow, and they hold each other.  She has a hand... then a foot... she slips... she holds on again... and reaches the staircase.  She grabs on. 
A moment's peace... and then a new disaster: with a metallic POP POP POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic shattering of sound. 
Marrow looks behind him, to whatever it was that Nell saw over his shoulder.  He looks back at her.  Her eyes are closed, she won't open them. 
MARROW We're going down the stairs, Nell, I'm taking you down the stairs. 
He leads her go down the stairs. 
INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Marrow and Theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching Luke finish taping a trash bag over Nell's broken window.  Nell lies in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  Luke finishes, comes over.  Marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted. 
THEO She needs help. 
MARROW I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal. 
LUKE You used the wrong test. 
THEO (indignant) Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices. 
Marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.  Theo reads the feelings on his face. 
LUKE You're not telling us something. 
MARROW Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.

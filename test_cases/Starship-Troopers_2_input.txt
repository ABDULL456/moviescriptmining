104	EXT	KLENDATHU - HIGH ATMOSPERE - NIGHT - THE CAPSULES 
burn when they hit atmosphere, outer skin tearing away in big silver sheets. 
105	INT	CAPSULE - NIGHT - JOHNNY 
takes in ENTRY DATA from the heads up display. 
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in twenty-fivr seconds ...LZ has been identified ...beacon is in place... 
106	INT	RODGER YOUNG - COMMAND AND CONTROL - CARMEN 
watches nervously as deadly bursts of bug plasma fill the heavens around the battle group. Below, the surface of Klendathu fairly bistles with outgoing defensive fire. 
DELADIER This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...! 
ZANDER That's it, we're empty ma'am ! 
Out the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn. 
DELADIER Someone made a big goddam mistake ! Get us out of here, Number 1 ! 
Carmen dodges past burning ships, avoids collision with Dauntless, and then KA-WHAM !	they're hit. Carmen flies out of her station and into CAMERA hard. 
107	EXT	KLENDATHU - CLOUD LAYER - NIGHT - THE SECOND SKIN 
tears away. Johnny is sitting on air. 
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in fifteen seconds... deploying chute now... 
The chute pops. Across the sky, lit by outgoing bug plasma, he can see hundreds of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer. It's quiet in the clouds, then: 
108	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - FROM THE AIR - JOHNNY 
looks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield. Plasma blasts exploode into the sky. THOUSANDS OF BUGS boil out of the ground to defend against the invader. 
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.) ...surface in five... four ... three... 
Johnny burns his chute off, drops the last hundred feet and lands on the bounce. 
109	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY'S POV - THE FLASH PULSE of bug batteries, screaming voices on the com, concussions shaking the ground. None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT. Lieutenant Willy shouts. 
LIEUTENANT WILLY Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA ! 
A HOPPER (an airborne Arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and "pop out" wings for gliding) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut. 
ACE KILL IT ! 
Johnny and Ace open fire, backing away. Pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts gushing. 
JOHNNY Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? 
ACE I didn't see him ! 
Now comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications, and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS. 
KITTEN SMITH Here they come...! 
DIZZY Ace, what're we doing ? 
ACE I uh... uh... 
Dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects. 
SHUJUMI You want some ? Here's some ! C'MON ! 
JOHNNY Don't waste your ammon on the workers ! 
Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs. 
SHUJUMI AAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
He fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off. 
KATRINA Let's get out of here ! 
Now the ground opens behind her and a huge (6 meters) TANKER BUG lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes. 
DIZZY Look out ! 
The tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out from under her. 
KATRINA AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Warriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him. 
JOHNNY C'mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out of here !

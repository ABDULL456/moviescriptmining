[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward] 
Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]:  Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya. 
[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard] 
Mushu:  Now where are you going? 
Mulan [calling over her shoulder]:  To find someone who will believe me.  [Mulan runs into the palace yard] 
[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent] 
Emperor:  My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors. 
[The crowd cheers] 
[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd] 
Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]:  Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's touch and moves away] [agitated]  But the Huns are here!  [Mulan walks up to Man #2]  Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks away from Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard]  No one will listen! 
Mushu:  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something? 
Mulan [irritatedly]:  Mushu! 
Mushu:  Hey, you're a girl again, remember? 
[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor] 
Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]:  Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu. 
Emperor:  I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud. 
[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts] 
Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]:  No.

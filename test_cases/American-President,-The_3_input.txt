A.J. Sydney, come on in. You look beautiful. 
SYDNEY Thank you. I have no idea what I'm doing here. 
A.J. I promise you there's no hidden agenda. 
SHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY. 
SHEPHERD Sydney. Andrew Shepherd. We spoke on the phone. 
SYDNEY Yes, sir. I remember. 
ESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them. 
A.J. You know my wife, Esther. 
SYDNEY Sure. It's nice to see you again. 
ESTHER (affectionately) Sydney, the President told me about how you two met. I think it's priceless. 
SYDNEY I don't know what happened. One minute I was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader. The next minute I had a date. 
ESTHER Men like being insulted by women. It makes them feel loved. Don't ask me why. 
A.J. Sydney, when you meet the French President, don't make him feel too loved, all right? We just signed a new trade agreement. 
SYDNEY Got it. 
The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach. 
SHEPHERD (to D'Astier) Mr. President, would allow me to introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney, this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier and his wife Monique Danielle D'Astier of France. 
SYDNEY An honor to meet you both. 
JANIE Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt. The receiving line is in place. 
SHEPHERD Sydney, it sounds like our table's ready. 
SHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence, leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and MDME. D'ASTIER. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters the East Room. 
The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy. 
SHEPHERD Once we hit the bottom of the stairs, I gotta do a thing. You'll be escorted... 
SYDNEY They took me through it. 
After a slight pause-- 
SYDNEY (continuing) Do you do this often, sir? 
SHEPHERD (beat) This is, actually, only our second State Dinner. The first was for the Emperor of Japan, who died shortly after that, so we stopped having them for a while, just in case. 
SYDNEY I meant do you go out on...do you-- often--do you-- 
SHEPHERD Do I date a lot? 
SYDNEY Well, yeah. 
SHEPHERD No. How 'bout you? 
SYDNEY Me? Lately, I seem to be going out on a lot of first dates. 
SHEPHERD Then you're experienced at this. 
SYDNEY Oh yeah, you can ask me anything. 
SHEPHERD How are we doing so far? 
SYDNEY It's hard to say at this point. So far it's just your typical first date stuff. 
And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East Room-- 
--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes. 
SHEPHERD Damn. And I wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys. 
A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces-- 
VOICE (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. 
And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision -- 
SHEPHERD By the way, nice shoes. 
--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF. 
The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud. 
The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite swept up. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. EAST ROOM - NIGHT 
The room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the SECRET SERVICE strategically positioned.

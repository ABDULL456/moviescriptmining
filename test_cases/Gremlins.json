Any- thing. \nRAND PELTZER walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old. Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL, WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite smile. \nRAND Hi. I'm from out of town... on business from the U.S. The woman nods and smiles. \nAN ORIENTAL MAN passes by. He is very old. Deep wrinkles. Long white hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop. \nRAND (explaining to Oriental woman) I'm looking for a present... for my son. The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head. \nRAND He's not really involved in sports... The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony \"Walkman\". Rand again shakes his head., \nRAND No. I want something unusual... something he can't get at home... something different.. \nA HAND reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns. The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's eyes. \nORIENTAL MAN I can help you. He leads Rand away from the booth. \nORIENTAL MAN I offer something very different. Very unusual. Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway. \nORIENTAL MAN Follow me. He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand pauses, skeptical. \nORIENTAL MAN Come. Take a look. It will cost you nothing. (a beat) You won't be disappointed. The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows. \nINSIDE Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs. At the top, they enter a room. \nINT. ROOM \nDark. No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard boxes and wooden crates. Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here. The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room. The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED GIGGLE echoes from inside the box. \nRand is very puzzled. The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens the box. A TINY CREATURE is inside'. The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed. A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small, square teeth. The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle. Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney character. The Oriental claps his hands. The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder. The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the creature. The Oriental claps his hands again. The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand with those cute green eyes'. \nRAND (to the Oriental) What is it? \nORIENTAL MAN It is called ' Mogwai ' . (a beat) A very rare and intelligent animal. I found it in the fields near my home It will obey all orders. It learns fast. The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands. \nORIENTAL MAN (Chinese,; English \nSUBTITLES) \n--Mogwai leaps to the ground. It scurries across the floor, to a wooden crate. Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate. It tears off a chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man.. He takes the fish. Mogwai hops back into the box. Rand shakes his head. Amazed by the animal. he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs own his chin. He smiles at Rand. \nORIENTAL MAN And if you are ever in need of a song... He claps his hands to the creature. \nORIENTAL MAN. (Chinese; English \nBILLY PELTZER a bank teller, writes out a receipt for a customer. \nBilly is 26 years old.

DEAGLE My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This young teller is being very rude! I demand that you fire him! \nRoland looks at Billy. Billy rolls his eyes. Roland smiles. \nROLAND \n(COMFORTING) Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this isn't that serious. I'm sure an apology would fix things right up. Wouldn't it? The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy. \nROLAND Apologize to the woman, Billy. Billy leans to Roland. \nBILLY \n(SHRUGS) Beats T.V. \nGARY- (gives Billy the \nBOOK) I'll take 'Monday Night Football' over this crap any day. (takes Tracy's arm) C'mon. Let's go. Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away. Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side. He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary. Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas- cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny section.. He laughs. \nGary notices Billy. Gary nudges the others. \nGARY What a nut. Laughin' to himself. That's the kind of guy who'll shoot a president. \nTRACY \n(DEFENSIVE) I don't see anything wrong with him. I'm sure he's very intelligent. \nGARY Yeah, and those are the guys who always crack. The real smart guys. 6ti (pause) He's gotta be a psycho. 26 years old, still lives with his parents. Doesn't have a girlfriend. He's always alone. Real weirdo. The others agree. Tracy doesn't. She likes Billy. Billy continues to read, totally caught up in his book.

The roads are icy. \nCAR RADIO (V.0.) .And the snow keeps coming, folks. Looks like we're gonna have a White Christmas. Another three inches is expected tonight... Billy looks out of his side window and sees \nPETE FOUNTANE walking home from school. Pete is 16 years old. A chunky, pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange down jacket, Pete resembles a tiny snowman. Suddenly, Pete.slips on the ice. Bam. Right on his ass. His school books scatter over the ground. \nBilly stops the car. He gets out and hurries to Pete. \nBILLY Pete...You okay? Pete nods. Billy helps him up. Pete brushes himself off. Billy is amused by the boy. \nBILLY You want a ride home? \nPETE Thanks.

You can borrow it. Pete takes the book. \nPETE Hey, Billy...You know so much about Vikings and stuff...You should write one of these stories yourself. \nLYNN I think he's just darling. Mogwai. Rand holds the creature out to Billy. \nRAND Hold him. \nBILLY (inching back) Maybe later. \nRAND C'mon. He won't bite. Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son. \nRAND He likes you. Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands. \nLYNN You two look so cute together. I have to take a picture. Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a Kodak Instamatic. Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy hates it. \nRAND - I want you to take good care of him. Lynn focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai. \nLYNN Okay smile. Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek. Lynn snaps the picture. Flash! Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's cheek. \nBILLY Little bastard. Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature, comforting it \nSettle down, Billy-There's no reason to get upset. The little fellow's scared. He hates bright light.. Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on his face. He looks -at t em. There's blood on his\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd4ingertips. Billy looks at Mogwai. The creature looks at Billy. It giggles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BILLY'S ROOM - LATER \nBilly sits at his desk, working on his novel. His typing is fast, intense. A small desk lamp lights.his working area. Mogwai watches Billy. from the darkness of the book shelves. Above Billy., The creature begins to sing. Billy tries to ignore Mogwai's singing. No good. It gets on his nerves. Billy slams his hand on the desk top. He glares at the creature. \nBILLY Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to Billy's arm. He jumps back. \nBILLY Get off of me. Mogwai just looks at him. \nBILLY Get.off`my desk. Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature. \nBILLY Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work. Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped. \nBILLY (angry, to Mogwai) You stupid little... Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery. Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and picks up the.creature. \nBILLY \n(TENDER) I'm sorry.. .just try to be more careful. Billy holds Mogwai to his chest. He's petting it, com- forting it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BILLYS ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nBilly sleeps. The room is totally dark.

Billy holds the tray of brownies to him. \nBILLY Want some? \nPETE _ I'm s'posed to be on a diet... He grabs a brownie. He notices Mogwai's case. \nPETE What's in there? Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback. \nPETE What is it? \nBILLY A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai. \nPETE It's neat. Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie and starts to eat. \nPETE Hey, Billy.. .You think I might be able to borrow it? Just for a night? \nBILLY I dunno, Pete... \nPETE C'mon...My Mom will never know. I'll hide it under my bed. Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily knocks over the water bottle. A few drops of water splash Mogwai. The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched scream. Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared. Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with water begin to bubble... .expand...' Billy can't believe his eyes. Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more, getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode. Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated. The spots burst. \nFOUR NEW CREATURES popout. Clones of Mogwai. The spots on Mogwai's body bond together and disappear, as if they were never there. There are now five identical creatures on the desktop. Billy and Pete share a shocked glance. Billy grabs the water bottle. He has to be certain that he wasn't halucinating. He splashes a little more water on one of the new creatures. The process begins again. The creature's body,contorts. A few lumps form. The lumps expand until...they burst. \nREV. 4/30/82 29 \nLI \nTHREE MORE CREATURES ARE BORN. Billy tries to make sense out of it all. EIGHT CREATURES stand on.the desk top, examining their new world. Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk on one of the crealtures. Nothing happens. \nBILLY They must only multiply with plain tap water. \nPETE \n(AMAZED) \nM Wow..\u00e2\u0080\u00a2.this\u00e2\u0080\u00a2is better than \"Twilight Zone ( ) Pete looks at Billy. \nPETE Now can I have one? \nBILLY (still dazed) Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group. \nPETE \n(SCARED) Maybe I won't take one. The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the brownies to pieces, devouring them. They're giggling. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nRand sits in a chair, opposite Billy. The 8 creatures climb all over Rand. Playfully tugging at his hair and \nROY (friendly smile) Well, sure... (shakes Billy's hand) .I'm Roy Hanson.

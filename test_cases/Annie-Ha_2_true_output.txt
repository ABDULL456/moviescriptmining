The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people milling about. 
1ST MAN Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings. 
2ND MAN M'mm. 
Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy and Annie to show them the rest of the house. 
TONY This is a great house, really.  Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.  Then you know who lived here? 
ALVY Trigger. 
Annie and the girl in white laugh. 
TONY Charlie Chaplin. 
ALVY Hey. 
TONY Right before his un-American thing. 
They stop in a den-like screening room.  A man is slouched back on one of the comfortable sofas that fill the room.  It is much quieter in here; a contrast to the noise and crowd downstairs. 
ALVY Yeah, this place is great. 
ANNIE Yeah. 
TONY Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers. 
ALVY Yeah, I love it there. 
ANNIE (Laughing) Yeah. 
TONY Well, I used to live there.  I used to live there for years.  You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now. 
ANNIE Yeah. 
ALVY I'm into garbage.  It's my thing. 
ANNIE Boy, this is really a nice screening room.  It's really a nice room. 
TONY Oh, and there's another thing about New York.  See ... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line. 
ANNIE Yeah. 
TONY It could be freezing, it could be raining. 
ANNIE Yeah. 
TONY And here, you just- 
GIRL IN WHITE We saw "Grand Illusion" here last night. 
ALVY AND ANNIE (In unison) Oh, yeah? 
MAN ON THE SOFA (Looking over his shoulder at the group) That's a great film if you're high. (The group laughs, looking down at the man on the sofa. He looks up at them, smiling, a joint in his hand, and offers them a cigarette) Hey, you. 
TONY (Shaking his head no) Come and see our bedroom.  We did a fantastic lighting job.  Okay? 
ANNIE Oh, good.  Okay. 
ALVY I'm cool. 
Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following. 
ANNIE (Taking Alvy's arm) It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day. 
ALVY Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while. 
ANNIE Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful? 
ALVY Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side.  But it's... 
They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway. 
MAN ON THE PHONE Yeah, yeah.  I forgot my mantra. 
As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear.  People are looser now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate corners, some couples are dancing.  Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the huge Christmas tree.  A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves. He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of the room dancing. 
The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then: 
CUT TO: 
AIRPLANE.  INT. AIRPLANE 
Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads.  Both are preoccupied, thinking their own thoughts.

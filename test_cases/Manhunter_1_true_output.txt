DOLLARHYDE I'LL take you. 
BEBA (standing close) No, thanks. I manage very well. (beat) I'LL order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow. 
Reba walks our of the dark room. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN, TRAVELLING - OUT OF WINDOW - NIGHT 
We pass Reba on the sidewalk. She is walking briskly with her cane and tapping in front of her. She's very confident. 
DOLLARHYDE Ride with me. 
REBA Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time. 
DOLLARHYDE Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to. 
Reba stops. She likes Dollarhyde's directness. He gets our and comes around to help her in. He starts to take her arm. 
REBA It's better if I rake your arm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - DOOR - NIGHT 
We hear footsteps come up. Reba's key is in the lock. As the door is starting to open: 
REBA Come on in. (beat) How about a gin and tonic? 
DOLLARHYDE Tonic will be fine. 
REBA In the kitchen. 
INT. REBA'S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - REBA 
enters. She momentarily forgets, retraces her steps and turns on the light. She opens the refrigerator. During the next pieces of dialogue, we will see Reba being ex- tremely competent making the drinks. 
DOLLARHYDE How did you come to Gateway? 
BEBA They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract. 
Reba takes a l0-inch chef's knife and deftly cuts the lime, guiding it with her thumb. 
DOLLARHYDE You worked out well. 
REBA You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children... 
DOLLARHYDE 
reacts to "speech therapy." Characteristically -- his attention goes to: 
KNIFE 
in Reba's hand. Its extremely sharp cutting edge glints in the light. Another slice of lime falls. 
REBA I'll probably go back to it someday. 
DOLLARHYDE Uh-huh. 
Silence. Reba hands him his drink. 
REBA. If you don't want to talk. okay. Bur I hope you will... because I like what you say. 
Dollarhyde is stunned, at both her perception and frankness. 
REBA May I touch your face? (as Dollarhyde reacts) I want to know if you're smiling or frowning. I want to know if I should just shut up or not... 
There's a smile on her face. Now her hand moves up towards Dollarhyde's mouth with the Z-plast scars where his harelip and cleft palate were fixed. 
REBA' S HAND 
Dollarhyde's fist grabs it. 
DOLLARHYDE 
turns her hand in the light. 
DOLLARHYDE Take my word for it that I'm... smiling . 
There is no smile on Dollarhyde's face. 
RZBA If I've offended you, I didn't mean to. 
He still has her hand in his grasp. 
DOLLARHYDE I have to go now. 
He lets go of her hand.

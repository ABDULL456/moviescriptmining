He adores her more than ever, and fears losing her even more. 
CRIS Your students are very lucky. 
She puts her hand on his. 
LIZ Now I've got to grade papers. 
Ext. Church - DAY 
Liz and Cris file by the PASTOR after the service and mill about on the lawn with the other congregants. Kids release pent up energy in the adjacent park. 
Randy approaches Cris. 
Randy A religious fella, are you? Ready to turn the other jaw? 
Cris offers his profile for hitting. 
CRIS But then you have to sign the divorce papers. 
LiZ Randy, don't you dare. 
She drags Cris towards a YOUNG COUPLE WITH KIDS. 
Liz Paul, Janice. Have you met Cris? 
RANDY 
approaches RICK, a young LOCAL POLICEMAN who's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. 
Randy There's something weird about that jerk. Have you checked him out? 
Policeman RICK I'm not dragging the Law into your romantic squabbles, Randy. 
Randy C'mon, Rick, help me out here. 
Ext. church - DAY 
Paul and Janice are chatting with Cris and Liz. 
Paul Cris, are you free on Tuesday? Cause I'd like you to be my guest at the Rotary luncheon. 
Janice I'm the first female member. 
Cris grows distracted. Out the corner of his eye, he sees a SPORTS CAR gunning it down the street, passing a SUNDAY DRIVER to beat a red light. At that moment, a kid misses a catch and a BASEBALL rolls into a street, where a twenty-ish WOMAN JOGGER runs over to get it, just as the sports car passes the Sunday driver, sees the jogger, and skids, forcing A BUS to swerve and plow into a GROUP OF PEOPLE standing at the corner. 
SNAPBACK TO: 
A FEW SECONDS EARLIER 
Paul Cris, are you free on Tuesday? Cause I'd like you to be my guest at the Rotary luncheon. 
Janice I'm the first female member. 
Cris is spaced out. 
LIZ Cris. 
Ignoring them, Cris turns toward the street where he saw the accident take place. He sees kids, but they're jumping rope. Wrong group. He scans around and finds the kids who are playing softball. Someone misses a catch. The ball rolls toward the street. The sports car is now coming fast. The woman jogger sees the errant ball and runs to fetch it. 
CrIS Miss! Lady! Don't! 
She's wearing earbuds and can't hear him. He's too far away to grab her. He's closer to the approaching sports car. Cris picks up a rock, prepares to throw, hesitates a beat, squints.... 
He throws. Misses. Snapback. Throws. Misses. Snapback. Again. Again. Scores a hit. Snapback. Opens his eyes and hurls the stone. 
Liz and the bystanders watch, appalled, as the rock SHATTERS the driver side window of the sportscar, which instead of skidding, screeches to a halt. The bus drives by without incident, injuring no one. 
The Driver of the sportscar bursts from his car and furiously charges Cris. 
CrIS I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for the damages. 
The Driver curses Cris and tries to grab and hit him. But Cris deftly deflects the blows so that they seem harmless. 
CRIS I said I'll pay. 
Realizing he can't land a punch, the Driver changes tack. 
DRIVER You're damn right you'll pay! I wanna talk to the cops. 
CRIS No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash? 
He pulls out his wallet. 
CriS Two thousand? That should cover it. 
DRIVER Make it three. 
CRIS Okay, three. 
He digs in his pocket and pulls out the stack of hundreds. 
ON RANDY and POLICEMAN RICK 
Who have seen the whole incident. 
POLICEMAN riCK I'll run him through the computer. 
ext. Park - a minute later 
Away from the crowd. Liz, concerned and alienated, walks a step to the side of Cris. 
criS People shouldn't drive that fast around kids. They shouldn't get away with it. 
LIZ So you throw rocks at them? 
CRIS What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die? 
Liz is torn.

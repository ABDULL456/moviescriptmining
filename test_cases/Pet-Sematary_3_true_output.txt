EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD 
They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in. 
RACHEL How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children! 
JUD Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah! 
LOUIS I think it's rather extraordinary. 
RACHEL Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. 
She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously. 
JUD Well...they have to learn about death somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed? The little ones? 
RACHEL (coldly) Why? 
JUD Well...well, because-- 
ELLIE (voice) Mommy! Daddy! Look at me! 
EXT.  ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL 
She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches nimbly to the next one up. 
EXT.  THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH 
JUD (alarmed) No, honey! You don't want to go climbing on that! Come on down! 
He hurries in. 
EXT.  ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL 
She looks back at JUD. 
ELLIE It's okay, Mr. Crandall-- 
EXT.  ELLIE'S FOOT, CU 
The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down suddenly. 
EXT.  ELLIE AND JUD 
She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up. 
LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back. 
LOUIS Have you got a death-wish, Ellen? 
ELLIE Well, I thought it was safe-- 
JUD Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite. 
ELLIE Bite? 
JUD Ayuh. 
EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH 
Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to come in. 
RACHEL (calls) Is she all right, Louis? 
EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE 
LOUIS (calls back) Fine! Come and see! 
EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH 
RACHEL (calling) I think I'll sit this one out, doc. 
EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL 
ELLIE I want to look around, daddy-- may I? 
LOUIS For a little while. 
JUD looks toward: 
EXT.  RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.) 
RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS looks away. 
ELLIE (voice) Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie! 
EXT.  ELLIE 
She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at SMUCKY'S. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the tombstones. 
LOUIS I can hardly read these. 
JUD Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle. (Points) Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there... (points) the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure. (calling) Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute! 
EXT.  ELLEN 
She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the adults. 
JUD I see you're quite a reader for such a little girl. Can you read that? 
He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see. 
EXT.  ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER 
It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the words laboriously, tracing them with her finger. 
ELLEN "Spot a good fellow we love you boy." (Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..." Gee, I can't read the rest. 
EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS 
JUD Last name's Crandall, little missy. 
LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.

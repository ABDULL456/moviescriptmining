He picks up a camera from a table in the corner. He looks at the self-help audio book box. 
JOHN A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours? 
CHARLOTTE Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me. 
JOHN You don't have to be embarrassed. 
CHARLOTTE I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it. 
JOHN It's ok if you are. 
He kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute pet, and then continues getting his stuff together. 
John sets two bottles of Cristal on the bed next to her, not really seeing her. 
JOHN Oh, the record company sent these... 
CHARLOTTE Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some. 
JOHN I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne. 
As he unplugs his cell phone from the wall. 
JOHN Are you sure you want to stay? 
CHARLOTTE Are you sure you have to go? 
He looks at her - like don't make it harder. 
CHARLOTTE Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys. 
JOHN Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you. 
They kiss. 
CHARLOTTE I love you. 
He tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, tickling her in a burst of affection. She laughs, her arms around his neck. 
CHARLOTTE I miss you. 
JOHN It'll just be a few days. 
He kisses her and is off. 
Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of champagne.

Water splashes as Charlotte dives into the pool (in a one- piece bathing suit) as the sun goes down.

I really won't do it. \nCALVIN What in hell has happened? \nUpstairs, Conrad's bedroom door slams. \nCALVIN (cont'd) Somebody better go up there. \nBETH Ah! Oh, god, that's the pattern, isn't it? He walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him. \nCALVIN I am not going to apologize... \nBETH Yes of course you are! You always do!

His voice is muffled by his head between his arms. \nCALVIN I want to talk to you. \nCONRAD I need to sleep. \nCALVIN In a minute... \nCONRAD I didn't mean it. I didn't mean any of it. I am sorry. Please don't be mad. \nCALVIN I'm not mad ! I'm just trying to figure out what happened down there. \nCONRAD I don't know what happened! I am sorry about it all. I am sorry about the whole thing.

It doesn't change the way she looks at me. \nCALVIN She was upset, Conrad. Your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team. I don't understand it myself. \nCONRAD I don't mean just now. Don't you see? I don't mean just today. \nCALVIN What then? Explain it to me. \nCONRAD Ha! I can't! Everything is German pudding with you , dad.

Can't you see that? \nCALVIN Your mother doesn't hate you, Conrad? \nCONRAD All right, all right. You're right. She doesn't. Please leave me alone, now. \nSilence.

Okay? \nCONRAD You're the doctor. \nDR BERGER Don't take refuge in one-liners like \"You're the doctor\". Okay? Because that pisses me off. \nCONRAD Okay. Okay. \nDR BERGER So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy. \nCONRAD Yeah, but I don't blame her. I mean, she's got... She's got her reasons. It's impossible after all the shit I've pulled! \nDR BERGER What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here. Now, what shit? \nConrad sighs. \nCALVIN OK. \nFRIEND I'll see you, Cal. \nCALVIN See you later. \nNow Calvin is running through the park alone.

Dr. BERGER'S OFFICE \u00ad EVENING \nCalvin laughs nervously, all smiles. \nDR BERGER (OS) That's good. \nCALVIN In the car, I was thinking: \"be clear.\". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry. \nDR BERGER Okay. \nCALVIN I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody. \nDR BERGER Neither do I. \nCalvin laughs. \nCALVIN I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here. \nDR BERGER Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that? \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                   77 \nCALVIN I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an \"A\" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems. \nDR BERGER But you still feel responsible? \nCALVIN Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck! \nDR BERGER You think of yourself as a lucky man, then? \nCALVIN No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the \"accident\". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it. \nDR BERGER That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney. \nCALVIN Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching. \nDR BERGER What would you want to do about that? \nCALVIN Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                 77 CALVIN (cont'd) I feel like I'm sitting on a fence, and I don't like it. \nDR BERGER And you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence? \nCALVIN Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him. \nDR BERGER For what? \nCALVIN Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh... \nDR BERGER Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck? \nCALVIN Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it? \nDR BERGER And you? \nCALVIN Me?    I   loved Buck. \nDR BERGER What I mean is, your wife's affection. \nCALVIN For me you mean? \nDR BERGER Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                  77 \nCALVIN Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it? \nDR BERGER Mm-hmm.   Very private. \nBETH What? \nSALESWOMAN May I show you this dress in your size? \nBETH Oh... No, no. No. Thanks. \n81   INT.

Beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought. \nBETH We've got Bennett's, and Grant's and Foley's. Ha, Conrad should get something for my mother and father. He's not supposed to get something for his doctor, is he? \nCALVIN I don't think so. I think we should go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger. \nBeth laughs. \nBETH What? \nCALVIN I think we could all go and see him together. \nBETH Why? \nCALVIN He thinks it's a good idea. \n(CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                 81 \nBETH Ho... He thinks it's a good idea? What does he know about me, about this family? I've never even met him. \nCALVIN Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open. \nBETH About what? What are we gonna talk about? Don't try to change me, Calvin. I don't want anymore changes in my life. For God's sake, hasn't enough happened? Let's just hold on to what we've got! \nCALVIN Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise. \nBETH I don't want any surprises. I know I'm not perfect. And if I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry. \nCALVIN I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point. \nBETH I don't want to see any doctors or counselors. I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong... \nWAITRESS (interrupting) Are you folks ready to order? \nCALVIN Huh, no... Could you give me a couple of minutes, please? \nWAITRESS Sure. \n(CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                  81 \nBETH ...running to experts every time something goes wrong. \nSilence \nBETH (cont'd) I know you mean well.

We can spend some time in Houston with my brother and Audrey. You know, play a little golf. Relax. \nCalvin seems doubtfull. Beth goes softly. \nBETH (cont'd) I have already talked to Mother about it, and Conrad can stay with them. Please don't worry about it. Please, for his sake, don't indulge him. We need time together. Okay? \nCALVIN Okay.   Okay. \nBeth takes his hand but it seems almost like a handshake. \nBETH I love you. \nCALVIN I love you, too. \nBeth stares at him. \nBETH Let's just give things time.

How it used to get on top of your car, and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway. \nBETH Oh. Yeah, I remember. I remember how scared I used to get... That whosssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap, flap!... Every time I started the car. \nCONRAD Yeah. That was the closest we ever came to having a pet. You remember Buck asked you, he tried to talk you into... getting a dog. Do you remember that? He said. \"How about it, if it's the size of a little football?\" \nBETH You know. Uh... That animal next door, that Pepper or Pippin, whatever its name is... \nCONRAD Pippin. Pippin. Pippin! \nBETH He's not a very friendly dog...    I... I don't care what Mr. McGreary says. \nCONRAD                              BETH - What he really wanted was a      - Everytime time that dog retriever.

Arf! \nBeth stops in her tracks, startled, but doesn't show it. \nBETH Put that on if you're gonna stay out here, okay? \nConrad stays alone a while and stares. Then goes inside. \n54   INT. JARRETT'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM \u00ad DAY                    54 \nConrad enters hesitantly, back from garden. Beth is busy dressing up the table. \nCONRAD Can I help? \nBETH Help what? Oh, you mean with this? No. \nCONRAD I will. \nBETH (casually) No, I tell you what you can do though. You can go upstairs to that room of yours and clean out the closet. \nCONRAD Mom... \nBETH Okay? Because it really is a mess. \nThey stand there, facing each other, uptight. The telephone rings. Beth goes over to it, picks it up, seems suddenly delighted. \nBETH (cont'd) Hello. /.../ Oh, hi! /.../ Yeah, , no, I didn't get there. I was swamped with work. How did it go? /.../ No, no, I'm not doing anything, just getting ready for dinner. Uh-huh. \n", "test3_input": "BETH What? \nCALVIN What you started. \nBETH What I started? \nCALVIN What you started. \nBETH Ha! There's no point discussing it. \nCALVIN I think there is a point. \nBETH He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away. \nCALVIN He isn't the problem. \nBETH Isn't he? \nCALVIN No, he isn't. Let's talk about what's really bothering you. \nBETH No, no. Let's talk about what's bothering you. Cos' that's what you want, isn't it? \nCALVIN Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me? \n(CONTINUED) \n151   CONTINUED:                                                 151 \nBETH It's not what you've done, it's what you think I've done. You blame me for the whole thing. \nCALVIN Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you? \nBETH No! I can't! And neither can you, and neither can anybody else! Only maybe I'm just a little more honest about it! \nCALVIN Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while! \nBETH I don't know what he expects from me. I never have known. \nCALVIN Well, I'll tell you what he expects! \nBETH What? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can't do it! I cannot respond when someone says: \"Here, I just did this great thing. Love me.\". I can't! \nCALVIN All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it. \nBETH Hate him? My God! How could I hate him? Mothers don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you? \nCALVIN I just try to keep this family together... \n(CONTINUED) \n151   CONTINUED:                                                   151 \nBETH (she shouts) I don't know what everyone wants from me anymore! \nAUDREY Beth, nobody wants anything from you. \nWARD Beth, listen. We all just want... Cal, Con, everybody, we just want you to be happy. \nBETH Happy? \nWARD Yes. \nBETH Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! And then you come to me and tell me how to be happy! \nShe leaves. Calvin follows. Ward and his wife just stand there. \n152   INT.

She sighs, closes her eyes; Calvin turns away from the window, looks at Beth and remembers... \nWhen they were happily dancing...    [ to and fro twice] \nCalvin in his plane seat, reflects. \n153   INT. LIVING ROOM \u00ad NIGHT                                     153 \nBeth checks a pile of mail.

It was kind of a rough week. \nCALVIN I hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you? \nCONRAD No. She was fine. I'm glad you're back. \nConrad gives his mother a hug, but she is like made of stone. Calvin sees it. \nCONRAD (cont'd) Good night. \nBeth remains transfixed as if she didn't know what it was all about. Calvin sees it. \n154   INT. BEDROOM \u00ad NIGHT                                       154 \nBeth is not sleeping, she looks up, sees her husband wrinkled pillow, but he is not in bed. She looks at the time, gets up, puts on a robe. \n155   INT. STAIRS \u00ad NIGHT                                        155 \nBeth goes downstairs, tying up her robe.

What did you say? \nCalvin produces a very deep sigh. \nBETH (cont'd) Tell me. \nCalvin looks up at her with a sad expression. \nCALVIN You are beautiful. And you are unpredictable. But you're so cautious. You're determined, Beth. But you know something? You're not strong. And I don't know if you're really giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about. \nCALVIN (cont'd) Tell me something. Do you love me? Do you really love me? \nBETH I feel the way I've always felt about you. \nCalvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just sad. \nCALVIN We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. But you can't handle mess. You need everything neat and ...easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't love anybody. It was so much Buck. And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I don't understand that. I just don't know. \nCalvin sighs. \nCALVIN (cont'd) Maybe it wasn't even Buck. Maybe it was just you. Maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried.

So I was crying. \nCalvin is overcome by sadness \nCALVIN (cont'd) 't know if I love you anymore. And I don't know what I am going to do without that. \nBeth does not know what to say or do.

A sudden burst of emotion overcomes her, she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion, then restrains it. \n158   INT. CONRAD'S BEDROOM \u00ad DAWN                               158 \nIn his bed Conrad is not sleeping. He hears the door of the house close, then someone walking outside on the gravel. He gets up, go look out of the window. Ouside, a taxi leaves. He goes downstairs. \n159   INT. STAIRS \u00ad DAWN                                         159 \nConrad goes downstairs, curious.

Conrad puts on his coat over his pyjamas, and joins him. \nCONRAD Dad? \nCALVIN The yard looks smaller without leaves. \nCONRAD Dad? What happened? \nCALVIN Your mother's going away for a while. \nCONRAD Where?   Why? \n(CONTINUED) \n160   CONTINUED:                                                 160 \nCALVIN Back to Houston.

It's nobody's fault! Things happen in this world, people don't always have answers for them, you know. \nCalvin sits down. \nCALVIN (cont'd) I don't know why I'm yelling at you for... \nCONRAD No, that's right! You're right! You ought to do that more often. \nCALVIN Oh, yeah? \nCONRAD Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little, you know. Get after me. The way you used to for him. \nCALVIN Oh, he needed it.

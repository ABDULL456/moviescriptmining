I dunno.It just didn't work for me, I guess. He just kept telling me all the things I already knew, and , uh... finally, I decided... the only one who can help me is myself. At least, that's what my dad says. I don't mean it's not right for you, Conrad. I mean I think that if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing. \nCONRAD Well, ya, I don't know how long I'll keep it up. I sorta got shoved into it. \nPause \nKAREN Your hair grew in. \nCONRAD Oh, yes. That was such a dumb thing to do. \nKAREN I like it. \nCONRAD You do? \nKAREN Yeah! \nCONRAD I don't know, I just...

It doesn't change the way she looks at me. \nCALVIN She was upset, Conrad. Your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team. I don't understand it myself. \nCONRAD I don't mean just now. Don't you see? I don't mean just today. \nCALVIN What then? Explain it to me. \nCONRAD Ha! I can't! Everything is German pudding with you , dad.

Okay. \nDR BERGER So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy. \nCONRAD Yeah, but I don't blame her. I mean, she's got... She's got her reasons. It's impossible after all the shit I've pulled! \nDR BERGER What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here.

Dr. BERGER'S OFFICE \u00ad EVENING \nCalvin laughs nervously, all smiles. \nDR BERGER (OS) That's good. \nCALVIN In the car, I was thinking: \"be clear.\". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry. \nDR BERGER Okay. \nCALVIN I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody. \nDR BERGER Neither do I. \nCalvin laughs. \nCALVIN I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here. \nDR BERGER Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that? \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                   77 \nCALVIN I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an \"A\" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems. \nDR BERGER But you still feel responsible? \nCALVIN Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck! \nDR BERGER You think of yourself as a lucky man, then? \nCALVIN No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the \"accident\". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it. \nDR BERGER That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney. \nCALVIN Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching. \nDR BERGER What would you want to do about that? \nCALVIN Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.

No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him. \nDR BERGER For what? \nCALVIN Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh... \nDR BERGER Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck? \nCALVIN Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it? \nDR BERGER And you? \nCALVIN Me?    I   loved Buck. \nDR BERGER What I mean is, your wife's affection. \nCALVIN For me you mean? \nDR BERGER Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                  77 \nCALVIN Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it? \nDR BERGER Mm-hmm.   Very private. \nBETH What? \nSALESWOMAN May I show you this dress in your size? \nBETH Oh... No, no. No. Thanks. \n81   INT.

Beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought. \nBETH We've got Bennett's, and Grant's and Foley's. Ha, Conrad should get something for my mother and father. He's not supposed to get something for his doctor, is he? \nCALVIN I don't think so. I think we should go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger. \nBeth laughs. \nBETH What? \nCALVIN I think we could all go and see him together. \nBETH Why? \nCALVIN He thinks it's a good idea. \n(CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                 81 \nBETH Ho... He thinks it's a good idea? What does he know about me, about this family? I've never even met him. \nCALVIN Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open. \nBETH About what? What are we gonna talk about? Don't try to change me, Calvin. I don't want anymore changes in my life. For God's sake, hasn't enough happened? Let's just hold on to what we've got! \nCALVIN Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise. \nBETH I don't want any surprises. I know I'm not perfect. And if I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry. \nCALVIN I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point. \nBETH I don't want to see any doctors or counselors. I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong... \nWAITRESS (interrupting) Are you folks ready to order? \nCALVIN Huh, no... Could you give me a couple of minutes, please? \nWAITRESS Sure. \n(CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                  81 \nBETH ...running to experts every time something goes wrong. \nSilence \nBETH (cont'd) I know you mean well.

We can spend some time in Houston with my brother and Audrey. You know, play a little golf. Relax. \nCalvin seems doubtfull. Beth goes softly. \nBETH (cont'd) I have already talked to Mother about it, and Conrad can stay with them. Please don't worry about it. Please, for his sake, don't indulge him. We need time together. Okay? \nCALVIN Okay.   Okay. \nBeth takes his hand but it seems almost like a handshake. \nBETH I love you. \nCALVIN I love you, too. \nBeth stares at him. \nBETH Let's just give things time.

What is it with you? Huh? I don't know why you want to be in this alone? You know, I miss him too. Connie, the three of us were best friends! \nCONRAD I can't help it, it hurts too much to be around you. I gotta go. \nLazenby looks at him, then opens the door and goes out. \nLAZENBY Yeah.

I laugh. \nCONRAD But they were all right. They were just up and they were having a good time, and I let them get in the way of what was happening. It was dumb. It was dumb. I've been doing lots of dumb things lately.

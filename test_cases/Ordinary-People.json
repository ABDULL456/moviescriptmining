What about him? \nCONRAD My father came into my room and he didn't know what to say. This is right after Buck died. And he came over and sat on the bed next to me, put his arm around my shoulder. We just sat there. I remember I was watching his shoe. And thinking... Cos his shoe was turned over on its side. I was thinking: \"He's so uptight, it's gonna crack off.\" \nDr Berger listens carefully. \nCONRAD (cont'd) And I knew I should have felt something. But I didn't know what to feel.

That's not the problem. Where are you? \nCALVIN What? \nRAY HANLEY I've been losing you these days. \nCALVIN Oh, I'm sorry. \nRAY HANLEY That's okay. That's okay. You off the track? \nCALVIN Huh? \nThey laugh. \nRAY HANLEY Come on. I've known you for twenty years. You think I can't tell when something's wrong? How's Connie? \nCALVIN Connie's all right. He is. He's okay. \nRAY HANLEY Look, I am sorry, it's none of my business, but I think you worry too much. You've been on the rack about him long enough. You're making it a habit. You've gotta let him go sometime. \nCALVIN I'm not on the rack about him. \nRAY HANLEY The thing about it is, in a year he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go. Maybe he'll decide to take a tour of Europe for a year and not even go to school at all.

She's gone. Got her own friends, her own life. She breezes in ...for a couple of days on vacations, but... I don't know, maybe girls are different. Or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between Nance and me. But they leave... And all that worrying doesn't amount to a hill of crap. It's just wasted energy. \nCalvin is troubled. \n58   INT. COMMUTER TRAIN \u00ad NIGHT                                  58 \nGoing home on the commuter, Calvin is thoughtful.

Dr. BERGER'S OFFICE \u00ad EVENING \nCalvin laughs nervously, all smiles. \nDR BERGER (OS) That's good. \nCALVIN In the car, I was thinking: \"be clear.\". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry. \nDR BERGER Okay. \nCALVIN I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody. \nDR BERGER Neither do I. \nCalvin laughs. \nCALVIN I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here. \nDR BERGER Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things.

You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an \"A\" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems. \nDR BERGER But you still feel responsible? \nCALVIN Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck! \nDR BERGER You think of yourself as a lucky man, then? \nCALVIN No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the \"accident\". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it. \nDR BERGER That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney. \nCALVIN Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching. \nDR BERGER What would you want to do about that? \nCALVIN Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.

No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him. \nDR BERGER For what? \nCALVIN Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh... \nDR BERGER Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck? \nCALVIN Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it? \nDR BERGER And you? \nCALVIN Me?    I   loved Buck. \nDR BERGER What I mean is, your wife's affection. \nCALVIN For me you mean? \nDR BERGER Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                  77 \nCALVIN Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it? \nDR BERGER Mm-hmm.   Very private. \n", "test3_true": "DR BERGER Okay. Why don't we? \n78   INT. JARRETT'S HOME.

And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's funeral? \nBETH Ha, ha. \nBeth retreats inside the house to the kitchen. \nCALVIN Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen! \nBETH I won't listen to that!

I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to ...tell you about it. \nShe comes to him and takes him into her arms. \nBETH It's all right. \n79   INT.

Montoya looks at her very carefully.  She stares right back at him. 
ISABELLA (cont'd) On the other hand...if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba...the lead?  Then let's do that.  Accept their deal.  After the load is received...we will close their eyes forever... 
She looks at Montoya squarely.  It hangs in the air.  In his strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a conclusion... 
MONTOYA Let's try a few runs with these partners, I think.  I will tell José... 
If Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it.  Montoya continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in stone.  He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes. 
He reaches for her hand and brings her to him.  She kisses him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his neck, and she runs her hands down him...

lands.  The door opens.  Isabella emerges.  CLOSER...she searches, looking for someone as she descends the ramp. Then... 
CROCKETT 
emerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane. 
ISABELLA'S 
expression changes, but she masks it. 
Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac.  There are two Suburbans.  One for her; one full of security.  Crockett and her meet.  No show of affection.  Her Secretary, carrying her briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban. 
INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - DOOR - NIGHT 
opens.  Crockett and Isabella climb in.  The rear is customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and a divider.  As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride in the front vehicle.  Doors close.  Windows go up.  Air conditioning comes on.  She raises the divider, blocking the driver and locks the doors.  They are sealed in the back. Alone.  And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's desperate...as if making love to him puts her world back in balance.  Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses... 
CROCKETT Hola, chica. 
ISABELLA Hola, viejo. 
He touches the side of her face. 
ISABELLA (CONT'D) Don't stop, bad man... 
As they continue, we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BARRANQUILLA NIGHTCLUB - TUBBS + GINA - NIGHT 
at the bar.  It's jammed.  "Cochi Loco" Yero and his permanent bodyguard, El Tiburon, pass, smile.  Tubbs introduces Yero to Gina, as his wife. 
Yero shakes Gina's hand.  He indicates to the bartender that Tubbs and Gina are to pay for nothing...and he moves towards an office.  Cobalt blue light illuminates his face, and his fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality.

deplaning his G-4 crosses to his armored Suburban. 
INT. SUBURBAN - MONTOYA 
climbs into the back.  It's also a traveling communications center, satellite uplink, encryption, the works... 
MONTOYA (to an Assistant) Do you have him? 
Assistant nods.  Montoya takes the heavy handset... 
MONTOYA (cont'd) José, about the Americans... 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. BARRANQUILLA CLUB, OFFICE - JOSÉ YERO 
JOSÉ YERO (in Spanish) They are "wrong."  I do not trust them. 
MONTOYA (V.O.) (in Spanish) Why? 
JOSÉ YERO (in Spanish) Too good at what they do, I don't know.  Something I don't like. They are wrong... 
Montoya thinks.

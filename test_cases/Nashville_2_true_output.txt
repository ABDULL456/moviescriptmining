TRIPLETTE'S VOICE I'm with ABC-TV. Like to come up and talk to you for a minute if I could. 
BILL starts to laugh. TRIPLETTE starts to laugh. BILL stops 
BILL Sure. 
He hangs up the phone and goes to the mirror, yelling at MARY. Momentarily, there is a KNOCK on the door. 
119	NEW ANGLE 
BILL walks to the door and opens it on TRIPLETTE'S sincere smile and extended hand. 
TRIPLETTE Hi. I'm John Triplette. 
BILL Hi. Come on in. Mary! 
TRIPLETTE enters the room and starts to take it in. MARY comes from the bathroom, her face swollen. BILL and MARY act as if nothing has happened. 
TRIPLETTE Hello. John Triplette. 
MARY Hello. 
TRIPLETTE Glad to meet you. 
BILL You want anything?  A drink? 
TRIPLETTE Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time. 
BILL Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home. 
TRIPLETTE laughs nervously. 
TRIPLETTE Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really. 
BILL Whose? 
TRIPLETTE Hal Phillip Walker. 
MARY Oh, no. 
TRIPLETTE He's pretty well known down here. 
BILL He's pretty well known all over. 
TRIPLETTE laughs again. BILL and MARY will be tough to convince. 
TRIPLETTE I was wondering if you'd like to be in it. It's going to be televised and... 
BILL lights a cigarette and takes a shot of tequilla out of the bottle on the floor. 
BILL What's he running for? 
TRIPLETTE President. 
MARY (horrified) President? 
BILL When is it? 
TRIPLETTE Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in... 
MARY For him? 
TRIPLETTE Yes. 
MARY smiles. 
MARY Well, we can't. We're registered Democrats. 
BILL ignores her. 
BILL National television? 
TRIPLETTE ABC. 
BILL How much? 
TRIPLETTE Minimum. 
MARY looks at BILL.

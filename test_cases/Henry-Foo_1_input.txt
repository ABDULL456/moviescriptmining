SHOOTING DRAFT 
EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY 
A garbage truck roars by and... 
Simon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old. 
The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to go punch out at the time clock. 
EXT. BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY 
Moments later. 
He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer. 
He begins to relax. This is his quality private time. 
Then he hears something and looks up. 
He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances and sees... 
Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having sex. 
Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then... 
WARREN (to Amy) You want some? 
Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up. 
Simon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as... 
Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt. 
Simon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast is clear, then returns just in time to see... 
Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her. 
The pipe falls from the young girl's hand. 
Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her. 
Simon's mouth falls open in awe. 
But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees... 
The amazed garbage man; caught. 
Amy starts screaming insanely. 
Simon runs for his life. 
Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase him away. 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Moments later. 
Simon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands there in the doorway catching his breath. 
His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different channel. 
FAY (to Simon) Where the hell have you been? (to Mary) Mom, come on and eat. 
MARY I'm not hungry. 
FAY (pissed) Then why'd I cook! 
Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in the evening. 
MARY I don't know why you cooked! I don't know why you bother! 
Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her brother. 
FAY Sit down and eat, Simon. 
Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more. 
Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it. 
He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out. 
He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach while... 
Fay and Mary look on in disgust. 
EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Moments later. 
Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach and spits, sickened. 
He looks up, though, and sees... 
A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing there in the street watching him. 
Simon tries to smile at her. 
But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.

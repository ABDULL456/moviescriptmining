ANGEL Oh my G-d.  This is so wild. 
They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled. 
INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 
Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne. Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand around. 
DAD I can't see shit.  You're all still here, right? 
Adrian enters.  They all cheer. 
JIMMY THE DEMON Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal in a jiffy, sir. 
DAD LIPS Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came through. 
ADRIAN Where's Nicky? 
JIMMY THE DEMON He came with you and Cassius, right? 
ADRIAN I came through that gate alone. 
JIMMY THE DEMON Sorry, sir, false alarm. 
DAD Boooo. 
ADRIAN Somebody explain what's going on. 
Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock. 
GATEKEEPER You'll get nothing out of me. 
ADRIAN Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips. 
He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the information immediately. 
GATEKEEPER The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely. 
ADRIAN How much time does Dad have before that happens? 
Adrian twists hard. 
GATEKEEPER Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power. 
Adrian throws him down. 
LUCIFER All boobs and no balls. 
ADRIAN Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you. 
He moves to the throne and throws the lips off. 
DAD LIPS Ahhh! 
He pushes Lucifer out of the way. 
LUCIFER I don't get no respect. 
ADRIAN Ten thousand years.  And I never once got to sit here. 
He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He grins as two horns grow out of his forehead. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Wow.  And this is just a little taste of my power. 
DAD Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons, get him out of the chair! 
The demons approach. 
ADRIAN Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested.  Anyone interested? 
The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy. 
INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY 
Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes. 
NICKY Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

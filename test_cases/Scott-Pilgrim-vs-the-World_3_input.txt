INTEGRATED FINAL 101. 
87 CONTINUED: 87 Scott walks forlornly down an empty street and bumps his head on a telephone pole. 'THONK'. 
'OH GOD WHY' 
A88 EXT. THE PARK - NIGHT / DAY / NIGHT A88 
Scott sits on the swings, staring straight ahead. Night turns to day. Day turns to night. Scott remains in the exact same position. 
STACEY (O.S.) Was she really the one? Scott looks over to see STACEY on the swing next to him. 
SCOTT The wha? 
STACEY I mean, did you really see a future with this girl? 
SCOTT Like...with jetpacks? Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug. 
STACEY Time heals all wounds, little brother. Maybe next time let's not date the girl with eleven evil ex- boyfriends. 
SCOTT Seven. 
STACEY Oh. Well that's not so bad. Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera. 
88 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 88 
Scott enters. Flicks the light on. Gets a shock. 
SCOTT Aaah! 
WALLACE (O.S.) 
TURN OFF THE LIGHT! Scott flicks the light off. Over PITCH BLACK...

88 CONTINUED: 88 
WALLACE (O.S) Presumably you just saw someone's junk, and I apologize for that. 
VOICE (O.S.) Sorry. 
SCOTT (O.S.) Was that Other Scott or Jimmy or someone? 
WALLACE (O.S.) Or someone. 
VOICE (O.S.) It's Chris. 
WALLACE (O.S.) It's Chris. 
89 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - LATER 89 
Scott sits in the chair, wrapped in a blanket. SOME GUY lies in Scott's usual futon spot (wearing Wallace's monogrammed robe). Wallace hands Scott cocoa. 
WALLACE Scott, you know I love you. But I need my own bed tonight. For sex. 
SCOTT Right. 
WALLACE I may need it the rest of the week too. 
SCOTT Right. And the year. 
SCOTT I get it. 
WALLACE Maybe you can move in with Ramona. Scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head. 
SCOTT She's with Gideon. 
WALLACE Ah. That sucks. But you know, it's probably just because he's better than you.

WALLACE He'll certainly have better hair. Scott nods.

INTEGRATED FINAL 103. 
89 CONTINUED: (2) 89 
WALLACE Either way, I think this fight is over. Scott nods. 
WALLACE You can sleep on the floor until you get somewhere else to stay. I got you muffs and blinkers in case this might happen. Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask. 
SCOTT Thanks. RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up. 
SOME GUY It's for Scott. 
SCOTT 
(TAKES PHONE) Hello? 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Hey, pal. Just wanted to say I feel terrible about earlier. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figured why not be the bigger man and give you a call. 
SCOTT Is Ramona with you? 
90 INT. GIDEON'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 90 
Gideon appears to sit on some kind of throne. He calls off. 
GIDEON GRAVES I don't know. Are you with me? 
RAMONA (O.S.) Yeah. 
SCOTT (O.S.)

SANDRO Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement, what disorder! They were very much concerned with scenographic effects... an extraordinary sense of liberty... 
There is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene before him. Then, giving voice to a sincere thought, he exclaims: 
SANDRO Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas... 
CLAUDIA And why did you drop them? 
SANDRO Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs. 
Claudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment, and Sandro becomes aware of it. 
SANDRO Why are you looking at me like that? 
CLAUDIA I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things. 
SANDRO I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays? 
The last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness, Sandro avoiding Claudia's glance. He laughs to himself and for a while remains silent. He takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings, then turns to Claudia. 
SANDRO Claudia, let's get married? 
CLAUDIA (astonished) What! Get married? 
SANDRO Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say? 
CLAUDIA What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me? 
SANDRO You look at me as though I had said something foolish... 
CLAUDIA And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me? 
SANDRO That's why I asked you... 
CLAUDIA So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8. 
Sandro smiles and playfully ruffles Claudia's hair. She also smiles, then slowly they both head towards the hotel. 
It is morning inside the Hotel Trinacria.  Claudia has just had breakfast in her room and is almost finished dressing. It is a rather large room, set out with old pieces of furniture. The place is in a state of disarray, and the door leading into Sandro's room is wide open. Because of the general disorder, Claudia is unable to find her stockings. But instead of being angered by this, she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily. As she continues to look for her stockings, Sandro appears in the doorway. 
SANDRO Are you ready? 
Claudia comes up to Sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration. 
CLAUDIA (ironically) But why am I so infatuated with you? 
SANDRO (smiling) Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside... 
CLAUDIA Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away... 
She starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to locate her stockings. Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music. It is a popular tune, wild and rhythmic, emanating from a publicity truck as part of some local advertising stunt. Claudia is overtaken by the music and cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for Sandro. Little by little, she starts swaying back and forth to the music. Then, kicking off her shoes, she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet. Sandro looks at her, amused but also somewhat impatient. 
SANDRO (leaving) Okay. I understand. See you later. 
Claudia rushes up to the door, and feigning an exaggerated attitude of despair, says:

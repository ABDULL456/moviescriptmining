{"train": "HENRY (V.O.) Our writing group meets every Tuesday night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's. Sometimes we rotate. \nJohn helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to some more. \nHENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) I love coming to the group. Everyone always has such constructive feedback. It's like we're all in this together. \nHANNAH I really like the way Yuri is developing, Colette. \nCOLETTE You do? \nJOHN Well, if you ask John K. Butzin... \nCan't help looking at the camera. Making sure it's on him. \nJOHN (CONT'D) You're still going to have to explain why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on her husband. Still kinda iffy to me. \nAnother glance at the camera: Did you get that? \nALAN I was bothered by that, too. Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed-up young punk? \nAll eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable. \nCOLETTE Oh.   Well...um...um... \nAn uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go creatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Oh God. I've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and-- \nALAN Poodles.     It's OK. \nCOLETTE No. It's not OK. I still can't explain Natasha's motive. What's the use? I'm not a writer. \nWilliam to the rescue. \nWILLIAM Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's good in bed. Trust me, that's all the motive she needs. \nJOHN Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three. Blow it up. Get the focus back on this broad--Natasha. \nHENRY --Yes. I was thinking the same thing. \nHANNAH Make it clear that Natasha wants to be closer... \nColette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement. \nHENRY (V.O.) Writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas. Here it really is all for one and one for all. \n11   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               11 \nLater that evening.    Meeting is over. \nAlan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter. \nCOLETTE Who wants coffee? \nEverybody does.    William taps Henry on the shoulder. \nWILLIAM Lend me ten bucks? I'm having cash flow issues. \nHENRY Sure. \nWILLIAM Thanks, bro'. You're the best. \n12   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       12 \nHenry sits at his desk, staring at the blank computer. Lost in thought. Emphasis on lost. \nHENRY (V.O.) This new novel Pizza to Go is about Scott, a pizza delivery guy in LA. He comes across some interesting characters. I like what I have so far, but it's only a hundred pages and I'm stuck... \n13   INT.   HENRY'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY                             13 \nHenry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment, wearing the Pizza Starz hat and shirt. Ready for work. \nHENRY (V.O.) ...Haven't written a word in the last two weeks. Not one. Hannah teases me about having writer's block. \n14   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               14 \n19   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- DAY                                     19 \nHannah leans forward towards the camera, as if to hear better. \nHANNAH My favorite writer? Favorite writer. Favorite writer... \nHannah goes blank. The smile disappears as her face goes into noticeable contortions. This is worse than Final Jeopardy. She turns quiet, squirming. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Favorite. Wow. Hard to say. I've studied Composition more than actual Literature. Gee. I know Maureen enjoys Jane... \nSearching for a last name, Hannah looks back to Maureen for help. \nMAUREEN Jane Austen. \nHANNAH That's the one. I hear she's good. But my favorite writer? Let me think about that a bit, OK? \nShort beat. Hannah lowers her voice, almost a loud confessional whisper. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) I didn't go to college. \n20   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                   20 \nJohn is holding court at his mobile home, showcasing the finest in furniture from Sears. John stuffs his home with various MILITARY ARTIFACTS--photos, equipment, books. He's got it all. John talks to the camera. \nJOHN Everything John K. Butzin knows about writing comes down to two simple words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom Clancy. The man's a genius. Does his research. All those nitty-gritty technical details. Now that's writing! John K. Butzin has one agent very interested in Roaring Lion. And a publisher up in Oxnard is looking at it as we speak. Plus a certain cousin's best friend has a neighbor who has an in with Clint Eastwood, so Hollywood might be calling soon. Don't know how the other members of the writing group will handle all this success by one person. They better not be pussies. \n21   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY              21 \nAlan and Colette remain on the couch. Talking to the camera. All smiles. Much more comfortable with the camera. \nALAN Well, I'm an optometrist in Glendale. \nCOLETTE And I write full-time. \nALAN Our last name's Mooney. You could call us Mooneys. We get that joke all the time. \nThe couple giggle at the joke. Forced. \nALAN (CONT'D) Which writer do I admire? Hmmm. How about John Grisham? Look at all that money he's made! Just teasing, John. We know you deserved every dime, but, hey, John, could you spread it around a bit, pal? \nCOLETTE Alan likes to tease. \nShe gives her husband an affectionate squeeze. \nALAN Colette, here, is the real writer. I'm more of an idea guy. I come up with great ideas, but don't always follow through. I'll show you. \nHe picks up his mini-digital Olympus RECORDER off the coffee table. Thinks for a second. \nALAN (CONT'D) (To recorder) Idea for romantic novel. \nAlan catches himself. \nALAN (CONT'D) No. Make that, idea for romantic ebook. \nHe winks at the camera--showing he's hip to the jargon. \nALAN (CONT'D) Possible movie option, too: Frovers. They couldn't be friends. They couldn't be lovers. So they became Frovers. \nSatisfied, Alan turns off the recorder. \n22   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       22 \nColette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a beautiful garden area. Quiet and private. Camera follows her over to a solitary BENCH. \nCOLETTE This is where I come for inspiration. I believe a writer must have quiet and solitude. I'll meditate. Write in my journal. Set out my creative path for the day. This is my Walden Pond. \nColette sits down on the bench. Takes in the environment. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Favorite author? I'd have to say Joan Didion. Her writing sends shivers down my spine. Though Joyce Carol Oates has been known to bring me to actual orgasm. \n23   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       23 \nColette sits on her bench, reading a BOOK. C.U. reveals that it is a novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Colette appears to be getting into the story just a bit too much. \n24   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                     24 \nALAN William's right. We'll start. She'll show up. \nWilliam starts passing out pages. Henry eyes the empty chair. Colette looks over William's pages. There are only three. She has a puzzled look. \nCOLETTE William, aren't these the same pages you read last time? \nWILLIAM Nope, they're different. \nJOHN They look the same. \nWILLIAM They're different. I changed a word. \nHENRY One word? \nCOLETTE That's it? \nWILLIAM Writing is rewriting, Colette. Bukowski said, \"Write five words. Rewrite seven.\" \nHENRY No. Dorothy Parker said that. \nJOHN One word?    Jesus H. Christ. \nWILLIAM It's my creative vision, John. \nALAN (Jumping in) Which we are here to support. This is William's decision. \nWILLIAM Let me just read. See if you can pick out the word. Tell me if it's better, or worse. \nJOHN (Muttering) One goddamn word. \nHenry continues staring at the empty chair. \n29   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      29 \nThe evening meeting is winding to an end. John stands up to stretch. Alan slides papers into his leather satchel. \nHANNAH'S CHAIR remains empty. Henry remains concerned. \nHENRY I wonder what happened to Hannah. \nALAN It's not like her to miss. \nThe mystery is quickly solved. Front door opens. In rushes Hannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried. \nHANNAH I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing the meeting. \nJOHN What happened? Your car break down? \nALAN You oversleep? \nCOLETTE Maureen. Is Maureen OK? \nWILLIAM People. C'mon. Look at her. That glow. Hannah met a guy. She got laid. \nHannah gives William a playful smack on the back. \nHANNAH As a matter of fact, I did meet a guy. \nWILLIAM Told ya. \nHANNAH His name's Brian. \nCheck out Henry. He looks absolutely horrified. No! \nHannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of the Grand Canyon. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) He's my new agent! \nShe remembers the camera. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) (Directly to camera) An agent. I've got an agent! \nSurprise and silence. The writers look at each other and then back at Hannah. Not quite sure how to react. \nStunned as Hannah turns her attention back to the group. \nHenry and Hannah arrive at her car. She unlocks the front door of her clunker-of-a-Ford as Henry waits. \nHENRY I'm so proud of you, Hannah. \nHANNAH Your turn will come, Henry. You're a better writer than I am. So much better. You went to college. \nHannah looks directly into the camera, pointing to Henry. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I knew him when. \nHenry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the camera. Tries to change the subject. \nHENRY Listen. Maybe some afternoon we could go for a drive. There are some special places I'd like to show you. \nHANNAH Sure. I can't believe I've lived out here four years and haven't seen -- \nShe stops in mid-sentence.   A light goes on in her head. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Oh, my. \nHENRY What? \nHANNAH Four years. It's been four years since I moved here. And now I have an agent. It's the number four again. My lucky number. I should have known this was going to happen. \nHENRY There is no one more deserving. \nHannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips.    And a warm hug. \nHannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the window. \nHANNAH I'm going to dedicate my novel to you. \nA final wave and Henry watches as she disappears into the night. He sighs. \n34   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - DAY                                        34 \nA series of shots featuring the writers writing--or, at least, trying: Alan pauses between eye appointments to record an idea. \nWilliam continues scribbling at the restaurant, this time eyeing WAITRESS #2. \nHannah, sitting cross-legged on her bed, types away on her laptop computer. \nColette sits on her private bench, seeking inspiration. \nJohn sits at his keyboard. Vintage black-and-white war movie plays on the TV. John appears more interested in the movie. \nHenry stares at his laptop. The screen is blank. Henry surrenders yet again and flips off the computer. \n35   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       35 \nHenry, sitting in his studio apartment, wears his pizza delivery outfit. Ready for work. Talks to the camera. \nHENRY I'm happy for Hannah. (MORE) \nHENRY (CONT'D) Still, her getting an agent sort of ruins my plans, doesn't it? I mean, Hannah has an agent. I don't. That won't work for dating. I can't ask her out until I get an agent. \nHenry gestures at a PHOTOGRAPH taped to the wall among his rejection letters. \nHENRY (CONT'D) That's Richard Benedict. He's written seven novels. Fantastic writer. \nINSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Richard Benedict. \nHENRY (CONT'D) The Fitzgerald of his generation. Richard Benedict made me want to be a writer. \n36   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 36 \nColette dressed in a leotard, practices basic yoga on a mat in her living room. Chanting. Overly dramatic, as always. \nTakes a break and talks to the camera. \nCOLETTE My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet. It's about a Russian woman who comes to this country in search of love. It was inspired by a story I heard from one of my massage clients, Yuri. Yes, it's true--I used to do massage. In fact, that's how I met Alan, though I certainly didn't give him the kind of massage he really wanted. At least not the first time. \nColette allows herself a slight smile at the memory. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) I will get an agent. It comes down to this: if Hannah can get an agent, I can get an agent. After all, I am a graduate of Mills College. \nHANNAH (To herself; counting on her fingers) Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o- n-e... \nShe can't finish the count. The ugly truth is staring her in the face. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) 13 letters.    Oh, dear... \nHannah and Maureen exchange concerned looks. \n38   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE   DAY                                          38 \nHannah and Henry sit together in the reception area. Alan breezes in, ever-smiling, greeting both enthusiastically. \n39   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                          39 \nRows of EYE GLASSES on display as Alan guides Hannah over to the fitting table. Henry tags along. \nHANNAH Thanks for seeing me today, Alan. \nALAN No problemo. Let's get you some new eye wear. \nHANNAH Something that makes me look smart. \nHENRY You're already smart, Hannah. \nHannah gives Henry's hand a playful squeeze: Thank you. Alan and Hannah sit down opposite from each other. Henry pulls up a chair to the side. Alan selects a pair. Puts them on Hannah. \nALAN How about... \nHannah shrugs her blase reaction. \nHANNAH Mmmmmmm. \nAlan removes the brown-colored frames.   Studies them for a second. Then -- inspiration arrives. \nALAN Excuse me.   One sec. \nHe reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Speaks into it. \nALAN (CONT'D) Ah. Name for character. Alexander Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses. \nHANNAH Of course he would. \nHenry nods, agreeing. Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder away and reaches for another pair of glasses. \nALAN You know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning. It's called Unleashed. \nAlan tries the second pair on Hannah. She checks herself in the mirror. Then she shows Henry. They both shake their head: No. It is a funny moment between friends. They laugh as Alan reaches for pair #3. \nALAN (CONT'D) It's about a dog who becomes human for 24 hours in order to rescue his kidnapped owner. I love this idea, Hannah. \nHANNAH Could be a winner. \nAlan puts the third pair of glasses on Hannah. She checks herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. She looks over towards Henry. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) What do you think? \nPoor Henry. She does look good. He's falling even harder for her by the moment. \nHENRY You look great, Hannah. \nHannah can't decide. She studies herself in the mirror as Henry studies her. Henry reaches for his ANDROID and snaps a photo of her. Alan brings them back to real time. \nALAN Question: You think your agent might be interested in this idea? Does he have a dog? \nHANNAH (Evading) Oh. I don't know-- \nALAN How about a cat? It could be a cat. \nHANNAH Um. Sure.   Probably could be. \nALAN Think about mentioning it to your agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog -- or cat -- becomes human. \nAlan beams with pride at his imagination on display. Hannah fidgets. Avoids Alan. Henry jumps in to save the moment. \nHENRY I'll help you develop the idea, Alan. \nFirst we see the FRAMED PHOTO of a certain business mogul. \nSIGRID (CONT'D) Herr Trump.    Very rich. Very famous. Very sexy. \nThen we move on to the second PHOTO of a certain TV celebrity. \nSIGRID (CONT'D) Herr Simon Cowell. Very rich. Very famous. Very sexy. \nMove on to the third PHOTO.     Hey, we know this person: \nSIGRID (CONT'D) Ja. My special guy. Herr Bootzin. About to become very rich. Very famous. Already very sexy. (Beat) Then maybe Sigrid Hagenguth becomes Mrs. John K. Bootzin, ja? \n44   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      44 \nColette sits. Focused on the WHITE ENVELOPE in one hand. Alan sits next to her, squeezing her other hand. Photo of Oprah on the other side. \nCOLETTE I know this is a rejection letter. I can't open this. I can't be rejected today. I take rejection so personally. \nALAN I bet it's good news. \nShe opens the envelope. Peeks inside. No letter. Just the SMALLEST POST-IT NOTE flutters out on to the ground. Colette picks it up. \nCOLETTE \"Sorry. Not interested.\" I knew it. How can such a big rejection come from such a small piece of paper? \nColette folds the Post-It Note in half--and then in quarters. Holding it in her hand, she begins to chant. Alan holds on to her hand and pats her on the back. Good husband. \n45   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      45 \nHannah and Maureen watch with interest and obvious appreciation as Henry, dutifully wearing his uniform, cleans their living room carpet. \nOpen PIZZA STARZ \u00cdBOX on the breakfast bar. Looks like Henry has brought dinner, as well. Hannah's iPhone goes off. As a courtesy, Henry stops the machine. \nHANNAH (On phone) Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Brian. (LISTENING) Really? (LISTENING) Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! \nHannah starts jumping up and down like a little girl while Maureen and Henry look on in bewildered anticipation. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) (On phone) Oh my god! \nMAUREEN What's he saying? \nHANNAH He sold my novel. \nHENRY What? \nHANNAH (Nodding excitedly) Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon! \nNow Maureen starts jumping up and down. Henry can't hide his surprise. \nMAUREEN Oh my god!   Oh my god! \nHANNAH (On telephone) Yes, Brian. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Promise. Thank you! \nHannah turns off her iPhone. Mother and daughter can't believe the news. Jumping up and down. Warm embrace. \nIn turn, they both embrace Henry, who also shares the genuine, sincere moment. \nHENRY You did it, Hannah!   You did it! \nMAUREEN I'm so proud of you, dear! \nHANNAH Thank you. \nAnother embrace between mother and daughter.   This could go on all night. \nHENRY We need to tell the group! \nThe smile disappears from Hannah's face. \nHANNAH The group. Oh, dear. The group. No, no, I can't tell them about this. \nHENRY Why not? \nHANNAH Oh. \nShe looks to Maureen for support. \nPuzzled looks are the reaction. \nALAN U.R. the Publisher? \nHENRY They self-publish. E-books. Print on Demand. \nJOHN That's right, Obert. But I'll have my book in two weeks. None of this B.S. waiting around. John K. Butzin will be a published author. And be published first. \nHANNAH (Ever-diplomatic) Well, John. Congratulations. \nShe leans over and gives him the briefest of hugs. There are other congratulatory murmurs coming from the group. \nALAN My, two published authors in the group. The rest of us are going to have to catch up. \n48   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  48 \nThe meeting gets down to business. Alan, Colette, Henry, William and Hannah, wearing her new glasses, listen as John reads from Roaring Lion. \nJOHN (Reading) Gunner stared out over the bleak horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong after another lay scattered on the bloody hillside. He had won this time, but Gunner knew Charlie would be back in the morning. By god, he would be ready. So would his M60 General Purpose Machine Gun and Mark 2 Fragmentation/Hand Rifle Grenade. \nJohn finishes and sits back in his chair, quite pleased with himself. \nALAN OK, John. Nicely done. Let's get some feedback. \nHenry, as always, has been making notes. \nHENRY Well.   In terms of the characters-- \nJOHN (Jumping in) --Hold on, Obert. I wanna hear from her. \nJohn points towards Hannah. \nALAN We'll hear from everybody. \nJOHN I don't want to hear from everybody. She has a book coming out. John K. Butzin has a book coming out. I want to hear from Hannah, author to author. \nWILLIAM Oh, screw you. \nALAN This is really going against the spirit of the group, John. Everyone's opinion is valid. \nJOHN Hers is more valid. What'd you think, Hannah? Tell me. \nHannah struggles to speak. Clearly uncomfortable. \nHANNAH I-I . . . \nThe words freeze in her mouth. Awkward silence. Finally. \nWILLIAM (Standing up) Going outside for a smoke. \nWilliam thunders away from the group. Colette watches him go. \nCOLETTE I'll go talk to him. \nColette follows, calling after William. \nALAN Let's take a fifteen minute break, shall we? \nEmbarrassed, Hannah excuses herself. Henry trails along after her, leaving a muttering John and calm Alan alone. Alan reaches for his recorder. Talks into it. \nALAN (CONT'D) Ahhh, idea for Michael Crichton-type novel. Members of Antarctic research station attacked by mutant penguins. \nSatisfied, Alan turns off the recorder while John reaches for more pizza. \n49   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                        49 \nColette is back on her bench. Standing behind her is a mysterious MAN (Over 40) who favors black clothes and dark shades. \nCAPTION: DR. XIROMAN \nCOLETTE I want you to meet someone special. This is my spiritual adviser. Doctor Xiroman has taken a vow of silence for one full year to protest climate change. What an amazing man. Dr. Xiroman is going to cleanse the air of all this rejection. \nCamera goes to Dr. Xiroman. Somber, expressionless. Does he even have a pulse? \nDr. Xiroman walks over to small fire pit and meditates as he places his hands over the rising flames. Colette begins a New Age chant for added support. \n53   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                           53 \nThe casually dressed MAN (40's) sits in the waiting area for Alan Mooney, spending time on his iPhone, conducting business as he waits. \nCAPTION: DAVID KELLER \nHe doesn't have to wait long. Alan personally comes out into the waiting area to fetch him. Big grin. Hand extended. \nALAN Dr. Alan Mooney. \nDavid, caught off guard by the doctor's sudden appearance, winds up his phone conversation. \nDAVID (on phone) Let me call you back. \nDavid stands up. \nDAVID (CONT'D) David Keller. \nThey shake hands. \nALAN I know. Big fan. Big fan. \nDavid can't help but notice the camera. \nALAN (CONT'D) Oh, that. They're doing a little documentary about my writing group. \nDAVID Really? \nALAN Just act natural. \nLowering his voice. \nALAN (CONT'D) It was supposed to be a reality series. \n54   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE -- EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                       54 \nStandard examination room. Alan guides David into the chair. \nALAN Great. Let's start out with a basic eye examination. \nAlan flips a couple SWITCHES. Eye reading CHART appears on the wall. Alan turns off the lights. \nALAN (CONT'D) OK, David. See if you can read that first line for me, please. \nDAVID (Reading) X7K6AC \nALAN Very good, David. Would you like to try for what's behind Door Number Three? Try this one, please. \nAlan brings up a different line on the screen. \nDAVID (Reading) E2PH8S \nALAN 20/25. Looking good, David. But anyone can identify simple letters and numbers. Let's see how you do reading a more challenging text. \nAlan brings up a different page. Several paragraphs on a printed page. \nALAN (CONT'D) See that? \nDAVID Yes. \nALAN Good. Read me the first paragraph, please. \nDAVID (Reading; monotone) Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly, consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri. \nALAN Oh. Very nice. Very nice. Now the next paragraph, please. \nDavid looks rather puzzled, but complies. \nDAVID (Reading; monotone) \"I never, ever thought I could feel this way,\" Natasha said excitedly. \"Nor could I,\" Yuri said happily, his body dripping with enormous beads of sweat. \nALAN Man. Wow. Gee. Isn't that great writing? My wife Colette wrote that. The patients just love reading her stuff. It's from her new novel, Nyet, Not Yet. \nA loud KNOCK on the examination room door. David is saved by the bell. \nALAN (CONT'D) My, I wonder who that could be. \nHENRY Yeah. Sure wish I knew what was going to happen with them. \nHannah gives Henry a friendly tap on the knee for encouragement. \nHANNAH You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll pass. Focus on your writing. No distractions. The writing comes first. \nHenry lets it sink in.   Changes the subject. \nHENRY Say, um, remember I offered to drive you around and show you a couple special places? \n58   EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT HOME - DAY                                   58 \nThe imposing house screams success.     Henry and Hannah sit in Henry's parked car, taking it in. \nHANNAH Who lives here? \nHENRY Richard Benedict. \nHANNAH Oh.   That writer you like? \nHENRY Like? No. It's much more than that. Wow. He...He... \nHenry struggles to put it into words. \nHENRY (CONT'D) ...Reading Richard Benedict...made me want to be a better writer. He's that good, Hannah. \nHANNAH Can't say I've read his stuff.     Nice house, though. \n59   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM HOME - DAY                                  59 \nHenry and Hannah stand on the sidewalk in front of the North Hayworth home. Henry seems barely able to contain his excitement. \nHENRY Here we are. \nHannah stares blankly at the house. \nHENRY (CONT'D) North Hayworth Avenue. Hollywood, California. \nHannah smiles politely, but it's clear she doesn't recognize the house. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Big clue time. Sheila Graham. \nStill nothing registers with Hannah. \nHENRY (CONT'D) OK. Give up? Writer Sheila Graham lived here. Fitzgerald was her lover. This is where he died on December \nHannah lets it all sink in. \nHANNAH Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot himself, right? \nHENRY No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald. He wrote The Great Gatsby. \nThe name doesn't register with Hannah. \nHENRY (CONT'D) (Reciting from heart) Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's-- \nHANNAH (Interjecting) I've never read it. \nHenry can't hide his surprise. \nHENRY What? \nHannah stops, cognizant of the ever-present camera. \nHANNAH (To camera) Could you turn that off for a few minutes, please? \nHENRY You know they can't. What's wrong? \nHannah hesitates.   Counts to three. Lowers her voice. \nHANNAH I've never read The Great Gatsby. \nHENRY You're kidding. \nHANNAH Henry. I never went to college. I've heard of Hemingway. A little. Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't have your education. Your smarts. I haven't read all these great novels. My stories come from my heart. \nHENRY Definitely. \n62   EXT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT / CITY STREET - DAY                       62 \nParked on the street in front of Hannah's apartment. Henry and Hannah, this mutual admiration society, stand by the car. Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby. Short beat. \nHANNAH What a dear, sweet friend you are. \nHannah graces Henry with another hug. Another quick peck on the lips. But wait--Henry wants more. He kisses her back. More than a peck. Too much more. Hannah, surprised, pulls back--her hand on his chest: Stop. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) (Gently) No distractions. The writing comes first, 'kay? \nHenry nods reluctantly: Understood. One last hug from Hannah before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her shoulder at Henry. Henry watches her leave, knowing that this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life. \n63   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    63 \nThe writing group meets. Hannah, Henry, John, William, Alan and Colette sit around the living room, pages in front of them. \nWRITERS AT WORK sign on display. \nMaureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to writer, carrying a large TRAY OF VEGGIES. \nALAN Alright.   Whose turn is it to read? Henry? \nAll eyes on Henry. He shifts uncomfortably in his chair. \nHENRY Oh. Um. Someone else go. I don't have anything new ready tonight. \nConcerned looks all around. \nCOLETTE It's been weeks, Henry. \nHENRY I know.   Still can't focus. \nJOHN Don't be a pussy, Obert. Get writing. Complete the mission. \nHANNAH Writer's block can be very serious, John. \nJohn scoffs in disbelief. Maureen offers William some veggies. He helps himself and checks out Maureen as she moves on to Alan. \nWILLIAM What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've got Scott and Christy. Two friends. Tell their story. \nHENRY That's the problem. I think the story's changing. \nALAN Changing?   How so? \nHENRY Lately I'm feeling something much deeper, much richer. Scott and Christy, um, growing closer. \nThe other group members appear puzzled. \nCOLETTE Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author in Beverly Hills. How close can they get? \nHENRY Follow me. Something happens. Christy has an epiphany. She-She realizes her feelings run much deeper now for Scott. \nHenry does everything he can not to look at Hannah. Short beat. \nWILLIAM Nah.    Don't buy it. \nJOHN They're friends. Why muck it up? Don't put 'em in the same foxhole. \nCOLETTE Is this Scott wanting to go beyond the friendship? There's no way Christy would suggest it. What do you think, Hannah? \nALAN Yes. Hannah, what do you think? \nAll eyes go back to Hannah.     She does not want to answer. \nHANNAH Gee, I-I guess...I really never thought of them that way. \nHENRY Never? \nHannah shakes her head.   Chooses her words carefully. \nHANNAH No. It's always been a friendship. \nHenry takes a moment.   Thinking. \n68   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                     68 \nFull meeting of the writing group, all crammed around the dining table. Henry and Hannah sit apart. \nA single BOWL OF PRETZELS has been placed before them. Hannah reads from her typed pages. Alan, William, Colette, and Henry hang on her every word. \nJohn is half-listening at best, more interested in the MAGAZINE he's thumbing through. \nWilliam REACHES UNDER THE TABLE and gently squeezes Colette's hand. Surprised, she pulls her hand away. \nHANNAH (Reading; with feeling) \"Please come home, Michael.\" \"Why would you want to marry me, Kyra? I barely graduated high school.\" \"Michael, I don't care about some silly college degree. You're the most intelligent person I've ever known. You are my shining star.\" \nThen Colette puts it back and squeezes William's hand. It's his turn to be surprised. \nHannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone to react. The room falls silent. Alan steps in. \nALAN OK.   Comments. Anyone? \nNo response. Group members look at the pages.      At each other. No one steps forward. \nHANNAH I value your feedback.    We're all in this together, right? \nNobody bites. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Colette--Did the new scene work for you? \nColette seems thrown by the direct question. \nCOLETTE Oh...Gee...Hannah. What? I mean, you're being published. This is being published. \nHANNAH But my editor wants rewrites.      Am I on track? \nColette punts.   Alan jumps in to save his wife. \nALAN Of course you are, Hannah. \nWILLIAM You got the deal. You got the check. First one to be published. \nJohn CLEARS HIS THROAT rather loudly: What about me, butthead? William ignores him. \nALAN I think what I'm hearing from the group is...is...you're fine. We all love it. Nothing here to critique. You don't need us--well, it's not that you don't need us, but, you know... \nAlan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper. More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction. Finally looks to Henry for help. \nHANNAH What do you think, Henry? \nAll eyes on Henry. He hesitates.   Then -- \nHENRY Yes. Actually, it is really good, but there are a couple things--little things--I'd point out. For example-- \nJOHN Holy Douglas MacArthur -- \nAll eyes on John. Finally holds up magazine to reveal that he's been reading VARIETY. \nJOHN (CONT'D) (Reading) \"Hollywood decides to go sleeping on the moon. (MORE) \nJOHN (CONT'D) First-time scribe Hannah Rinaldi, repped by Brian Barkley of SoHo, scores six-figure movie deal. Ink is still fresh, but Barkley boasts keen interest by...\" \nJohn keeps reading. Various reactions, mostly muted, around the table. Can Hannah's face turn any redder? \n69   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - NIGHT                                      69 \nMembers of the writing group struggle to deal with Hannah's latest success: \nAlan and Colette sit on their living room couch together, wearing matching pajamas, staring straight ahead like zombies. His tape recorder sits on the coffee table. Alan reaches for it. She grabs it from his hand and throws it. \nWilliam sits at the counter of Restaurant #2, drumming his fingers on the legal pad, half-heartedly trying to write. WAITRESS #3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye contact with him. William ignores her. \nJohn sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't concentrate. Gives up. Shuts down computer. Flips on TV. Another war movie. \nHenry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters. \nHannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep, deep sigh. A lot weighs on her mind. \n70   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY - DAY                    70 \nDr. Xiroman places a comforting hand on her shoulder, trying to calm Colette down. \n78   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      78 \nSitting outside in the cheap lawn chairs with Sigrid, John addresses the camera. He cleans up pretty good. \nJOHN This is going to be a great day for John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First official book signing. \nSigrid holds up a copy of Roaring Lion. The dog on the cover has had an image of a lion slapped over it. Sigrid beams with pride. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Ready and raring to go. Of course, it would have been better to do this in an actual bookstore, but, hell, they're dropping faster than Charlie at Dak To. Not to worry. Since Sigrid works at the hardware store, they're going to let her favorite author sign a few books there. \nSIGRID More than a few books. Many, many books, Ja? \nJOHN Ja, my Strudel. Many books. \n79   EXT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          79 \nSIGNS in front window announcing hammers, ladders, paint on sale. Also a handwritten PIECE OF PAPER taped to the window with masking tape, announcing AUTHOR SIGNING. \n80   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          80 \nJohn sits at his card table in the corner. Alone. A stack of books sit piled in front of him. CUSTOMERS walk all around, ignoring John completely. John tries to stay relaxed, smiling and nodding at people, not being too forceful. \nSigrid, wearing her little red work vest and glasses, stands off to the side, beaming with pride. She hurries over to a cash register, takes the telephone out of her surprised boss' hand, and jumps on the store's PA SYSTEM, blasting throughout the store. \nSIGRID (On PA system) Attention shoppers. Famous author, Mr. John K. Bootzin, signing new best seller. Up front of store. John K. Bootzin. Also, special today in plumbing department. Ballcocks. Two for one. All customers guaranteed will be satisfied. Ja. \n81   INT. HARDWARE STORE -- DAY                                       81 \nThe PILE OF BOOKS seems untouched. \n82   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                        82 \nStill no takers.    Sigrid comes over to console him. \nJOHN Sorry, Strudel. Seem to be shooting blanks today. \nJohn looks past Sigrid. His face brightens. A smiling Alan has arrived, flanked by Colette, Henry and Hannah. Hannah holds a cupcake. Alan has a bottle of champagne and some plastic cups. But there is no touching, no direct interaction, between Colette and Alan. \nALAN Author!    Author! \nJohn stands up.    Clearly touched. \nJOHN Hey-Hey. The cavalry's arrived. Look who's here. \nSIGRID Hello, everyone! \nHANNAH Wouldn't miss your signing, John. \nHannah presents John with the cupcake and leans in for a friendly peck on the cheek. Colette aims her cell phone camera at John. \nCOLETTE Smile, John! \nJohn half-smiles in response. Henry reaches over and shakes his hand. \nHENRY Congratulations, John. \nJOHN Thanks, Obert. Where's the Bukowski wannabe? \nAwkward silence as the group members exchange puzzled looks. \nHANNAH William said he'd meet us here. \nJOHN What a turd.     Never liked that punk anyway. \nALAN Maybe he's still at our house. \nCOLETTE Maybe he is.     Maybe I should go see. \nALAN Maybe you should. \nWhat's that about? Henry studies John's book.       Flips to the back cover. Surprised. \nHENRY This is in Chinese. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. We could have been so hot together. I'm just as good a writer as you are, but you sure look better in a skirt -- \nHENRY (Voice rising) That's enough. \nWILLIAM I don't need any of you. I don't need any of your pointless, pedestrian feedback. I'm a writer. \nJOHN You've got goddamn three pages. \nWILLIAM They're a great three pages! You just don't appreciate my dedication. \nHANNAH You're a pretend writer, William. \nSilence.   William is surprised that Hannah speaks out. \nHENRY She's right. You act the part. You like the lifestyle. You hit on women. You quote Bukowski. But Bukowski did the work. Each and every day he wrote. That's your problem, William. You don't do the work. \nWILLIAM I don't do the work? Man, that sounds frickin' hilarious coming from you. When's the last time you wrote anything? \nThat hits a nerve. William and Henry stare each other down. Enough. William flips off the group with his middle finger. Mumbling, grumbling under his breath, he starts to leave. Pauses at the WRITERS AT WORK sign. Picks it up. \nALAN Not the sign! \nToo late. William RIPS it in two. And a second time for good measure. Throwing the pieces on the ground. Stomps out of the house, slamming the front door. \nThe group turns quiet for a long beat. Everyone calming down. \nAlan takes control again -- eyes still darting over to what's left of his beloved sign. \nALAN (CONT'D) Let's move on. Next item. Richard Benedict is going to be doing a signing at Wordsmith next week. \nAlan looks directly at Henry. \nALAN (CONT'D) Who wants to go? \n86   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              86 \nLarge bookstore. Long line. Why? Because Richard Benedict is in the building, doing a signing of his new novel The Pineapple Man. \nHannah, Henry, Alan, and Colette stand in line together, waiting. Colette is holding one copy of the BOOK. Hannah has one. Henry has one. \nAlan reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Snaps it on. \nALAN Idea for novel. Jealous husband murders his tramp-of-a-wife and buries her chopped-up body in the back yard. \nColette pretends not to hear. Line inches forward. Alan cranes his neck to see what's happening. \nHENRY (To himself) Mr. Benedict, I just want to thank you. No. You've inspired my writing-- No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're the greatest... \nColette puts a friendly hand on Henry's shoulder. \nCOLETTE Let me tell you something, Henry. \nHenry looks to her, expecting words of comfort. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) One day, I'll have a signing like this. \nColette looks around, already imagining the event. \n87   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    87 \nJohn is bent over his PRINTER, jiggling the front end, trying to open it. Tapping it on the side. No luck. \nJOHN Nope. Not going to see Richard whatever-his-name-is. John K. Butzin, author, doesn't need to stand in line anymore. No, sir. This soon- to-be best-selling writer is spending every minute, every dollar, on promoting Roaring Lion. \nTry as he might, John can't open up his printer. Sigrid appears. Leans in. Effortlessly opens up the printer. Takes the cartridge from John. Snaps it in. Shuts the lid. Done. John grunts his thanks. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Strudel, check my sales ranking again. \nSigrid steps to the computer and taps a couple keys. Stares at the screen. \nSIGRID (Reading out loud) \nNot quite the hoped-for response. Turns quiet inside the mobile home. John clears his throat. \nJOHN Wow. Look how far I've moved up already. \nThe young MALE ASSISTANT behind the counter, obviously paid to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in large letters: NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. \nColette and Dr. Xiroman will not be deterred. She holds a thick MANILA ENVELOPE. \nCOLETTE I have to see Ms. Piper. We just need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes of her time. \nThe assistant points back to the sign. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Can you just please stick your head in her office, tell her that Colette Mooney is here. I know she's busy, but she'll certainly want to see my manuscript. \nThe assistant ignores her. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) (Flustered) I'm a graduate of Mills College. \nBehind them, coming from the inner office, we hear LOIS PIPER YELLING. \nLOIS (O.S.) If I have to read one more vampire story, I swear I'll drive a stake through my own goddamn heart. \nMANUSCRIPT comes flying out of her office. Loose pages splatter everywhere in the main office. Lois Piper quickly follows. Older. Tired. Needs a drink. Now. \nCAPTION: LOIS PIPER \nLOIS (CONT'D) Vampires! Zombies! Harry Potter knock-offs! People writing about their dogs! Just shoot me now! \nIt is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera. Caught off-guard. What the hell??? Colette cranes her neck over the assistant. \nCOLETTE Ms. Piper?   Ms. Piper? \nLois turns her attention to Colette. Who are you? Then-- magically--Lois changes. A big smile replaces the scowl. She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a warm reception. \nLois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands with Dr. Xiroman. \nLOIS Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're here. How lovely to see you again. \nDr. Xiroman nods his head in greeting. \nLOIS (CONT'D) Just in the neighborhood? Please come in for a minute. \nAnother glance at the camera. Then, taking Dr. Xiroman by the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely snubbing a bewildered Colette. \nLOIS (CONT'D) My family talks about you all the time. You were so helpful to my sister. She's doing much better. \nColette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk away. The assistant points in their direction: Get in there! \n96   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                          96 \nLois plops down behind her desk. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS cover her desk. Dr. Xiroman sits quietly in one chair. Colette sits next to him. \nLOIS (Sighing; Distraught) Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look at all this. Do you know what it is? Crap. It's all crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life. \nDr. Xiroman nods: I understand. \nLOIS (CONT'D) Know what I feel like doing? \nShe looks at the camera. \nLOIS (CONT'D) Come in closer. I want you to get this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer. \nSatisfied, Lois takes her free hand and SHOVES ALL THE MANUSCRIPTS off her desk, sending them flying on the floor. \nLOIS (CONT'D) Wheeeeee! \nColette looks aghast.   Lois seems free at last. \nLOIS (CONT'D) That was so...liberating. I haven't felt this good since that night in Paris with Salman Rushdie. \nLois growls like a tiger at the memory. \nLOIS (CONT'D) I envy you, Dr. Xiroman. Know that? Look at your life. Your work. You helped my sister. You've helped so many people. You have such a positive message to share. \nThe camera picks up on Lois as the light goes on, the wheels start turning in her head. \nLOIS (CONT'D) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. A positive message to share. Helping people. That's it! \nCOLETTE (Confused) What? \nHANNAH He's making me a better writer. \nHENRY Yeah.    I bet he is. \nQuietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera. \nHENRY (CONT'D) How much better are you, Hannah? Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse Five? D'ya know? \nHANNAH Henry.    Don't. \nHENRY No, No. This could be quite educational. How about Native Son? Catch-22? \nHANNAH Why isn't it enough that I'm your friend? \nHENRY Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's Complaint? Do you know any author? Harry Potter--You must know Harry Potter. \nHANNAH Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing? \nHENRY --Sophie's Choice? Anything published in the English language. \nHANNAH --That I believe in you? \nHENRY You didn't read Gatsby, did you? Never even opened it, I bet. \nEnough. \nHANNAH I'm not-- \nShe hesitates.   Not for long. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) I'm not the one delivering pizzas for a living. \nScore one for Hannah. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) I'm not the one wasting my talent. You've read all those books, sure, but my book is being published. Is yours? \nHenry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving Henry alone. \nOnly then do we notice the number of the house: 4441. \n101   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   101 \nWe've never seen Henry like this. He rips down all his Richard Benedict photos from the wall. Collects all his Benedict books. Stuffs everything in a CARDBOARD BOX. Next he turns his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall. Lot of rejection. Gives them a long look. Then he snaps up the photo of Hannah from near his computer. He takes the photo and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection letters. \nHenry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed by Hannah's radiant smile. His latest, and most painful, rejection. It's over. \nHenry understands what must be done. He goes over to his desk. Sits down at his laptop. One last glance over at Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on. \nHe contemplates for a second. Then begins typing. \n102   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    102 \nSigrid's Wall of America has been taken down. A few nail holes and tape marks are all that remain--except for the single PHOTO of John still hanging in the center. \n103   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      103 \nBack to the two lawn chairs--with one prime difference. Sigrid's chair is empty. John sits by himself. This is a softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera. \nJOHN Well, Strudel shipped out. \nA side glance to the empty chair. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Oh, she wanted to stay, but... I didn't have time for a relationship. Not with my book selling like it is. She, well, she became collateral damage. Hated to end it. What a dame. I mean...Sigrid. She had the smarts of my first wife. The body of my second wife. Thank god she wasn't anything like my third wife. I did the right thing. Yes, sir. \nGood acting, John. He looks back to the empty chair. Can't avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love tap. \n104   INT.   JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    104 \nJohn packs COPIES OF HIS BOOK ever-so-carefully into an old standard issue military DUFFEL BAG. \nJOHN (V.O.) What matters now is that the Roaring Lion book tour is about to begin. Can't wait to hit the road and meet the good people of this nation. Good American people. \nJohn gazes over at his photo on the wall. Salutes himself. \n105   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               105 \nALAN Stop it... \nCOLETTE No, this is what it's all about. The spotlight always has to be on Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her book deal. Her movie deal. \nJohn shoots to his feet. \nJOHN News flash for you all. John K. Butzin is also saying Sayonara. Heading off on my international book tour. \nHENRY International? \nJOHN Damn straight. Tijuana. (Beat) I'm done with you pussies. \nJohn snatches up his folder and marches out of the house. Silence. Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions for Xiroman to join her. Final straw for Alan. Stares directly at Colette. \nALAN Get out.    Now. \nColette can't believe what she's hearing. \nALAN (CONT'D) As the leader of this writing group, I've determined your actions are contrary to our stated purpose. Get out. \nCOLETTE You can't kick me out.    I live here. \nShe's right.    Alan considers his options. \nALAN Fine.   Then go to your room. \nPoints to Xiroman. \nALAN (CONT'D) And take him with you. Won't be the first guy. \nAlan means business.   Colette stands up straight.   Gathers up her materials. \nCOLETTE We'll certainly have plenty to discuss in therapy. \nALAN Go by yourself. I'm done. \nCOLETTE Oh. Just like always--Alan finishes first. \nShe grabs Dr. Xiroman's arm. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Come, Dr. Xiroman. I'm looking forward to working with a real doctor. On our new book. \nColette and Dr. Xiroman disappear. Frustrated, Alan takes a deep breath. Reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder. Turns it on. \nALAN Idea for novel. \nAlan hesitates. Thinks for a second. Turns off the recorder. Slides it across the table to Henry. \nALAN (CONT'D) Here. Take it. Maybe you can use some of my ideas in your novel. \nAlan flashes a \"thumbs up\" sign to Henry and to Hannah.    He starts to leave, but remembers the camera. \nALAN (CONT'D) (To camera) This was supposed to be a reality series. \nThat's off his chest. Alan leaves Henry and Hannah alone at the table. Awkward silence. \nHe stands up. Calmly puts his typed pages back in his satchel. Leaves Alan's recorder on the table, walks away without looking back. \nHANNAH Henry . . . \nDon't waste your breath. He's gone. \n106   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              106 \nHannah's book release party. Great turnout. Her professional PHOTO adorns a POSTER announcing the publication of Sleeping on the Moon. Boy, Hannah looks terrific in that photo. Richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand. Maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of well-wishers. TABLE prominently centered has piles of Hannah's novel, waiting to be signed. \nHannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant. This is her day and she is more than ready for her close-up. Totally different in wardrobe and appearance. \nHANNAH Exciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous. I don't know half these people. Most of them are Richard's friends. \nHannah waves to Richard. He waves back. Hannah glances around the room, as if looking for someone in particular. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Nobody's showed up from my old writing group. Not one. Probably shouldn't be surprised. Haven't really heard from anyone in months. \nShe is asked a question. \nALAN (V.O.) After I sent Colette packing, I was ready for a new chapter in my life... \nSATURDAY'S ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES. \nPUPPET MAKING meets in Room 22, and QUILTING is in Room 24. WRITING 20/20 is in Room 26. \nAnd DOG OBEDIENCE is out in the courtyard, but we already know that--the loud sound of BARKING DOGS and PEOPLE YELLING \"SIT\" is heard in the background. \nSecond poster is a new version of QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT WORK. \nALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) I found it teaching Adult Ed. \"Writing 20/20\" is the class. Helping writers to see. Inspired by my new self- published e-book of the same title. \n116   INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY                                        116 \nSTUDENTS scattered around the classroom. All adult. Ethnic and demographic mix. Listening attentively. Taking notes. The DOGS continue barking outside. \nAlan stands in front of the class. Beaming. Excited, He CLAPS his hands once. \nALAN OK. You've got ten seconds. Write down the name of your character. First name that pops into mind. C'mon. Tell me your character. \nStudents think for a second. Start scribbling a name. \nALAN (CONT'D) 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-9.5-9.75-10 seconds. OK. Pass your names up front here. Let's see what you came up with. \nStudents hand their papers forward. Alan starts collecting them. \nALAN (CONT'D) The right name is so important for your character. OK. What do we have? \nHe looks at the first piece of paper. \nALAN (CONT'D) Here's one I haven't heard. Heywood Ja-Jabloom??? \nThat's not it.   Alan tries again. \nALAN (CONT'D) Or is it Jablom? Maybe Jablowme. Heywood Jablowme? \nLaughter and guffaws from the students.    Alan looks puzzled. \nALAN (CONT'D) What's so funny? Heywood Jablowme? Am I missing something?

COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       118 \nColette engages in intense meditation on her bench. The garden around her is now dead. \nCOLETTE (V.O.) Dr. Xiroman and I wrote our book. It actually did fairly well. \nINSERT BOOK. Title in large letters: Getting from Xiro to One by Dr. Xiroman in equally large letters. At the bottom of the book, in very tiny letters, reads With Colette Mooney. \nCOLETTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Dr. Phil turned us down. But we had a lovely time on Anderson. \nINSERT PHOTO of smiling Anderson Cooper. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Anderson actually wanted us back, but Dr. Xiroman and Lois Piper started dating. They eloped to Vegas last month. Off on a world cruise. \nINSERT PHOTO of Dr. Xiroman and Lois being married in Vegas by ELVIS. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) So in less than a year, I've lost my husband, my co-author, and my agent. But I still have Nyet, Not Yet. And I will find an agent to sell my novel. Look. I bought an ad in the trades. \nColette reaches for her reading glasses and shares the ad copy with us, reading aloud: \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) \"The magic fingers that just typed the publishing world's next best selling novel are now waiting to provide free massage to interested literary agents. Experienced. Sensitive. Discreet. Memorable. No Junior Agents, please.\" \nLooking quite pleased with herself, Colette lets the copy fall away. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) It's how I met my last husband. I think it can work again. No worries. After all, I am a graduate of -- \nHer iPhone starts playing music, signaling a phone call.

FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- HOLLYWOOD - DAY \nNorth Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree- lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex set back from the curb. \nCAPTION: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA \nOur narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30). \nHENRY (V.O.) This is where where F. Scott Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940. \nINSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life. \nHENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fitzgerald was one of the truly great American writers of the 20th century. Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon. This Side of Paradise. And, of course, my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing movies that never got made. Drinking too much. Alienating people. Losing his way. \n2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY \nHenry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope. Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment, more with reverence than curiosity. \nCAPTION: HENRY OBERT \nHENRY (V.O.) I stop by here sometimes--out of respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing gift. \n3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS \nHenry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He unlocks the car. Swings open the back door. \nHENRY (V.O.) But he wasted it. He wasted his talent. \nHenry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One last glance at the fabled apartment complex. \nHENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I sell my novel, I won't make his mistakes. \n4   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain. \nCAPTION: DR. ALAN & COLETTE MOONEY \nThey look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera. \nALAN We thought this was going to be a reality series. \nCOLETTE You know, like the Kardashians. \nThey listen.    Here comes the bad news. \nALAN Oh. Really? A documentary? This is going to be a documentary about our writing group? \nCOLETTE The whole group. Not just us, right? Not that it should be just about us... \nNervous laugh. \nALAN No. \nThey look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask their disappointment. \nCOLETTE So this is going to be like--like what I saw the other night on cable? About bees mating. \nALAN Or that, um, that one about the Holocaust. \nColette nods, remembering. \n", "test1_true": "COLETTE --Powerful. \nALAN Powerful.   Yes.

Colette, convinced she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES. The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming. \nThree others round out the group: \nYounger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera. \nCAPTION: WILLIAM BRUCE \nThe OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy. \nCAPTION: JOHN K. BUTZIN \nFinally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic, WOMAN listening intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on her way here. \nCAPTION: HANNAH RINALDI \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) ...Any second that she might explode, her chastity spraying across the ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti. Natasha never thought such a moment possible. \"Have I satisfied you, Natasha?\" Yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka-soaked lovemaking. \"Nyet, Not yet,\" Natasha stated, exhausted, but grateful. \nAwkward silence around the table as Colette removes her reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking cheerful. \nALAN Well?   Comments? \n6   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       6 \nHenry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic crates. \nThere are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the small apartment. \nWe are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill couch, watching TV. \nFinally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his accomplishment. \nHENRY (V.O.) I graduated from the University of Illinois. English major. Taught high school for a couple years, but hated it. Moved out here to be a writer. \n7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             7 \nAs Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell. \nHENRY (V.O.) I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for a writer. \n8    INT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             8 \nHenry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed MOTORCYCLE DUDE points to a dirty spot: Over here. \nHENRY (V.O.) You meet lots of interesting people. \n9    INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       9 \nHenry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on phrases like \"We regret to inform you,\" or \"Sorry, but this story isn't right for us,\" or \"The Baxter Agency currently isn't accepting new clients.\" \nHENRY (V.O.) I have two unpublished novels. Working on my third, Pizza to Go. These are my rejection letters. Rejected by agents. Rejected by publishers. When you think about it, it's pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you. \n10   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               10 \nHenry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and shrimp has been set out. \n", "test2_input": "HENRY Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know, the guy who just held up the line for five minutes talking to you? \nALAN (Over his shoulder) Ten. It was closer to ten minutes. \nHANNAH I don't know. We just talked. \nHENRY He sure liked you. \nHANNAH We just talked, Henry. I mentioned my book. He started asking about it. Writer to writer. No big deal. \nHENRY No big deal? Talking to Richard Benedict. No big deal! \nColette keeps walking. Biting her lip. Very quiet. \nALAN You gave him your phone number. \nHANNAH Look, a guy like that reads more books in a week than I ever have. Why would he bother call-- \nJust then, Hannah's iPhone goes off. She answers. The other three stop in their tracks. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) (On telephone) Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard. Hi. \nCOLETTE Unbelievable. \nHenry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back, creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her back on Henry. \nHANNAH (On telephone) Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know, Richard. I really appreciate the invitation, but-- \nShe listens. Her face is anguished. Finally -- \nHANNAH (CONT'D) This isn't a good time. Call me later. Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye. \nHannah turns off her phone. Alan, Colette, Henry stand there, gaping jaws wide open. \nALAN Amazing. \nCOLETTE This isn't fair. This just isn't fair. \nHANNAH What? \nCOLETTE First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie deal. \nALAN Please don't. \nCOLETTE No. This isn't fair. And now Richard Benedict wants to have coffee with you? All this is happening to you. And only you. Isn't there anything -- I don't know--some kind of cosmic creative crumb for the rest of us to nibble on? \nHANNAH I don't like what you're suggesting, Colette. You know how hard I work. How devoted I am. And I have been totally supportive of your writing. I've encouraged you all along. \nCOLETTE You wouldn't introduce me to your agent. \nHANNAH Brian didn't want to meet you. I asked. \nALAN Hannah has earned her success. \nCOLETTE Butt out Mr. Idea Man. \nALAN Hannah is a writer. She devotes herself one hundred percent to writing. Not one hundred percent to sleeping with writers. \nHenry steps in.    Finally. \nHENRY Why don't you two just go on ahead? \nCOLETTE It's not fair that she be the only one. \nHENRY Go. \nALAN C'mon.    Let's go. \nColette marches off in a huff; Alan in pursuit. She looks over her shoulder, shouting back at Hannah. \nCOLETTE \n90   EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY                                              90 \nHenry and Hannah sit on opposite ends of the bench.

She finally notices the camera. \nCOLETTE I know. I'm a shit for exploding at Hannah, aren't I? \nRuns her hands through her hair. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Poor, sweet, superstitious, everybody- loves-Hannah. \nStarts massaging forehead--trying to reduce stress. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) If she can succeed, so can I. \"We were born to succeed, not to fail.\" \nHears a question O.S. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Who said that? I don't know. Somebody famous. Somebody with an agent. \nNow come the deep breaths.      More stress control. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) I can't accomplish anything without an agent. They won't come to me. Fine. I'll go to them. I'll make it happen. \n92   EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY                                               92 \nHannah and Henry remain on the bench.      Hannah takes a breath and finally breaks her silence. \nHANNAH Your writer's block? \nHENRY Yeah. \nHANNAH It's because your focus is always on everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald. Me. \nWhoa. Henry isn't about to argue. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Listen to me, Henry Obert. Your writing must come first. Take this passion you have. Put it on the page. Forget everything else. All you're doing is wasting... \nHannah continues the lecture, speaking from the heart. \nHENRY (V.O.) She's right. But I know what's really happening here. Hannah's telling me she has every intention of talking to Richard Benedict. She has every intention of seeing him. \n93   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                         93 \nThere. On the discount table up by the cash register lies a pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade SIGN: 50% OFF! Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet contemplation. Heavy sigh. \nSigrid glances up. Her boss watches her from the cash register with a certain longing. He smiles. Sigrid returns the smile. \nBack to business. Sigrid pulls a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from her hip pocket. Counts quickly. Then picks up John's books, one by one. \n94   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                     94 \nJohn looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store.   In total shock as he clutches a handful of TWENTIES. \nJOHN Wow! All the books sold at the hardware store? \nSIGRID Ja.   Every one. \nJohn claps his hands together. There is a certain spring in his feet. \nJOHN Didn't I tell you, Strudel?   Write it and they will read. \nJohn can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile home, his mind racing. Sigrid is more composed. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Get some more copies down there. Maybe do another signing. Yeah. No. Time for a real tour. Fresno. Bakersfield. Stockton. Call a few bookstores. Let 'em know John K. Butzin is coming. Lock and load. \nAnd he's off, leaving the frame, already planning his big adventure, leaving Sigrid alone. \nFacing the camera, she nods slightly. Then offers us a small wave. \nSIGRID Bye.   Bye. \n95   INT. LOIS PIPER AGENCY - DAY                                      95 \nThe small reception area for The Lois Piper Agency. Tastefully decorated. PHONES constantly chirping. \n", "test3_input": "HANNAH Oh, c'mon.   You'll -- \nThen -- BAM, Henry, not looking where he's going, slams into Richard accidentally, spilling Richard's drink all over the author. Horrified looks all around. \n108   EXT. OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE - DAY                                       108 \nOutside the bookstore, Henry stands on the sidewalk, talking to the camera as he clutches Hannah's book. \nHENRY Well, I did it. I showed up to Hannah's signing. I congratulated her. I supported her, writer to writer. And I finally got introduced to Richard Benedict--formally. Sort of. \nHenry opens up his copy of Hannah's novel. He turns quiet, obviously moved. He holds the book up for the camera to see. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to me. Just like she promised. \nRight beneath the printed dedication For Henry Obert, Hannah has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah. \nHenry studies the book for a second. Snaps it shut. \n109   INT. KELLER OFFICE - DAY                                           109 \nLiterary agent David Keller being interviewed for the camera in his office. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS on his desk. David pulls one out. \nDAVID This is why I love LA. True story. This guy delivers a pizza to my house one night. Then the very next week, my wife has someone come in and clean the carpets. Guess what? Same guy. Small world, isn't it? So we get talking. He tells me his name's Henry. He's a writer. He's just finished a manuscript. Offers us a discount on the carpets if I'll read ten pages. I like that thinking. So I read ten pages. Wow. I want to read ten more. Before I know it, I've read the entire book. (MORE) \nDAVID (CONT'D) Just loved it. Fresh voice. Interesting characters. And that ending. \nDavid thumbs through the manuscript. \nDAVID (CONT'D) The washed-up, impotent novelist getting gunned down by Scott, the jealous, underemployed, pizza delivery man. This kid nailed it. It's on the page, know what I mean? So I intend to sign Mr. Henry Obert and get Pizza to Go out there. I predict a best seller. Probably a movie, too. I'll call him with the good news. Or maybe I'll just order a pizza. \n110   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       110 \nHenry taking down the rejection letters from his walls and packing them in a cardboard BOX. \nHENRY (V.O.) David Keller did call me. One week later, he sold Pizza to Go to a New York publisher. They decided to rename it A Slice of LA. I did it. I sold my novel. \nHenry puts the last of the rejection letters away. Finally, he picks up a FRAMED PHOTO. INSERT shows the six members of the writing group from happier times--the photo snapped in the restaurant. Full of hope and promise. \nHENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) I miss the Tuesday night group. They made me a better writer. They taught me how to handle rejection. \nHenry lingers on the photo before packing it away, as well. \n111   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                           111 \nMostly empty. Henry sits at a booth, alone, a new copy of Gatsby in his hands. He talks to the camera. CUP OF COFFEE in front of him. \nHENRY Hannah was right. The writing must always come first. Everything else waits. Everything. That's what I did finally. Finished my novel. (MORE) \nHENRY (CONT'D) Sold it. Now? Now I'm open. Ready for whatever-- \nWAITRESS stops by the table, refilling Henry's cup. Then setting the pot on the table, she reaches over and snatches the copy of Gatsby. \nSurprised, Henry glances up. \nHENRY (CONT'D) --happens next... \nIt's her again. That young waitress with purple streaks in her hair and matching purple glasses thumbs through the book. Henry finally checks out her name tag: Eudora. \nClutching the book, Eudora recites from memory: \nEUDORA Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-- \nHENRY (Surprised) --Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further... \nEudora nods. Henry is amazed. \nHENRY (CONT'D) You know Fitzgerald? \nEUDORA Not intimately. He died here, you know. \nHENRY December 21, 1940. \nEUDORA I go by there sometimes. \nHENRY The place on Hayworth. \n", "test3_true": "HENRY No. No. Not at all. \nEudora smiles, glad for the positive reinforcement. \nEUDORA OK. Good. Because, you know, I don't want people to think I'm weird. \nHENRY Of course not. Do you write? \nEUDORA Kinda, sort of. But I'm thinking of joining a writing group. \nHenry bites his tongue.   Eudora nods towards the camera. \nEUDORA (CONT'D) So what's this? Some kind of reality show, or something? \nHenry smiles. The two continue their idle chatter. \nCARD: EPILOGUE \n112   EXT.

Off to the side stands a GEEKY KID, gripping a FLIP PHONE aimed directly at William. William talks to our camera. \nWILLIAM C'mon. Admit it. You missed me. It wasn't as interesting once I left, right? \nHe winks.   The Kid doesn't move. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) I knew the group wouldn't last without me. No way. Losers. \nHe nods towards his companion. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Him? Oh. It's my new project. A reality TV show based on my life. You know...women I meet...thoughts that pop into my head. Kid follows me all around. 24/7. Actually I got the idea from you guys. Same concept-- just better characters. \nA question is asked. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Which network?

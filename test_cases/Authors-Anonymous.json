Favorite writer. Favorite writer... \nHannah goes blank. The smile disappears as her face goes into noticeable contortions. This is worse than Final Jeopardy. She turns quiet, squirming. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Favorite. Wow. Hard to say. I've studied Composition more than actual Literature. Gee. I know Maureen enjoys Jane... \nSearching for a last name, Hannah looks back to Maureen for help. \nMAUREEN Jane Austen. \nHANNAH That's the one. I hear she's good. But my favorite writer? Let me think about that a bit, OK? \nShort beat. Hannah lowers her voice, almost a loud confessional whisper. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) I didn't go to college. \n20   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                   20 \nJohn is holding court at his mobile home, showcasing the finest in furniture from Sears. John stuffs his home with various MILITARY ARTIFACTS--photos, equipment, books. He's got it all. John talks to the camera. \nJOHN Everything John K. Butzin knows about writing comes down to two simple words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom Clancy. The man's a genius. Does his research. All those nitty-gritty technical details. Now that's writing! John K. Butzin has one agent very interested in Roaring Lion. And a publisher up in Oxnard is looking at it as we speak. Plus a certain cousin's best friend has a neighbor who has an in with Clint Eastwood, so Hollywood might be calling soon. Don't know how the other members of the writing group will handle all this success by one person. They better not be pussies. \n21   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY              21 \nAlan and Colette remain on the couch. Talking to the camera. All smiles. Much more comfortable with the camera. \nALAN Well, I'm an optometrist in Glendale. \nCOLETTE And I write full-time. \nALAN Our last name's Mooney. You could call us Mooneys. We get that joke all the time. \nThe couple giggle at the joke. Forced. \nALAN (CONT'D) Which writer do I admire? Hmmm. How about John Grisham? Look at all that money he's made! Just teasing, John. We know you deserved every dime, but, hey, John, could you spread it around a bit, pal? \nCOLETTE Alan likes to tease. \nShe gives her husband an affectionate squeeze. \nALAN Colette, here, is the real writer. I'm more of an idea guy. I come up with great ideas, but don't always follow through. I'll show you. \nHe picks up his mini-digital Olympus RECORDER off the coffee table. Thinks for a second. \nALAN (CONT'D) (To recorder) Idea for romantic novel. \nAlan catches himself. \nALAN (CONT'D) No. Make that, idea for romantic ebook. \nHe winks at the camera--showing he's hip to the jargon. \nALAN (CONT'D) Possible movie option, too: Frovers. They couldn't be friends. They couldn't be lovers. So they became Frovers. \nSatisfied, Alan turns off the recorder. \n22   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       22 \nColette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a beautiful garden area. Quiet and private. Camera follows her over to a solitary BENCH. \nCOLETTE This is where I come for inspiration. I believe a writer must have quiet and solitude. I'll meditate. Write in my journal. Set out my creative path for the day. This is my Walden Pond. \nColette sits down on the bench. Takes in the environment. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Favorite author? I'd have to say Joan Didion. Her writing sends shivers down my spine. Though Joyce Carol Oates has been known to bring me to actual orgasm. \n23   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       23 \nColette sits on her bench, reading a BOOK. C.U. reveals that it is a novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Colette appears to be getting into the story just a bit too much. \n24   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                     24 \n", "test1_true": "25   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       25 \nBack to the present. Camera picks up a FRAMED PHOTO OF OPRAH from a corner of the bench. Holds it up for camera. \nCOLETTE Oh, this? I keep Oprah out here for luck. She's done so much to help writers. I know I'm going to be on her television show one day. I just know it. \nColette can already see the moment in her mind. Short beat. Then she looks off-camera--listening to someone. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) What? Oprah doesn't have a TV show anymore? Really? Since when? \nShort beat as she hears the answer. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) Oh... \nShort beat as she tries to cover. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) I knew that. I did. I-I knew. \n26   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                       26 \nHenry stands in front of his mirror. Checks his appearance. Again. Talks to the camera. \nHENRY Tonight's the night. I'm going to ask Hannah out. \nHenry becomes lost in thought.   Regroups. \nHENRY (CONT'D) It's time. I like her. She likes me-- I think. I've got to take action. Still stuck on Page 100. So I'm asking Hannah out on a date tonight. It'll be great. And I'll put this writer's block behind me. \nChecks his appearance one last time in the mirror. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Wish me luck. \n27   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                 27 \nAlan sits in his favorite chair, talking directly to the camera. \nALAN I'm the group leader. After all, getting together was my idea. They're all my patients. That's how we met. First one published gets a free eye exam. \nAlan cackles a bit too hard at that joke.    He listens to a question being asked. \nALAN (CONT'D) Why did I form the group? To help Colette. Oh, I certainly enjoy the creative process, but Colette? Writing is her dream. I'd do anything for her because...because she's my dream. So there you have it. \nAlan reaches for his tape recorder. \nALAN (CONT'D) Possible names for future characters. (MORE) \nALAN (CONT'D) Anthony Gilmore. No, wait. Make that Anthony T. Gilmore. Much better. Slate McCoy. Fletcher Peck. Fiona Foxx. And...a man known simply as Banjo. \nSatisfied, Alan turns off the recorder. \n28   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                        28 \nPlace is empty. Alan, Colette, William, John, and Henry gather around the center table. \nThe WRITERS AT WORK poster is propped up against a nearby empty chair. Hard not to notice the EMPTY CHAIR at the table. Hannah is missing. \nWaitress #1 pours coffee all around. Henry fidgets in his chair, focused on the empty chair. \nJOHN (To William) How come we never chow down at your place? \nWILLIAM This is my place. Close to the working people. \nJohn rolls his eyes. \nHENRY Where's Hannah? Anyone know? \nNobody responds. Alan checks his watch. \nALAN Time to get started. \nHENRY Shouldn't we wait for Hannah? \nWILLIAM Let's go, people. I'm ready to read. \n", "test1_id": 2955, "test2_input": "Dr. Xiroman places a comforting hand on her shoulder, trying to calm Colette down. \n78   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      78 \nSitting outside in the cheap lawn chairs with Sigrid, John addresses the camera. He cleans up pretty good. \nJOHN This is going to be a great day for John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First official book signing. \nSigrid holds up a copy of Roaring Lion. The dog on the cover has had an image of a lion slapped over it. Sigrid beams with pride. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Ready and raring to go. Of course, it would have been better to do this in an actual bookstore, but, hell, they're dropping faster than Charlie at Dak To. Not to worry. Since Sigrid works at the hardware store, they're going to let her favorite author sign a few books there. \nSIGRID More than a few books. Many, many books, Ja? \nJOHN Ja, my Strudel. Many books. \n79   EXT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          79 \nSIGNS in front window announcing hammers, ladders, paint on sale.

HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                          80 \nJohn sits at his card table in the corner. Alone. A stack of books sit piled in front of him. CUSTOMERS walk all around, ignoring John completely. John tries to stay relaxed, smiling and nodding at people, not being too forceful. \nSigrid, wearing her little red work vest and glasses, stands off to the side, beaming with pride. She hurries over to a cash register, takes the telephone out of her surprised boss' hand, and jumps on the store's PA SYSTEM, blasting throughout the store. \nSIGRID (On PA system) Attention shoppers. Famous author, Mr. John K. Bootzin, signing new best seller. Up front of store. John K. Bootzin. Also, special today in plumbing department. Ballcocks. Two for one. All customers guaranteed will be satisfied. Ja. \n81   INT. HARDWARE STORE -- DAY                                       81 \nThe PILE OF BOOKS seems untouched. \n82   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                        82 \nStill no takers.    Sigrid comes over to console him. \nJOHN Sorry, Strudel. Seem to be shooting blanks today. \nJohn looks past Sigrid. His face brightens. A smiling Alan has arrived, flanked by Colette, Henry and Hannah. Hannah holds a cupcake. Alan has a bottle of champagne and some plastic cups. But there is no touching, no direct interaction, between Colette and Alan. \nALAN Author!    Author! \nJohn stands up.    Clearly touched. \nJOHN Hey-Hey. The cavalry's arrived. Look who's here. \nSIGRID Hello, everyone! \nHANNAH Wouldn't miss your signing, John. \nHannah presents John with the cupcake and leans in for a friendly peck on the cheek. Colette aims her cell phone camera at John. \nCOLETTE Smile, John! \nJohn half-smiles in response. Henry reaches over and shakes his hand. \nHENRY Congratulations, John. \nJOHN Thanks, Obert. Where's the Bukowski wannabe? \nAwkward silence as the group members exchange puzzled looks. \nHANNAH William said he'd meet us here. \nJOHN What a turd.     Never liked that punk anyway. \nALAN Maybe he's still at our house. \nCOLETTE Maybe he is.     Maybe I should go see. \nALAN Maybe you should. \nWhat's that about? Henry studies John's book.       Flips to the back cover. Surprised. \nHENRY This is in Chinese. \n", "test2_true": "SIGRID International edition! \nJohn nods convincingly in agreement. \nALL (Except John and Sigrid) Oh... \n83   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                       83 \nSigrid sits alone on the couch as John floats in and out of camera, humming to himself, dancing like Fred Astaire. John is happy. Sigrid seems more subdued. Marked contrast. John addresses the camera. \nJOHN Know what the hardware store manager said? He said today was their most successful book signing. Ever. \nA question is asked.    John listens. \nJOHN (CONT'D) This was their first book signing? Oh. \nThink, John.   Think. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Well, John K. Butzin set the bar pretty high for the next writer, let me tell ya. That's right: 1-2-3-4-5- 6-7-8-9-10-11. Eleven books sold. \nSigrid clears her throat and flashes ten fingers in the air. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Oh, that's right, Strudel. You borrowed one at the store to help prop open the side door. I forgot. \nSIGRID Ja... \nJOHN Ten books. But there are now at least ten homes in California where folks have books by Melville. Hemingway. Clancy. And now Butzin. It's a humbling thought. \nJohn goes back to his routine. Sigrid offers up a supportive smile, but she doesn't seem quite as impressed. \n84   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT            84 \nAlan sits at the writers' table. Alone. Talks to the camera in whispered tones. \nALAN I've made an important decision as group leader. I've decided to ask William to leave the group. Now it has absolutely nothing to do with that incident at our house. It has nothing to do with the fact that I'm now sleeping in the guest room. But let's face it--the kid's a slacker. No contribution to the group. Zero. Zip. Nada. I'm sure he'll be fine with it. \n85   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT              85 \nWilliam kicks his CHAIR over. Alan, Colette, John, Henry and Hannah sit calmly around the table. Henry and Hannah apart. \nALAN There's no need to get so upset. \nWILLIAM Fine. I was going to quit anyway. Leave this bunch of losers. \nWilliam makes eye contact with Colette: You too? She looks away: Sorry. Only fuels William more. He points to Alan. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Christ. You and your stupid recorder. And your stupid ideas. And your stupid character names. \nWilliam clenches his fist and pretends it's a microphone. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Name for character. Bobby Blow Me. Gimme a break. \nAlan sits stone-faced.    William turns to John. \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) And G.I. Joe over here with that piece-of-crap, self-published tripe. Who are you kidding? \nFlustered, John starts to stand up.    Alan grabs John's arm, pulls him back down. \nALAN Just ignore him. \nWilliam continues on his rant with Colette. \nWILLIAM Colette, Colette, my pet. News Flash for you: Oprah's not calling--unless she needs a massage. Get real! \nJOHN Oprah?   She's not on TV anymore. \nCOLETTE I know that. \nWilliam turns his attention to Henry. \nWILLIAM The great Henry O. Man, you got the gift, bro'. But your head is up your ass over poor, sweet, successful Hannah here. \nHannah and Henry avoid looking at each other as William smiles at Hannah. \n", "test2_id": 2956, "test3_input": "HENRY Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know, the guy who just held up the line for five minutes talking to you? \nALAN (Over his shoulder) Ten. It was closer to ten minutes. \nHANNAH I don't know. We just talked. \nHENRY He sure liked you. \nHANNAH We just talked, Henry. I mentioned my book. He started asking about it. Writer to writer. No big deal. \nHENRY No big deal? Talking to Richard Benedict. No big deal! \nColette keeps walking. Biting her lip. Very quiet. \nALAN You gave him your phone number. \nHANNAH Look, a guy like that reads more books in a week than I ever have. Why would he bother call-- \nJust then, Hannah's iPhone goes off. She answers. The other three stop in their tracks. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) (On telephone) Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard. Hi. \nCOLETTE Unbelievable. \nHenry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back, creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her back on Henry. \nHANNAH (On telephone) Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know, Richard. I really appreciate the invitation, but-- \nShe listens. Her face is anguished. Finally -- \nHANNAH (CONT'D) This isn't a good time. Call me later. Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye. \nHannah turns off her phone. Alan, Colette, Henry stand there, gaping jaws wide open. \nALAN Amazing. \nCOLETTE This isn't fair. This just isn't fair. \nHANNAH What? \nCOLETTE First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie deal. \nALAN Please don't. \nCOLETTE No. This isn't fair. And now Richard Benedict wants to have coffee with you? All this is happening to you. And only you. Isn't there anything -- I don't know--some kind of cosmic creative crumb for the rest of us to nibble on? \nHANNAH I don't like what you're suggesting, Colette. You know how hard I work. How devoted I am. And I have been totally supportive of your writing. I've encouraged you all along. \nCOLETTE You wouldn't introduce me to your agent. \nHANNAH Brian didn't want to meet you. I asked. \nALAN Hannah has earned her success. \nCOLETTE Butt out Mr. Idea Man. \nALAN Hannah is a writer. She devotes herself one hundred percent to writing. Not one hundred percent to sleeping with writers. \nHenry steps in.    Finally. \nHENRY Why don't you two just go on ahead? \nCOLETTE It's not fair that she be the only one. \nHENRY Go. \nALAN C'mon.    Let's go. \nColette marches off in a huff; Alan in pursuit. She looks over her shoulder, shouting back at Hannah. \nCOLETTE \n90   EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY                                              90 \nHenry and Hannah sit on opposite ends of the bench.

I don't know. Somebody famous. Somebody with an agent. \nNow come the deep breaths.      More stress control. \nCOLETTE (CONT'D) I can't accomplish anything without an agent. They won't come to me.

Hannah takes a breath and finally breaks her silence. \nHANNAH Your writer's block? \nHENRY Yeah. \nHANNAH It's because your focus is always on everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald. Me. \nWhoa. Henry isn't about to argue. \nHANNAH (CONT'D) Listen to me, Henry Obert. Your writing must come first. Take this passion you have. Put it on the page. Forget everything else. All you're doing is wasting... \nHannah continues the lecture, speaking from the heart. \nHENRY (V.O.) She's right. But I know what's really happening here. Hannah's telling me she has every intention of talking to Richard Benedict. She has every intention of seeing him. \n93   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                         93 \nThere. On the discount table up by the cash register lies a pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade SIGN: 50% OFF! Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet contemplation. Heavy sigh. \nSigrid glances up. Her boss watches her from the cash register with a certain longing. He smiles. Sigrid returns the smile. \nBack to business. Sigrid pulls a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from her hip pocket. Counts quickly. Then picks up John's books, one by one. \n94   INT.

All the books sold at the hardware store? \nSIGRID Ja.   Every one. \nJohn claps his hands together. There is a certain spring in his feet. \nJOHN Didn't I tell you, Strudel?   Write it and they will read. \nJohn can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile home, his mind racing. Sigrid is more composed. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Get some more copies down there. Maybe do another signing. Yeah. No. Time for a real tour. Fresno. Bakersfield. Stockton. Call a few bookstores. Let 'em know John K. Butzin is coming. Lock and load. \nAnd he's off, leaving the frame, already planning his big adventure, leaving Sigrid alone. \nFacing the camera, she nods slightly. Then offers us a small wave. \nSIGRID Bye.

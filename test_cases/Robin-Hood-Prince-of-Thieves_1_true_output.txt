INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the altar. NOTTINGHAM What can your puny God do for you now? The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked. Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand. He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the temple.  The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries to squirm away. ROBIN This is for my father. 
He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still. Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside. Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on the edge of the steep parapet. 
EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes out. A spitfire. MARIAN Let me go!   Who are you? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN (restraining her) I'm your sworn protector.   Any way I see fit. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder, Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into the freezing water. She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back. Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers, enjoying the show. MARIAN Robin?   Oh God, is that you? She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him, pounding her fists on his chest. MARIAN How dare you?! Robin grins at the crowd. ROBIN I think she's feeling better. Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against Robin's chest. Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and Fanny. LITTLE JOHN We done it, mate. We clobbered the buggers. FANNY Are you 'urt? ROBIN It will mend. He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's head. ROBIN Aslan, my friend. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ASLAN I'm going home the easy way, Robin. FRIAR (shaking Aslan) You die on me, you son of satan, and I swear I'll bury you as a Christian in St. Catherine's Cathedral with a thousand monks chanting prayers for your miserable soul. You hear me? ASLAN (weakly) I have no strength, Brother Tuck. FRIAR (kicking him) A fine friend you are! By the grace of Allah and Jehovah we have won the day, and you want to give up the ghost. I'll pickle your remains in mead, lay you in your grave with a pig for a companion, and mark it with a cross as big as this castle. ASLAN Please!   It hurts when I laugh. FRIAR See. There's life in the heathen dog yet. ROBIN (laughs) Here, Tuck. Look after him.    You deserve each other. Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering grows, till the whole crowd is in unison. CROWD Robin Hood!   Robin Hood! DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY A VOICE ECHOES from the vaulted roof.   A wedding is in progress. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: FRIAR (O.S.) By the power vested in me by God's holy church, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple. FRIAR You may kiss the bride. The husband draws back the bride's veil.    Robin and Marian. They kiss... long. FRIAR (whispers) Hurry. We waste good celebration time. They break   the embrace, turn to the congregation and start down   the aisle. They pause at the front pew, where KING   RICHARD and members of his court are sitting. Robin bows,   Marian curtsies. KING RICHARD May I kiss the bride? ROBIN Who would dare refuse his king's request? KING RICHARD (kissing Marian's cheek) You look radiant, cousin. ROBIN We are deeply honored by Your Majesty's presence. KING RICHARD It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley. Thanks to you I still have a throne. They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre- gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin embrace. ASLAN (whispers) My friend, a word of advice... Ride her better than your horse. Robin laughs. 
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY WEDDING BELLS PEAL. Robin and Marian step out into the sunlight. The crowd cheers. At a signal from Little John, the ex-outlaws shoot flaming arrows into the sky... FIREWORKS...

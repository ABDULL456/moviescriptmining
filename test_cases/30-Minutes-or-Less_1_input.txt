SECURITY GUARD Just take it easy, man! 
WILL Don't be a hero, cowboy! 
SECURITY GUARD What the fuck does that mean? I'm not a hero! Or a cowboy! 
As people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one ANOTHER - 
Chet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass partition. 
CHET All of you, back away from the counter and get out here! Anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot! 
The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get onto their stomachs. 
Will looks to the Guard. 
WILL Very slowly, take out your gun and toss it away. 
The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and - 
Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s), whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform. 
MOM Oh, god! I don't want the gun! 
WILL (TO GUARD) What the fuck!? Did you do that on purpose!? 
SECURITY GUARD It was an accident! 
CHET Are you guys working together? 
MOM No! Please take this gun away! 
WILL Just toss it, lady! 
The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and 
BLAM! 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Ah! 
A FAT MAN has been shot. He clutches his thigh. 
FAT MAN I think she got the femoral artery! 
MOM I'm sorry! It was an accident! 
FAT MAN Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!? 
DAUGHTER Mommy, what's happening!? 
MOM Christi, be quiet. These men are dangerous. 
Chet turns ashen. He moves close to Will, whispers urgently - 
CHET This is fucked. That dude is gonna bleed out and we're gonna go to prison. 
WILL Just calm down. 
FAT MAN Why is no one getting me help!? 
WILL Is anyone here a doctor? 
Nothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people. 
Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging his leg. 
WILL Sir, let me see where you're hit. 
FAT MAN Just call me an ambulance! 
WILL Calm down, sir. 
The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of blood. 
WILL It's just a flesh wound. You're gonna be okay. 
FAT MAN But it hurts so bad. 
WILL You got shot, man. It's not supposed to feel good. But you're gonna be fine. And you'll have a great story to tell everyone.

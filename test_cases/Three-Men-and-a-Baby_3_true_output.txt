MICHAEL Coochie, coochie, coo... woo, woo, woo... bippity, boppity boo... Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's. Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as though he were just coming out of his room. PETER Hi, Michael, I just came back to get a file I forgot... 
Michael stops his baby-talk immediately, as though sud- denly paralyzed, embarrassed, guilty. Peter enters the room. PETER Everything okay? MICHAEL (without looking at him) Yeah, okay. Silence. PETER (not moving) Well, I guess I'll be going now. MICHAEL (not moving either) Yeah... They're both uneasy. PETER The baby okay? MICHAEL (not budging an inch) Yeah, okay. Peter exits. 
108   INT. BATHROOM - EVENING                                108 Peter enters the bathroom. He's carrying Mary, who's naked and wrapped in a towel. 
Peter carefully locks the door behind him. He removes Mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled with warm water. Mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water. Peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water on her shoulders and head. The water streams down her face. She blinks and laughs. Peter whispers lovingly to her in a barely audible, very low voice. Mary stares at him. FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
109   SAME SCENE - MONTHS LATER                                109 Peter is wearing a different suit and Mary is almost one-year-old, with a lot more hair on her head, and able to sit up a lot better. 
110   INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 110 Although it is dark, we can distinguish in Jack's bed a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping... Suddenly, from the direction of    the living room, we can hear MARY CRYING. Jack emerges     from under the comforter and switches on the light: he     has a female guest in his bed, a pretty BRUNETTE this    time. JACK (to himself) Shit, she's crying... BRUNETTE What? JACK Nothing, nothing. I'll be right back. He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. He goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers her with kisses. Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. Jack rocks her for a moment then puts her back to bed. Mary instantly starts crying again. Jack very quickly picks her up again and kisses her. Mary is delighted by his tenderness. Jack puts her back to bed again. 
Mary cries again. JACK It' beddy-bye time now, honey, beddy-bye, don't cry, sweetheart... 
Mary keeps crying, Jack picks her up again. Peter and Michael in their pajamas, their faces swollen with sleep, enter the living room. PETER (in a soft voice) She's crying. JACK (hushed voice) Yeah, every time I try to put her back to bed... MICHAEL (hushed voice) Maybe she's thirsty? PETER No, her back teeth must be starting to bother her... JACK What should I do? MICHAEL I've bought some stuff for her gums. He rubs some of the medication on Mary's gums. PETER Try and put her back to bed; we'll sing. Jack puts Mary back to bed. Michael, as a routine, sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes. They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony, as they lean over the crib. Mary is in seventh heaven. She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her thumb.

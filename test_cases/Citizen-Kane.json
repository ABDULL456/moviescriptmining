{"train": "CITIZEN KANE \nCitizen Kane \nBy \nHerman J. Mankiewicz \nOrson Welles \nPROLOGUE \nFADE IN: \nEXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE) \nWindow, very small in the distance, illuminated. \nAll around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it - a huge initial \"K\" showing darker and darker against the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness. \nDISSOLVE: \nA SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL TELLING SOMETHING OF: \nThe literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE. \nIts right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good- sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain. \nDISSOLVE: \nGOLF LINKS (MINIATURE) \nPast which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nWHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE) \nOf the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.) \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE) \nIn the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE) \nThe idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - the lighted window. \nTHE LAGOON (MINIATURE) \nThe boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer.\"  As it moves across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the window in the castle, closer than before. \nTHE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE) \nIt is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE COTTAGES (MINIATURE) \nIn the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nA DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE) \nOver a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last King died. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE WINDOW (MINIATURE) \nCamera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - \nA very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against the enormous window. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE. \nAn incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to Indian Temple bells - the music freezes - \nKANE'S OLD OLD VOICE Rosebud... \nShot of early tintype stills of Thomas Foster Kane and his wife, Mary, on their wedding day.  A similar picture of Mary Kane some four or five years later with her little boy, Charles Foster Kane. \nNARRATOR Fifty-seven years later, before a Congressional Investigation, Walter P.  Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street, for years chief target of Kane papers' attack on \"trusts,\" recalls a journey he made as a youth... \nShot of Capitol, in Washington D.C. \nShot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of existing J.P. Morgan newsreel).  This runs silent under narration.  Walter P. Thatcher is on the stand.  He is flanked by his son, Walter P. Thatcher Jr., and other partners.  He is being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen.  At this moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, causing considerable confusion and embarrassment. \nNewsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now fades in. \nTHATCHER ...  because of that trivial incident... \nINVESTIGATOR It is a fact, however, is it not, that in 1870, you did go to Colorado? \nTHATCHER I did. \nINVESTIGATOR In connection with the Kane affairs? \nTHATCHER Yes.  My firm had been appointed trustees by Mrs. Kane for the fortune, which she had recently acquired.  It was her wish that I should take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane. \nNARRATOR That same month in Union Square - \nINVESTIGATOR Is it not a fact that on that occasion, the boy personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled? \nLoud laughter and confusion. \nTHATCHER Mr. Chairman, I will read to this committee a prepared statement I have brought with me - and I will then refuse to answer any further questions.  Mr.  Johnson, please! \nA young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase. \nTHATCHER (reading it) \"With full awareness of the meaning of my words and the responsibility of what I am about to say, it is my considered belief that Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner in which he has persistently attacked the American traditions of private property, initiative and opportunity for advancement, is - in fact - nothing more or less than a Communist.\" \nNewsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying banners urging the boycott of Kane papers.  A speaker is on the platform above the crowd. \nSPEAKER (fading in on soundtrack) - till the words \"Charles Foster Kane\" are a menace to every working man in this land.  He is today what he has always been and always will be - A FASCIST! \nNARRATOR And yet another opinion - Kane's own. \nSilent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of the magnificent Enquirer building.  On platform, in full ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane.  He orates silently. \nTITLE: \n\"I AM, HAVE BEEN, AND WILL BE ONLY ONE THING - AN AMERICAN.\" CHARLES FOSTER KANE. \nSame locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame. \nAnother newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his second wife in a nightclub.  He looks lonely and unhappy in the midst of the gaiety. \nNARRATOR Twice married, twice divorced - first to a president's niece, Emily Norton - today, by her second marriage, chatelaine of the oldest of England's stately homes.  Sixteen years after that - two weeks after his divorce from Emily Norton - Kane married Susan Alexander, singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey. \nTITLE: \nFEW PRIVATE LIVES WERE MORE PUBLIC. \nPeriod still of Emily Norton (1900). \nDISSOLVE: \nReconstructed silent newsreel.  Kane, Susan, and Bernstein emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press photographers, reporters, etc.  Kane looks startled, recoils for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit. \nNARRATOR For wife two, one-time opera singing Susan Alexander, Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House. Cost: three million dollars. Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him, the still unfinished Xanadu. Cost: no man can say. \nStill of architect's sketch with typically glorified \"rendering\" of the Chicago Municipal Opera House. \nDISSOLVE: \nA glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent fairy-tale estate built on a mountain. (1920) \nThen shots of its preparation. (1917) \nShots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by with tremendous noise. \nShots of vast dredges, steamshovels. \nShot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters. \nIn quick succession, shots follow each other, some reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc. \nNARRATOR One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble, are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain. Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle - two of each; the biggest private zoo since Noah.  Contents of Kane's palace: paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace, shipped to Florida from every corner of the earth, from other Kane houses, warehouses, where they mouldered for years. Enough for ten museums - the loot of the world. \nMore shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a large mountain - at different periods in its development - rising out of the sands. \nShots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc. being herded, unloaded, shipped, etc. in various ways. \nShots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, Arabian, Chinese, etc.) but all consigned to Charles Foster Kane, Xanadu, Florida. \nA reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace.  A group of persons in clothes of the period of 1917.  In their midst, clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan. \nNARRATOR Kane urged his country's entry into one war, opposed participation in another.  Swung the election to one American President at least, was called another's assassin. Thus, Kane's papers might never have survived - had not the President. \nTITLE: \nFROM XANADU, FOR THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, ALL KANE ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED, MANY OF THE NATIONS DESTINIES SHAPED. \nShots of various authentically worded headlines of American papers since 1895. \nSOMEBODY'S VOICE Motivation - \nRAWLSTON That's it - motivation.  What made Kane what he was?  And, for that matter, what was he?  What we've just seen are the outlines of a career - what's behind the career? What's the man?  Was he good or bad?  Strong or foolish?  Tragic or silly?  Why did he do all those things?  What was he after? (then, appreciating his point) Maybe he told us on his death bed. \nTHOMPSON Yes, and maybe he didn't. \nRAWLSTON Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it. \nTHOMPSON I know, but - \nRAWLSTON (riding over him like any other producer) All we saw on that screen was a big American - \nA VOICE One of the biggest. \nRAWLSTON (without pausing for this) But how is he different from Ford? Or Hearst for that matter?  Or Rockefeller - or John Doe? \nA VOICE I know people worked for Kane will tell you - not only in the newspaper business - look how he raised salaries.  You don't want to forget - \nANOTHER VOICE You take his labor record alone, they ought to hang him up like a dog. \nRAWLSTON I tell you, Thompson - a man's dying words - \nSOMEBODY'S VOICE What were they? \nSilence. \nSOMEBODY'S VOICE (hesitant) Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's dying words? \nRAWLSTON (with disgust) Rosebud! \nA little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced by Rawlston. \nRAWLSTON That's right. \nA VOICE Tough guy, huh? (derisively) Dies calling for Rosebud! \nRAWLSTON Here's a man who might have been President.  He's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time - but when he comes to die, he's got something on his mind called \"Rosebud.\" What does that mean? \nANOTHER VOICE A racehorse he bet on once, probably, that didn't come in - Rosebud! \nRAWLSTON All right.  But what was the race? \nThere is a short silence. \nRAWLSTON Thompson! \nTHOMPSON Yes, sir. \nRAWLSTON Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to... \nTHOMPSON (feebly) But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days it might be better than if - \nRAWLSTON (decisively) Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - (pauses) I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course - \nThe Third Man gives a hearty \"yes-man\" laugh. \nTHOMPSON I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston. \nRAWLSTON (rising) Good! \nThe camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's picture on the screen. \nRAWLSTON'S VOICE It'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing... \nFADE OUT: \nNOTE:  Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for the facts about Kane - his researches ... his interviews with the people who knew Kane. \nIt is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is Thompson himself a personality.  Until then, throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice. He is not until the final scene a \"character\".  He is the personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster Kane.  He is the investigator. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CHEAP CABARET - \"EL RANCHO\" - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT - 1940 (MINIATURE) - RAIN \nThe first image to register is a sign: \n\"EL RANCHO\" \nFLOOR SHOW \nSUSAN ALEXANDER KANE \nTWICE NIGHTLY \nThese words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at the end of the fade out.  Then there is lightning which reveals a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands.  Thunder again, and faintly the sound of music from within.  A light glows from a skylight.  The camera moves to this and closes in. Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down into the interior of the cabaret.  Directly below us at a table sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. \"EL RANCO\" CABARET - NIGHT - \nMedium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink she started to take above.  It is Susie.  The music, of course, is now very loud.  Thompson, his back to the camera, moves into the picture in the close foreground.  A Captain appears behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson. \nTHE CAPTAIN (a Greek) This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander. \nSusan looks up into Thompson's face.  She is fifty, trying to look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously generous evening dress.  Blinking up into Thompson's face, she throws a crink into ther mouth.  Her eyes, which she thinks is keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery. \nManuscript, neatly and precisely written: \n\"CHARLES FOSTER KANE \nWHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY.  A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE, WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD...  THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE.  IN THE WINTER OF 1870...\" \nThe camera has not held on the entire page.  It has been following the words with the same action that the eye does the reading.  On the last words, the white page of the paper \nDISSOLVES INTO: \nEXT. MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - \nThe white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a parlor window. \nIn the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like an animated cartoon).  He is in the act of throwing a snowball at the camera.  It sails toward us and over our heads, out of scene. \nReverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading: \nMRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE \nHIGH CLASS MEALS AND LODGING \nINQUIRE WITHIN \nCharles Kane's snowball hits the sign. \nINT. PARLOR - MRS. KANE'S BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY - \nCamera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is not cut into scene.  We see only the field of snow again, same angle as in previous scene.  Charles is manufacturing another snowball.  Now - \nCamera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse.  Mrs. Kane, aged about 28, is looking out towards her son.  Just as we take her in she speaks: \nMRS. KANE (calling out) Be careful, Charles! \nTHATCHER'S VOICE Mrs. Kane - \nMRS. KANE (Calling out the window almost on top of this) Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles - \nBut Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to this and is running away.  Mrs. Kane turns into camera and we see her face - a strong face, worn and kind. \nTHATCHER'S VOICE think we'll have to tell him now - \nCamera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing multiplicity of official-looking documents.  He is 26 and, as might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado. \nMRS. KANE I'll sign those papers - \nKANE SR. You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father. \nAt the sound of Kane Sr.'s voice, both have turned to him and the camera pulls back still further, taking him in. \nKane Sr., who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever since daybreak. \nFrom outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow. \nMRS. KANE It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher - \nKANE SR. If I want to, I can go to court. father has a right to - \nTHATCHER (annoyed) Mr. Kane, the certificates that Mr.  Graves left here are made out to Mrs.  Kane, in her name.  Hers to do with as she pleases - \nKANE SR. Well, I don't hold with signing my boy away to any bank as guardian just because - \nMRS. KANE (quietly) I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim. \nTHATCHER The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. (clears his throat) \nKANE SR. The idea of a bank being the guardian - \nMrs. Kane has met his eye.  Her triumph over him finds expression in his failure to finish his sentence. \nMRS. KANE (even more quietly) I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim. \nTHATCHER We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner. \nKane Sr. opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, but chokes down his opinion. \nMRS. KANE (has been reading past Thatcher's shoulder as he talked) Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher? \nTHATCHER Right here, Mrs. Kane. \nKANE SR. (sulkily) Don't say I didn't warn you. \nMrs. Kane lifts the quill pen. \nKANE SR. Mary, I'm asking you for the last time - anyon'd think I hadn't been a good husband and a - \nMrs. Kane looks at him slowly.  He stops his speech. \nTHATCHER The sum of fifty thousand dollars a year is to be paid to yourself and Mr. Kane as long as you both live, and thereafter the survivor - \nMrs. Kane puts pen to the paper and signs. \nKANE SR. Well, let's hope it's all for the best. \nMRS. KANE It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher - \nTHATCHER Come on, Charles.  Let's shake hands. (extends his hand. Charles continues to look at him) Now, now!  I'm not as frightening as all that!  Let's shake, what do you say? \nHe reaches out for Charles's hand.  Without a word, Charles hits him in the stomach with the sled.  Thatcher stumbles back a few feet, gasping. \nTHATCHER (with a sickly grin) You almost hurt me, Charles. (moves towards him) Sleds aren't to hit people with. Sleds are to - to sleigh on.  When we get to New York, Charles, we'll get you a sled that will - \nHe's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder.  As he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle. \nMRS. KANE Charles! \nHe throws himself on her, his arms around her.  Slowly Mrs. Kane puts her arms around him. \nKANE (frightened) Mom!  Mom! \nMRS. KANE It's all right, Charles, it's all right. \nThatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over to rub his ankle. \nKANE SR. Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing! \nMRS. KANE That's what you think, is it, Jim? \nKANE SR. Yes. \nMrs. Kane looks slowly at Mr. Kane. \nMRS. KANE (slowly) That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him. \nDISSOLVE: \n1870 - NIGHT (STOCK OR MINIATURE) \nOld-fashioned railroad wheels underneath a sleeper, spinning along the track. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. TRAIN - OLD-FASHIONED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT - \nThatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing alongside a berth, looking at Kane.  Kane, his face in the pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs. \nKANE Mom!  Mom! \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nThe white page of the Thatcher manuscript.  We pick up the words: \n\"HE WAS, I REPEAT, A COMMON ADVENTURER, SPOILED, UNSCRUPULOUS, IRRESPONSIBLE.\" \nThe words are followed by printed headline on \"Enquirer\" copy (as in following scene). \nINT. ENQUIRER CITY ROOM - DAY - \nClose-up on printed headline which reads: \n\"ENEMY ARMADA OFF JERSEY COAST\" \nCamera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the \"Enquirer\" copy, on which we read the headline.  He is standing near the editorial round table around which a section of the staff, including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch. \nTHATCHER (coldly) Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper? \nKANE I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of. \nTHATCHER (reading headline of paper he is still holding) \"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast.\" You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast. \nKANE Can you prove it isn't? \nBernstein has come into the picture.  He has a cable in his hand.  He stops when he sees Thatcher. \nKANE Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher - \nBERNSTEIN How are you, Mr. Thatcher? \nTHATCHER How do you do? - \nBERNSTEIN We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr. Kane - (stops, embarrassed) \nKANE That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr.  Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge.  What's the cable? \nBERNSTEIN (reading) The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler. \nTHATCHER You see!  There hasn't been a true word - \nKANE I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see - (snaps his fingers) Mike! \nMIKE (a fairly tough customer prepares to take dictation, his mouth still full of food) Go ahead, Mr. Kane. \nKANE Dear Wheeler - (pauses a moment) You provide the prose poems - I'll provide the war. \nLaughter from the boys and girls at the table. \nBERNSTEIN That's fine, Mr. Kane. \nKANE I rather like it myself.  Send it right away. \nMIKE Right away. \nTHOMPSON You know why?  She was so - \nBERNSTEIN Sure, sure. \nTHOMPSON I'm going back there. \nBERNSTEIN Who else did you see? \nTHOMPSON Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his - \nBERNSTEIN Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met - \nTHOMPSON He made an awful lot of money. \nBERNSTEIN It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. (his eyes get reflective) Thatcher! \nBernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming to see something as he talks. \nBERNSTEIN He never knew there was anything in the world but money.  That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays! (reflectively) The time he came to Rome for Mr. Kane's twenty-fifth birthday... You know, when Mr. Kane got control of his own money...  Such a fool like Thatcher - I tell you, nobody's business! \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY - \nBernstein speaking to Thompson. \nBERNSTEIN He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane did, and he got it!  Thatcher never did figure him out.  He was hard to figure sometimes, even for me. Mr. Kane was a genius like he said. He had that funny sense of humor. Sometimes even I didn't get the joke.  Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago... You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer... (indicates with a little wave of his hand what he thinks of that; sighing) That was years later, of course - 1914 it was.  Mrs. Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible.  But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics.  Mr. Kane was a big man in those days.  But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland - \nHe leaves the sentence up in the air, as we \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CITY ROOM - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - \nIt is late.  The room is almost empty.  Nobody is at work at the desks.  Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with overcoats and hats.  Eveybody is tense and expectant. \nCITY EDITOR (turns to a young hireling; quietly) What about Branford Leland?  Has he got in his copy? \nHIRELING Not yet. \nBERNSTEIN Go in and ask him to hurry. \nCITY EDITOR Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland. \nBERNSTEIN (looks at him for a moment; then slowly) I might make him nervous. \nCITY EDITOR (after a pause) You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand. \nBERNSTEIN (with a smile) That's right.  They called us the \"Three Musketeers.\" \nSomebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter. The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation. \nCITY EDITOR He's a great guy - Leland. (another little pause) Why'd he ever leave New York? \nBERNSTEIN (he isn't saying) That's a long story. \nANOTHER HIRELING (a tactless one) Wasn't there some sort of quarrel between - \nBERNSTEIN (quickly) I had nothing to do with it. (then, somberly) It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly.  Better we should forget such things - (turning to City Editor) Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle? \nCITY EDITOR Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course. \nBERNSTEIN And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in? \nCITY EDITOR Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review. \nBERNSTEIN Enthusiastic? \nCITY EDITOR Yes, very! (quietly) Naturally. \nBERNSTEIN Well, well - isn't that nice? \nKANE'S VOICE Mr. Bernstein - \nBernstein turns. \nMedium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout. He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded opera hat. \nBERNSTEIN Hello, Mr. Kane. \nThe Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side.  Widespread, half-suppressed sensation. \nCITY EDITOR Mr. Kane, this is a surprise! \nKANE We've got a nice plant here. \nEverybody falls silent.  There isn't anything to say. \nKANE Was the show covered by every department? \nCITY EDITOR Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures. \nKANE (very, very casually) And the notice? \nTHOMPSON (after a pause) I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway. \nBERNSTEIN (looks at him very soberly) He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson.  He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie - \nTHOMPSON Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her. \nBERNSTEIN Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man.  You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer. \nOn these last words, we \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY - \nThe front half of the second floor constitutes one large City Room.  Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of it is actually getting into the room because the windows are small and narrow.  There are about a dozen tables and desks, of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters. Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, obviously serve the city room executives.  To the left of the platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum. \nAs Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new arrivals.  Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises and starts toward them. \nCARTER Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the \"Enquirer.\"  I am Herbert Carter. \nKANE Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland. \nCARTER (bowing) How do you do, Mr. Leland? \nKANE (pointing to the standing reporters) Are they standing for me? \nCARTER I thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher - \nKANE (grinning) Ask them to sit down. \nCARTER You may resume your work, gentlemen. (to Kane) I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations. \nKANE I don't my plans myself. \nThey are following Carter to his raised platform. \nKANE As a matter of fact, I haven't got any.  Except to get out a newspaper. \nThere is a terrific crash at the doorway.  They all turn to see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance.  A roll of bedding, a suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him. \nKANE Oh, Mr. Bernstein! \nBernstein looks up. \nKANE If you would come here a moment, please, Mr. Bernstein? \nBernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes. \nKANE Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager. \nCARTER (frigidly) How do you do, Mr. Bernstein? \nKANE You've got a private office here, haven't you? \nThe delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance with parts of the bedstead and other furniture.  He is looking about, a bit bewildered. \nCARTER (indicating open door to left of platform) My little sanctum is at your disposal.  But I don't think I understand - \nKANE I'm going to live right here. (reflectively) As long as I have to. \nCARTER But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices - \nKANE That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY - \nKane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal at the same time.  Carter, still formally coated, is seated alongside him.  Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, detached, amused.  The furniture has been pushed around and Kane's effects are somewhat in place.  On a corner of the desk, Bernstein is writing down figures.  No one pays any attention to him. \nKANE I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the \"Chronicle,\" (points to it) and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered. (looks to make sure of the name) A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the \"Enquirer\" have that this morning? \nCARTER (stiffly) Because we're running a newspaper, Mr.  Kane, not a scandal sheet. \nKane has finished eating.  He pushes away his plates. \nKANE I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. (pointing to the \"Chronicle\" before him) The \"Chronicle\" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we? \nCARTER There is no news big enough. \nKANE If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone - \nCARTER (hotly) As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. (triumphantly) Our man even arrived before the \"Chronicle\" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead. \nKANE (smiling a bit) The \"Chronicle\" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious. \nCARTER (stiffly) It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily - \nKANE (gently) That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr.  Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the \"Enquirer\" will have him arrested. (he gets an idea) Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. \nLoudly, so that the neighbors can hear. \nCARTER Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper - \nKane isn't listening to him. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN - \nThe newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter but very insistent. \nKane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the Enquirer building. \nKane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair. \nNEWSBOYS' VOICES CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE! \nKane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, are very much fainter after this. \nLELAND We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes. \nBERNSTEIN (looking at his watch) It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it - \nLeland rises from the chair, stretching painfully. \nKANE Tired? \nLELAND It's been a tough day. \nKANE A wasted day. \nBERNSTEIN (looking up) Wasted? \nLELAND (incredulously) Charlie?! \nBERNSTEIN You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all - \nKANE I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the \"New York Enquirer\" as important to New York as the gas in that light. \nLELAND (quietly) What're you going to do, Charlie? \nKane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy concentration. \nKANE My Declaration of Principles - (he says it with quotes around it) Don't smile, Brad - (getting the idea) Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein - \nBERNSTEIN Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane - \nKANE I'll write it myself. \nKane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon.  Sitting down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write. \nBERNSTEIN (looking over his shoulder) You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep. \nKANE (as he writes) These'll be kept. (stops for a minute and reads what he has written; reading) I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. (starts to write again; reading as he writes) will also provide them - \nLELAND That's the second sentence you've started with \"I\" - \nKANE (looking up) People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. (he speaks with real conviction) And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news. \nHe looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, reading as he writes. \nBernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane.  They both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side. Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette. Bernstein is still smoking a cigar. \nDISSOLVE: \nFront page of the \"Enquirer\" shows big boxed editorial with heading: \nMY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE \nCamera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six piles and go on back until we see a big field of \"Enquirers\" - piles of \"Enquirers\" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution. \nA wagon with a huge sign on its side reading \n\"ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000\" \npasses through foreground, and we wipe to: \nA pile of \"Enquirers\" for sale on a broken down wooden box on a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins fall on the pile. \nThe stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front wheel.  A copy of the \"Enquirer\" is tossed on the stoop. \nA breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the \"Enquirer\". Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the front page. \nThe wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, there is tossed a bound bundle of the \"New York Enquirer\" - the Declaration of Principles still prominent. \nRural Delivery - a copy of the \"Enquirer\"s being put into bins, showing state distribution. \nThe railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images. On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles of the \"Enquirer\" are larger.  On the first image, we move in to hold on the words \"CIRCULATION - 31,000.\"  We are this close for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased. \nThe entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train. \nThe last figure \"62,000\" opposite the word \"CIRCULATION\" on the \"Enquirer\" masthead changes to: \nEXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY - \nAngle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting the last zero to the figure \"62,000\" on an enormous sign advertising the \"Enquirer.\"  It reads: \nTHE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000 \nCamera travels down side of building - takes in another building on which there is a sign which reads: \nINT. ENQUIRER OFFICE \nCartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of \"Johnny the Monk.\" \nDISSOLVE: \nFloor of room -  Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, looking at the same comic strip. \nKane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the period.  A sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane is arranging her dress to look more seductive. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nThe hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering almost half a page of the \"Enquirer.\"  It is being read in a barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man who is reading it.  He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a haircut.  The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: \"I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING, SAYS DANCER.  EVERYTHING WENT RED.\"  An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay- out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: \"DEATH GUN.\" \nSTREET - SHOT OF BUCKET BRIGADE \nShot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, grabbing camera from photographer.  Before him rages a terrific tenement fire. \nDISSOLVE: \nINSERT:  Headline about inadequacy of present fire equipment. \nDISSOLVE: \nFinal shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a street corner (Stock). \nDISSOLVE: \nA black pattern of iron bars.  We are in a prison cell.  The door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob- sister, and Kane.  The photographers take pictures with a mighty flash of old-fashioned flash powder.  The condemned man in the foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this. \nDISSOLVE: \nA copy of the \"Enquirer\" spread out on a table.  A big lay-out of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock shot) with a headline indicating that the \"Enquirer\" has won its campaign for better equipment.  A cup of coffee and a doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee. \nThe Beaux Art Ball.  A number of elderly swells are jammed into a hallway.  Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress costume, pink fleshings, etc., the effect to be very surprising, very lavish and very very ridiculous.  We see, among others, Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of the \"New York Enquirer.\" \nOver the \"Enquirer\"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a pretty repulsive sight. \nThe whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can. \nExtreme close-up of the words: \"OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST.\" \nCamera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality. Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport. \nEXT. CUNARD DOCKS - GANGPLANK AND DECK OF BOAT - NIGHT - \nAs camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner.  Behind the principles can be seen an enormous plain sign which reads: \"FIRST CLASS.\"  From offstage can be heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury production, the old familiar cry, \"All Ashore That's Going Ashore!\" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the rest of it. \nTHE OFFICIAL There you are, Mr. Kane.  Everything in order. \nKANE Thank you. \nKane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank. \nTHE OFFICIAL (calling) Have a good rest, Mr. Kane. \nKANE Thanks. \nBERNSTEIN But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff - \nKANE I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers - \nSTEWARD'S VOICE All ashore! \nKANE - and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections. \nSTEWARD'S VOICE All ashore that's going ashore! \nKane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he rushes up to it, calling back with a wave: \nKANE Goodbye, gents! (at the top of the gangplank, he turns and calls down) Hey! \nKANE (calling down to them) You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you? \nA band on deck strikes up \"Auld Lang Syne.\"  Bernstein and Leland turn to each other. \nBERNSTEIN Do you, Mr. Leland? \nLELAND (smiling) Certainly not. \nThey start down the gangplank together. \nDISSOLVE: \nLONG SHOT OF THE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads \"THE NEW YORK DAILY ENQUIRER.\"  A couple of lights show in the building.  We start toward the window where the lights show, as we - \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT \nThe light in the window in the former shot was showing behind the letter \"E\" of the Enquirer sign.  Now the letter \"E\" is even larger than the frame of the camera.  Rain drips disconsolately off the middle part of the figure.  We see through this and through the drizzle of the window to Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded light. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - DAY - \nBernstein and Thompson.  As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's voice is heard. \nBERNSTEIN The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud! \nTHOMPSON It didn't end very well, did it? \nBERNSTEIN (shaking his head) It ended - (a slight pause) Then there was Susie - that ended, too. (shrugs, a pause; then looking up into Thompson's eyes) guess he didn't make her very happy - \n(A PAUSE) You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about - \nTHOMPSON Yes - \nBERNSTEIN Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - (a pause) You ought to talk to Bradford Leland.  He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead. \nTHOMPSON In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street. \nBERNSTEIN You don't say!  Why I had no idea - \nTHOMPSON Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - (controls himself) \nBERNSTEIN Just old age. (smiles sadly) It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. (pauses) You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY - \nClose shot - Thompson.  He is tilted back in a chair which seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney.  Leland's voice is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen. \nLELAND'S VOICE When you get to my age, young man, you don't miss anything.  Unless maybe it's a good drink of bourbon. Even that doesn't make much difference, if you remember there hasn't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years. \nCamera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to Thompson.  They are on the flat roof of a hospital.  Other people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along with a nurse or two.  They are all sunning themselves. \nTHOMPSON Mr. Leland, you were - \nLELAND You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I? Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness.  But he kept it to himself. (grinning) He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something. (looks sharply at Thompson) You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar? \nTHOMPSON Sorry, Mr. Leland. \nLELAND Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth. \nTHOMPSON Maybe you could remember something that - \nLELAND I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory - I was his oldest friend. (slowly) As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge - \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT - \nThe party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence). \nWe start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of the table.  Kane is heard off, making a speech. \nKANE'S VOICE Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty.  It's your talent I'm interested in.  That talent that's going to make the \"Enquirer\" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world! \nApplause.  During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side. \nBERNSTEIN Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party! \nLELAND Yes. \nHis tone causes Bernstein to look at him. \nKANE'S VOICE However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. \nThe above speeches are heard under the following dialogue. \nBERNSTEIN (to Leland) What's the matter? \nLELAND Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the \"Enquirer\" - who were with the \"Chronicle\" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the \"Chronicle\" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper? \nBERNSTEIN Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it. (proudly) Only they happen to be the best men in the business. \nKANE (finishing his speech) There are other subjects in the world - \nKane whistles.  The band and the chorus girls enter and hell breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein. \nLELAND (after a minute) Do we stand for the same things that the \"Chronicle\" stands for, Mr. Bernstein? \nBERNSTEIN (indignantly) Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week. \nLELAND Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it. \nKane has come up to Leland and Bernstein.  He sits down next to them, lighting a cigarette. \nKANE Well, gentlemen, are we going to war? \nLELAND Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country. \nLeland shakes his head.  Kane lifts his glass. \nKANE To love on my terms.  Those are the only terms anybody knows ... his own. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT - \nKane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of the front toward a hansom cab. \nA VOICE FROM THE CROWD You moiderer! \nA rock is thrown.  It hits Leland on the face.  A little blood flows.  Kane doesn't see it at first.  Then when he's in the hansom cab, he turns and notices it. \nKANE Are you hurt? \nLeland has a handkerchief to his face. \nLELAND No.  I wish you'd go home to Emily. She'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you - \nThe crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but still hard by. \nKANE You still want to be transferred to the other paper? \nLELAND Yes. \nKANE (leaning out of the hansom cab) Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. (almost as a question) \nLELAND (with handkerchief still attached to his face) I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is. \nThe hansom cab starts up.  We hold on Leland's face as we \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. KANE'S NEW YORK HOME - KANE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - \nEmily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples.  Kane is standing at the foot of the bed.  The baby's bed is in a corner of the room.  The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a nurse for Emily is near her.  Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, who is staring tiredly at the ceiling. \nKANE (to the nurse) Excuse us a moment, please. \nThe nurse looks at Emily. \nKANE (peremptorily) I said, excuse us a moment. \nThe nurse, unwilling, leaves. \nKANE I've been talking to Leland.  Emily - You can't leave me now - not now - \nSilence. \nKANE It isn't what it would do to my changes in politics, Emily -  That isn't it -  They were talking of running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily -  It's just - the president is your uncle and they're saying I killed him. \nStill silence. \nKANE That story about the murderer having a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his pocket - the \"Chronicle\" made that up out of whole cloth -  Emily, please - He's going to be all right, you know, he's going to recover - (bitterly) If it will make you any happier, we had nine pages of advertising cancelled in the first mail this morning.  Bernstein is afraid to open any more letters.  He - \nHe stops.  He sees that he's getting no place with Emily. \nKANE (exasperated) What do you expect me to do?  What in the world - \nEMILY (weakly) Charles. \nHe waits for her to continue. \nEMILY Do you really think - (she can't continue) Those threatening letters, can they really - \nShe sits up and looks at the crib.  She almost continues to look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes. \nKANE (uncomfortably) They won't do anything to Junior, darling. (contemptuously) Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange - \nEMILY (turning her face toward him) Please don't talk any more, Charles. \nKane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead. Emily keeps staring at him. \nEMILY Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen - \nKANE I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind. \nEmily nods several times.  There is an uncomforable silence. Suddenly there is a cry from the crib.  Emily leaps from the bed and rushes to him.  She bends over the crib. \nEMILY (murmuring) Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here. \nKANE Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me. \nEMILY They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you! \nKane, unwanted, ignored, looks on.  Tightening his lips, he walks out. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThere are good nights.  Kane's car is at the curb and he starts to walk toward it with Junior and Emily. \nEMILY I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver - \nKANE But I'd arranged to go home with you myself. \nEMILY There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles. \nKANE It can wait. \nEMILY No, it can't. (she bends down and kisses Junior) Good night, darling. \nJUNIOR Good night, Mom. \nThe driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior in. \nKANE (as car starts to drive off) What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and - \nEMILY It may not be about anything at all. \nA cab has pulled up. \nTHE DRIVER Cab? \nEmily nods to him. \nEMILY I intend to find out. \nKANE I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind. \nEMILY I'm going to - (she looks at a slip of paper in her hand) - 185 West 74th Street. \nKane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means something to him. \nEMILY If you wish, you can come with me... \nKane nods. \nKANE I'll go with you. \nHe opens the door and she enters the cab.  He follows her. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CAB - NIGHT - \nKane and Emily.  He looks at her, in search of some kind of enlightenment.  Her face is set and impassive. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT - \nKane and Emily, in front of an apartment door.  Emily is pressing the bell. \nKANE I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy. \nEmily does not answer.  The door is opened by a maid, who recognizes Kane. \nTHE MAID Come in, Mr. Kane, come in. \nThey enter, Emily first. \nINT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - \nThere is first a tiny reception room, through which an open door shows the living room.  Kane and Emily enter from the hallway and cross to the living room.  As they enter, Susan rises from a chair.  The other person  in the room - a big, heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently. \nSUSAN It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He made me send your wife a note. He said I'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things, I didn't know what to do...  I - (she catches sight of Emily) \nROGERS Good evening, Mr. Kane. (he rises) I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am Edward Rogers. \nEMILY How do you do? (pauses) I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... (she consults the note in her hand without reading it again) because I recieved this note - \nROGERS I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first - (he smiles grimly) but she did it. \nSUSAN I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea - \nKANE (turning on Rogers) Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. (he starts toward him) To start with, I'll break your neck. \nROGERS (not giving way an inch) Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane. \nEMILY Charles! (he stops to look at her) Your - your breaking this man's neck - (she is clearly disgusted) would scarcely explain this note - (glancing at the note) Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - (slowly) for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss - \nSUSAN (stiffly) I'm Susan Alexander. (pauses) I know what you think, Mrs. Kane, but - \nEMILY (ignoring this) What does this note mean, Miss Alexander? \nROGERS She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it. \nKANE In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - (he puts a world of scorn into the word) is - \nROGERS I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is. (tensely, with all the hatred and venom in the world) You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother. (he has to control himself from hurling himself at Kane) It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman. \nEMILY Oh!! \nKANE You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother - \nKANE What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go? \nEMILY Goodnight, Charles. \nShe walks out.  Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of Kane. \nROGERS You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. Only you're going to need more than one lesson.  And you're going to get more than one lesson. (he walks past Kane) \nKANE Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes - \nINT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT - \nCamera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall.  Rogers and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground. Kane in apartment doorway background. \nKANE (screams louder) I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, Rogers.  Sing Sing! \nKane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's back.  Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his shoulder as they stand in the doorway. \nDISSOLVE: \nThe \"Chronicle\" front page with photograph (as in the \"News Digest\") revealing Kane's relations with Susan. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nFront page of \"Chronicle\" - Headline which reads: \nROGERS ELECTED \nDISSOLVE: \nFront page of \"Enquirer\" - Headline which reads: \nFRAUD AT POLLS \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - \nEmily is opening the door for Leland. \nEMILY Hello, Brad - \nLELAND Emily - \nHe pauses.  Leland comes in.  Emily closes the door. \nEMILY I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - didn't - \nLELAND Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours - \nShe doesn't have anything to say. \nLELAND I'm glad to see you. \nShe smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in the world for her to smile at.  She's too grateful to talk. \nEMILY Are all the returns in? \nLeland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper. \nEMILY Let me see it. \nLeland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her.  She takes it.  We see the headline, not an insert, but it registers.  It reads: \"Fraud at Polls.\"  Emily is looking at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile. \nLELAND (after a pause) Almost two to one - \nEMILY I'm surprised he got the votes he did. \nLELAND Emily! \nEMILY Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars. \nLELAND Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives - \nEMILY There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then - \nLELAND know that, Emily - \nEMILY (on top of Leland) Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was. \nLELAND (on the cue \"dog\") Emily, you - \nEMILY Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet - \nLELAND It's - all over - \nHe stops himself. \nEMILY (after a pause) Know it is, Brad - \nLELAND He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically - (he thinks) - socially, everywhere, I guess. don't know about the papers, but - \nEMILY If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. (pauses) There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad. \nLELAND (testily) All right, all right. (he has begun to move forward on the Nurse's arm; turning to Thompson) You won't forget, will you, about the cigars?  And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste, or something, or they'll stop them at the desk.  That young doctor I was telling you about, he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. \"EL RANCHO\" CABARET IN ATLANTIC CITY - EARLY DAWN - \nNEON SIGN ON THE ROOF: \n\"EL RANCHO\" \nFLOOR SHOW \nSUSAN ALEXANDER KANE \nTWICE NIGHTLY \nglows on the dark screen as in the previous sequence earlier in the script.  Behind the lights and through them, we see a nasty early morning.  Camera as before, moves through the lights of the sign and down on the skylight, through which is seen Susan at her regular table,  Thompson seated across from her. \nVery faintly during this, idle piano music playing. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. \"EL RANCHO\" CABARET - EARLY DAWN - \nSusan and Thompson are facing each other.  The place is almost deserted.  Susan is sober.  On the other side of the room, somebody is playing a piano. \nSUSAN How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions? \nTHOMPSON I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane. \nSUSAN You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane. \nSusan is thinking. \nTHOMPSON How did you meet him? \nSUSAN I had a toothache. \nThompson looks at her. \nSUSAN That was thiry years ago - and I still remember that toothache. Boy!  That toothache was just driving me crazy... \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nEXT. CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW YORK - NIGHT - \nSusan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of the period, is leaving the drug store.  It's about 8 o'clock at night.  With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her cheek, she is in considerable pain.  The street is wet - after a recent rain. \nShe walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs her gums. \nShe walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps. \nAs she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud. \nKANE (hopping up and down and rubbing his knee) Ow! \nSusan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with laughter. \nKANE It's not funny. \nHe bites his lip and rubs his knee again.  Susan tries to control her laughter, but not very successfully.  Kane glares at her. \nSUSAN I'm sorry, mister - but you do look awful funny. \nSuddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw. \nSUSAN Ow! \nKANE What's the matter with you? \nSUSAN Toothache. \nKANE Hmm! \nHe has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief. \nSUSAN You've got some on your face. \nKANE If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter - \nSusan starts to laugh again. \nKANE What's funny now? \nSUSAN You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies. \nIn the middle of her smile, the pain returns. \nSUSAN Oh! \nKANE You're no Venus de Milo. \nSUSAN (points to the downstair window) If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers - \nSUSAN Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, guess you caught on to that - \nKANE (looks squarely at her) You really don't know who I am? \nSUSAN No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is - \nKANE But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am? \nSUSAN You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - (she stops) \nKANE And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. (he smiles) Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes? \nSUSAN I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes. \nKANE (as if defending himself from a terrible onslaught) I was only joking! (pauses) This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth. \nSusan is bewildered. \nKANE You see, my mother died, too - a long time ago.  Her things were put into storage out west because I had no place to put them then. I still haven't.  But now I've sent for them just the same.  And tonight I'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey - (slowly) - to the scenes of my youth - my childhood, I suppose - to look again at - (he changes mood slightly) and now - \nKane doesn't finish.  He looks at Susan.  Silence. \nKANE Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - (he stops on the word \"sixty\" - obviously a little embarrassed) I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you? \nSUSAN Oh, me - \nKANE How old did you say you were? \nSUSAN (very bright) I didn't say. \nKANE I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old? \nSUSAN Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August. \nKANE (looks at her silently for a moment) That's a ripe old age -  What do you do? \nSUSAN I work at Seligman's. \nKANE Is that what you want to do? \nSUSAN I want to be a singer. (she thinks for a moment) I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me. \nKANE (sympathetically) What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you? \nSUSAN Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like. \nA sudden look comes over Kane's face. \nKANE Yes - \nSUSAN As a matter of fact, I do sing a little. \nKANE (points to the piano) Would you sing for me? \nSUSAN (bashful) Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing. \nKANE Yes, I would.  That's why I asked. \nSUSAN Well, I - \nKANE Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again? \nSUSAN Oh, no, that's all gone. \nKANE Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing. \nSusan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and sings a polite song.  Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, untrained voice.  Kane listens.  He is relaxed, at ease with the world. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. \"EL RANCHO\" CABARET - EARLY DAWN - \nSusan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story. \nSUSAN I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't - \nTHOMPSON What did you get? \nSUSAN (glares at him balefully) What do you mean? \nThompson doesn't answer. \nSUSAN I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it. \nTHOMPSON He married you, didn't he? \nSUSAN He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him. \nTHOMPSON What about that apartment? \nSUSAN He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice. (sharply) What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. LIVING ROOM OF KANE'S HOUSE IN NEW YORK - DAY - \nThe door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling over the side.  Kane rushes to her. \nKANE Get Dr. Corey. \nRAYMOND Yes, sir. \nHe rushes out.  Susan is breathing, but heavily.  Kane loosens the lace collar at her throat. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT - \nA little later.  All the lights are lit.  Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep.  Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him.  Dr. Corey rises. \nDR. COREY She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane. \nKane nods.  He has a small bottle in his hand. \nDR. COREY The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning. \nKANE Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her. \nDR. COREY I'm sure that's it. (he starts out) \nKANE There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there? \nDR. COREY Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too. \nKANE Of course. \nDr. Corey leaves.  Kane settles himself in a chair next to the bed, looking at Susan.  In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY - \nSusan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed. Kane is in the chair beside her.  The nurse is out of the room. \nSUSAN (in a voice that comes from far away) I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again.  You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know...  They don't want you.  They just - \nKANE (angrily) That's when you've got to fight them.  That's when you've got to make them.  That's - \nSusan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic eyes. \nKANE I'm sorry. (he leans over to pat her hand) You won't have to fight them anymore. (he smiles a little) It's their loss. \nGratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over to cover his. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT \nINT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU - \nCloseup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle.  A hand is putting in the last piece.  Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle spread out on the floor. \nSusan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle.  Kane is in an easy chair.  Behind them towers the massive Renaissance fireplace.  It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the scene. \nSUSAN (with a sigh) What time is it? \nThere is no answer. \nSUSAN Charlie!  I said, what time is it? \nKANE (looks up - consults his watch) Half past eleven. \nSUSAN I mean in New York. \nKANE Half past eleven. \nSUSAN At night? \nKANE Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press. \nSUSAN (sarcastically) Hurray for the bulldog! (sighs) Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world. \nKANE You always said you wanted to live in a palace. \nSUSAN Can't we go back, Charlie? \nKane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work. \nSUSAN Charlie - \nThere is no answer. \nSUSAN If I promise to be a good girl! Not to drink - and to entertain all the governors and the senators with dignity - (she puts a slur into the word) Charlie - \nThere is still no answer. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nAnother picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece. \nSUSAN Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you - \nWithout a word, Kane slaps her across the face.  They look at each other. \nSUSAN You - you hit me. \nKane continues to look at her. \nSUSAN You'll never have another chance to hit me again. (pauses) Never knew till this minute - \nKANE Susan, it seems to me - \nSUSAN Don't tell me you're sorry. \nKANE I'm not sorry. \nSUSAN I'm going to leave you. \nKANE No, you're not. \nSUSAN (nods) Yes. \nThey look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way. In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and unbelievable. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S STUDY - XANADU - DAY - \nKane is a the window looking out.  He turns as he hears Raymond enter. \nRAYMOND Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane. \nKANE All right. \nRaymond waits as Kane hesitates. \nKANE Is Mrs. Kane - (he can't finish) \nRAYMOND Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane. \nKane impetuously walks past him out of the room. \nINT. SUSAN'S ROOM - XANADU - DAY - \nPacked suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed for travelling.  Kane bursts into the room. \nSUSAN Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.  He can get the bags. \nMARIE Yes, Mrs. Kane. \nShe leaves.  Kane closes the door behind her. \nKANE Have you gone completely crazy? \nSusan looks at him. \nKANE Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and - \nSUSAN - And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know. \nKane is standing against the door as if physically barring her way. \nKANE I won't let you go. \nSUSAN You can't stop me. \nKane keeps looking at her.  Susan reaches out her hand. \nSUSAN Goodbye, Charlie. \nKANE (suddenly) Don't go, Susan. \nSUSAN Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said. \nKANE Susan, don't go!  Susan, please! \nHe has lost all pride.  Susan stops.  She is affected by this. \nKANE You mustn't go, Susan. Everything'll be exactly the way you want it.  Not the way I think you want it - by your way.  Please, Susan - Susan! \nShe is staring at him.  She might weaken. \nKANE Don't go, Susan!  You mustn't go! (almost blubbering) You - you can't do this to me, Susan - \nIt's as if he had thrown ice water into her face.  She freezes. \nSUSAN I see - it's you that this is being done to!  It's not me at all.  Not how I feel.  Not what it means to me. (she laughs) I can't do this to you! (she looks at him) Oh, yes I can. \nShe walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a very tired old man. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. \"EL RANCHO\" CABARET - NIGHT - \n", "test1_input": "Bernstein and Leland on deck. \nBERNSTEIN (turns to Leland) Do you, Mr. Leland? \nLELAND (smiling) Certainly not. \nSlight pause.

Bernstein looks at him. \nLELAND Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully. \nBERNSTEIN Don't I always?  Most of the time? \nLELAND Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm? \nBERNSTEIN Yes. \nLeland is surprised. \nBERNSTEIN If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't. \nLELAND (good naturedly) You're in a conspiracy against me, you two.  You always have been. \nBERNSTEIN Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time! \nHe pauses.  \"Auld Lang Syne\" can still be heard from the deck of the department steamer. \nBERNSTEIN (with a hopeful look in his eyes) Well, he'll be coming back in September.  The Majestic.  I got the reservations.  It gets in on the ninth. \nLELAND September the ninth? \nLeland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write. \nLeland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open to September 9: \"Rector's - 8:30 p.m.\" \nDISSOLVE: \nFront page \"Enquirer.\"  Large picture of the young couple - Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy. \nEXT.

I know about Mr. Rawlston. \nTHOMPSON He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got. \nLELAND (reading) I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. \nShe has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson. \nLELAND Brief marriage!  Ten years! (sighs) \nTHOMPSON Was he in love? \nLELAND He married for love - (a little laugh) That's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love.  That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides - \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nNewspaper - Kane's marriage to Emily with still of group on White House lawn, same setup as early newsreel in News Digest. \nDISSOLVE: \nScreaming headline: OIL SCANDAL! \nDISSOLVE: \nHeadline reading: KANE TO SEE PRESIDENT \nDISSOLVE: \nBig headline on \"Enquirer\" front page which reads: KANE TO SEE PRESIDENT \nUnder this, one of those big box signed editorials, typical of Kane, illustrated, on subject of the power of the president, expressed in about nine different cases of type, and illustrated by a cartoon of the White House, on which camera tightens, as we - \nDISSOLVE OUT: \n", "test1_true": "INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY - \nThis scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at least never his face.  There is present the President's Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking notes.  Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and glaring. \nTHE PRESIDENT It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people. (pauses) You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical? \nKANE I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks! \nTHE PRESIDENT (calmly) I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane. \nKANE (screaming) It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts - \nTHE PRESIDENT I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean. (pause) You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane. \nKANE Thanks. \nTHE PRESIDENT I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own - \nKANE (building to a frenzy) I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of - \nTHE PRESIDENT (interrupting) You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.

They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but Kane's back is in the way ... so we can't read it. \nFOREMAN How about it, Mr. Kane? \nReilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face.  Kane smiles as he notices this. \nKANE All right.  Let her slide! \nHe turns away, and we can now read the headline. \nInsert of the headline, which reads: \"OIL THEFT BECOMES LAW AS PRESIDENT WITHOLDS VETO\" \nDISSOLVE: \nHere follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of no more than four or five images in which the President, by means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked.

On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music. Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily.  He has a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his hand.  Emily rises.  He shows the paper to her. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE ENQUIRER BUILDING - NIGHT - \nAn angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office.  They make a deep threatening sound which is audible during the following scene.  Across the heads of the crowd are two great squares of light from the windows above them.  One of these disappears as the blind is pulled.  As the dissolve completes itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland pulls down, covering the entire frame. \n", "test1_id": 1596, "test2_input": "INT. KANE'S OFFICE - ENQUIRER - NIGHT - \nThe staff standing around, worried to death, in their shirtsleeves. \nKANE (to Reilly) Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  \"This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -\" \nLELAND Charlie - \nKANE Yes? \nLELAND Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man? \nKANE Why not? \nLELAND Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead. \nREILLY (quickly) Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition. \nKANE (still looking at Leland) What do you mean by that? \nLELAND (quietly) Competition. \nREILLY He may recover - \nKANE (still holding on Leland) What do you mean by that? \nLELAND (steadily) Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him. \nKANE Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the \"Enquirer\" in his pocket? \nLELAND - and that copy of the \"Enquirer\" said the President should be killed. \nKANE I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death - \nLELAND You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months. \nKANE They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason! \nLELAND (interrupting) Charlie! \nKANE (riding over him) Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because - \nLELAND Look out that window. \nKane stops - looks at him. \nLELAND There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it. \nKANE (snarling) What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? (he turns to Reilly) Run it the way I said, Reilly - \"This afternoon a great man was assassinated -\" \nLELAND Charlie!  Now you're not making sense. \nKANE (sharply) I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her. \nLELAND What? \nKANE I've got to think of Emily - \nLELAND (after a silence) I'd like to talk to you about that. \nKANE Go ahead. \nLeland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing around. \nLELAND Finish your editorial. \nLeland walks out in to the City Room.  More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic.  Leland goes to his desk, takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink.  A door opens.  A Policeman enters with Bernstein.  Bernstein is badly battered.  The boys crowd around. \nLELAND (worried) What's happened? \nBERNSTEIN (smiling) I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer? \nTHE COP (grinning) You sure did -  Say, the Commissioner said I was to stand by and protect Mr. Kane until further orders, no matter how he felt about it.  Where is he? \nLELAND (finishing his drink) In there. \nBERNSTEIN If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows. \nLELAND (pouring himself another drink) Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. (he looks his face over thoroughly) There doesn't seem to be an serious injury. \nBERNSTEIN Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you? \nLELAND Yes, Mr. Bernstein. \nBernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance. Leland finishes his second drink. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT - \nThe bottle is finished.  The door in the Sanctrum opens.  Reilly and the others leave. \nREILLY (as they go) Goodnight, Mr. Kane. \nKane stands in the door, waiting for Leland.  Leland gets up and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from Kane at the desk.  An uncomfortable pause.  Then Kane smiles ingratiatingly.  Leland tries to cope with this. \n", "test2_true": "KANE (not cruelly - genuinely kind) What's wrong, Brad? \nLELAND I'm drunk. \nKANE I'll get you some coffee. \nHe rises and goes to the door. \nLELAND First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the \"Enquirer.\" \nKANE (gently - opening the door) That's just a little promotion scheme.  Nobody expects you - (calling) Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee? \nMIKE'S VOICE Sure thing, Mr. Kane. \nKane turns back to Leland.  Leland doesn't look up at him. \nLELAND Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago. \nKANE Why, Brad? \nLELAND I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - (he is heartsick, inarticulate) That's not what I wanted to talk about. \nKane goes around behind the desk and sits down. \nKANE I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help. \nLELAND No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily. \nKane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks. \nKANE (quietly) All right. \nLELAND (without looking at him) She's going to leave you - \nKANE I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger. (ruefully) It seems I didn't kill him after all. \nLELAND (takes his eye) She was going to leave you anyway - \nKane takes this in. \nLELAND Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back - \nKANE (sharply) Brad, you are drunk. \nLELAND Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong - \nKANE Why is she leaving me? \nLELAND (it's very hard for him to say all this) She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you. \nKANE Do you think the \"Enquirer\" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases? \nLELAND (hesitating) You might have made the whole thing less personal! \nNo answer from Kane. \nLELAND It isn't just that the President was her uncle - everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important - \nStill no answer from Kane. \nLELAND There's no reason why this - this savage personal note - \nKANE The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally.  They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers. \nLELAND You almost convince me. (rising) I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. You know that.  That's why you keep me around. (smiles) You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that. \nKane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now.  He speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a disease. \nLELAND You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty.  Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal.  Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys. \nKANE Are you finished? \nLELAND Yes. (looking down) Now, will you let me go to Chicago? \nKANE (with a little smile) You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg - \nLELAND That's all right. (he won't be charmed out of his duty) What are you going to do about Emily? \nKANE (his face hardning a little) Nothing - if she dosen't love me - \nLeland has risen.  He speaks as he turns away, starting towards the door. \nLELAND You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - (he stops - his back turned to Kane) Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt! \nKANE It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner - \nLeland has turned, taking his eye again.  Now Kane stops and smiles. \nKANE She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live. \nLELAND I know you will. \nKANE (with all his charm) Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy. \n", "test2_id": 1597, "test3_input": "As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO 19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt. Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words: \nCHARLES FOSTER KANE II. \nONE OF THE WORKMEN Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able to cement it till tommorrow.  We - \nKane looks right through him.  Raymond cuts him short. \nRAYMOND Okay. \nThe men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel.  Kane raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank place which will be occupied by Kane himself. \nKANE Do you like poetry, Raymond? \nRAYMOND Can't say, sir. \nKANE Mrs. Kane liked poetry - \nRaymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone indeed - not to say off his trolley. \nRAYMOND Yes, Mr. Kane. \nKANE Not my wife - not either of them. \nHe looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked \"MARY KANE.\" \nRAYMOND (catching on) Oh, yes, sir. \nKANE (looking back up at the wall) Do you know what that is? \nRAYMOND (more his keeper than his butler now) It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane. \nKANE Persia.  It belonged to a king. \nRAYMOND How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane? \nKANE He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means? \nRAYMOND No, I don't, Mr. Kane. \nKANE I didn't used to be afraid of it. \nA short pause.  His eyes still on the wall, but looking through it, Kane quotes the translation. \nKANE The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet I saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory, I thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not.  I called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me, I opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: \"Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth.\" But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that I died And Death came to sit upon my throne.  O sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step.  He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China. (quoting) O sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it.  Where are the men with towering hopes? They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace. \nKane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it. Raymond looks at him. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - \nThompson and Raymond.  Raymond has finished his beer. \nRAYMOND (callously) That's the whole works, right up to date. \nTHOMPSON Sentimental fellow, aren't you? \nRAYMOND Yes and no. \nTHOMPSON (getting to his feet) Well, thanks a lot. \nRAYMOND See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him. (rises) That \"Rosebud\" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said \"Rosebud\" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him. \nThompson doesn't answer. \nRAYMOND You can go on asking questions if you want to. \nTHOMPSON (coldly) We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff - \nThompson has risen.  Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the door, opening it for him. \nRAYMOND Allow yourself plenty of time. The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait.  Not now.  I can remember when they'd wait all day ... if Mr. Kane said so. \nRaymond ushes Thompson into \nINT. THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT - \nThe magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and small, are piled pell mell all over the place.  Furniture, statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same story.  Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, rustling the papers. \nIn the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant are busy photographing the sundry objects.  The floor is littered with burnt-out flash bulbs.  They continue their work throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a flash bulb goes off.  In addition to the Photographer and his Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and Raymond. \nThe Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph. A flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer has just photographed a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive. The Assistant consults a label on the back of it. \nASSISTANT NO. 9182 \nThe Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down. \nASSISTANT \"Nativity\" - attributed to Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, cost 45,000 lira.  Got that? \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Yeah. \nPHOTOGRAPHER All right!  Next!  Better get that statue over there. \n", "test3_true": "The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the hall. \nRAYMOND What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson? \nTHOMPSON Millions - if anybody wants it. \nRAYMOND The banks are out of luck, eh? \nTHOMPSON Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right. \nASSISTANT \"Venus,\" Fourth Century.  Acquired 1911.  Cost twenty-three thousand. Got it? \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay. \nASSISTANT (patting the statue on the fanny) That's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head. \nSECOND ASSISTANT (reading a label) No. 483.  One desk from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado.  Value $6.00. \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay. \nA flashlight bulb goes off. \nSECOND ASSISTANT We're all set to get everything. The junk as well as the art. \nThompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful of little pieces of cardboard. \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN What's that? \nRAYMOND It's a jigsaw puzzle. \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN We got a lot of those.  There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall. \nRaymond laughs. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Yeah, all in crates. \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it. \nPHOTOGRAPHER I wonder how they put all those pieces together? \nASSISTANT (reading a label) Iron stove.  Estate of Mary Kane. Value $2.00. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Put it over by that statue.  It'll make a good setup. \nGIRL (calling out) Who is she anyway? \nSECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Venus.  She always is. \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN He sure liked to collect things, didn't he? \nRAYMOND He went right on buying - right up to the end. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Anything and everything - he was a regular crow. \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell? \nThompson has turned around.  He is facing the camera for the first time. \nTHOMPSON Charles Foster Kane. \nAnother flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer turns to Thompson with a grin. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry? \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN (to the dancers) Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud? \nPHOTOGRAPHER Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? (to the Third Newspaperman) That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry?  Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry? \nTHOMPSON No, I didn't. \nThe music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson. \nSECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry? \nTHOMPSON Not much. \nSECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Well, what have you been doing? \nTHOMPSON Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I talked to a lot of people who knew him. \nGIRL What do they say? \nTHOMPSON Well - it's become a very clear picture.  He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide.  He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - \"Live and Let Live\" - that was his motto.  But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was.  He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it.  He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with.  Outside of that - \nTHIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay, okay. \nGIRL What about Rosebud?  Don't you think that explains anything? \nTHOMPSON No, I don't.  Not much anway. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything.  I don't think any word explains a man's life.  No -  I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece. \nHe drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch. \nTHOMPSON We'd better get along.  We'll miss the train. \n", "test3_id": 1598}

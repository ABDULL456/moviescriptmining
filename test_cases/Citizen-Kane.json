{"test1_input": "CITIZEN KANE \nCitizen Kane \nBy \nHerman J. Mankiewicz \nOrson Welles \nPROLOGUE \nFADE IN: \nEXT. XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE) \nWindow, very small in the distance, illuminated. \nAll around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it - a huge initial \"K\" showing darker and darker against the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness. \nDISSOLVE: \nA SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL TELLING SOMETHING OF: \nThe literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE. \nIts right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good- sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain. \nDISSOLVE: \nGOLF LINKS (MINIATURE) \nPast which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nWHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE) \nOf the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.) \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE) \nIn the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE) \nThe idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - the lighted window. \nTHE LAGOON (MINIATURE) \nThe boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer.\"  As it moves across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the window in the castle, closer than before. \nTHE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE) \nIt is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE COTTAGES (MINIATURE) \nIn the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nA DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE) \nOver a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last King died. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE WINDOW (MINIATURE) \nCamera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - \nA very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against the enormous window. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE. \nAn incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to Indian Temple bells - the music freezes - \nKANE'S OLD OLD VOICE Rosebud... \n", "test1_true": "The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at the face after the sheet has covered it. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. OF A MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOM \nOn the screen as the camera moves in are the words: \n\"MAIN TITLE\" \nStirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours.) \nThe screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second title appears: \n\"CREDITS\" \nNOTE:  Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events or personalities.  These are distinguished from ordinary newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed editorial or storyline.  Some of the more obvious characteristics of the \"March of Time,\" for example, as well as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject. As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator is used as well as explanatory titles. \nFADE OUT: \nNEWS DIGEST NARRATOR Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Kahn decreed his stately pleasure dome - (with quotes in his voice) \"Where twice five miles of fertile ground, with walls and towers were girdled 'round.\" \n(DROPPING THE QUOTES) Today, almost as legendary is Florida's XANADU - world's largest private pleasure ground.  Here, on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned, successfully built for its landlord. Here in a private valley, as in the Coleridge poem, \"blossoms many an incense-bearing tree.\"  Verily, \"a miracle of rare device.\" \nU.S.A. \nCHARLES FOSTER KANE \nOpening shot of great desolate expanse of Florida coastline (1940 - DAY) \nDISSOLVE: \nSeries of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the Prologue (1940). \nNARRATOR (dropping the quotes) Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will be held 1940's biggest, strangest funeral; here this week is laid to rest a potent figure of our Century - America's Kubla Kahn - Charles Foster Kane.  In journalism's history, other names are honored more than Charles Foster Kane's, more justly revered.  Among publishers, second only to James Gordon Bennet the First: his dashing, expatriate son; England's Northcliffe and Beaverbrook; Chicago's Patterson and McCormick; \nTITLE: \nTO FORTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. NEWS BUYERS, MORE NEWSWORTHY THAN THE NAMES IN HIS OWN HEADLINES, WAS KANE HIMSELF, GREATEST NEWSPAPER TYCOON OF THIS OR ANY OTHER GENERATION. \nShot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane.  Pull back to show that it is a picture on the front page of the \"Enquirer,\" surrounded by the reversed rules of mourning, with masthead and headlines. (1940) \nDISSOLVE: \nA great number of headlines, set in different types and different styles, obviously from different papers, all announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign languages).  An important item in connection with the headlines is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately conflicting opinions about Kane.  Thus, they contain variously the words \"patriot,\" \"democrat,\" \"pacifist,\" \"war-monger,\" \"traitor,\" \"idealist,\" \"American,\" etc. \nTITLE: \n1895 TO 1940 - ALL OF THESE YEARS HE COVERED, MANY OF THESE YEARS HE WAS. \nNewsreel shots of San Francisco during and after the fire, followed by shots of special trains with large streamers: \"Kane Relief Organization.\"  Over these shots superimpose the date - \nArtist's painting of Foch's railroad car and peace negotiators, if actual newsreel shot unavailable.  Over this shot sumperimpose the date - 1918. \nNARRATOR Denver's Bonfils and Sommes; New York's late, great Joseph Pulitzer; America's emperor of the news syndicate, another editorialist and landlord, the still mighty and once mightier Hearst.  Great names all of them - but none of them so loved, hated, feared, so often spoken - as Charles Foster Kane. The San Francisco earthquake. First with the news were the Kane papers.  First with Relief of the Sufferers, First with the news of their Relief of the Sufferers. Kane papers scoop the world on the Armistice - publish, eight hours before competitors, complete details of the Armistice teams granted the Germans by Marshall Foch from his railroad car in the Forest of Compeigne.  For forty years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand. No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce - often support, then denounce.  Its humble beginnings, a dying dailey - \nShots with the date - 1898 (to be supplied) \nShots with the date - 1910 (to be supplied) \nShots with the date - 1922 (to be supplied) \nHeadlines, cartoons, contemporary newreels or stills of the following: \n1. WOMAN SUFFRAGE \nThe celebrated newsreel shot of about 1914. \n2. PROHIBITION \nBreaking up of a speakeasy and such. \n3.  T.V.A. \n4. LABOR RIOTS \nBrief clips of old newreel shots of William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, Stalin, Walter P. Thatcher, Al Smith, McKinley, Landon, Franklin D. Roosevelt and such.  Also, recent newsreels of the elderly Kane with such Nazis as Hitler and Goering; and England's Chamberlain and Churchill. \nShot of a ramshackle building with old-fashioned presses showing through plate glass windows and the name \"Enquirer\" in old- fashioned gold letters. (1892) \nDISSOLVE: \nNARRATOR Kane's empire, in its glory, held dominion over thirty-seven newpapers, thirteen magazines, a radio network.  An empire upon an empire.  The first of grocery stores, paper mills, apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean-liners - An empire through which for fifty years flowed, in an unending stream, the wealth of the earth's third richest gold mine...  Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune... How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mine shaft: The Colorado Lode. The magnificent Enquirer Building of today. \n1891-1911 - a map of the USA, covering the entire screen, which in animated diagram shows the Kane publications spreading from city to city.  Starting from New York, minature newboys speed madly to Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, El Paso, etc., screaming \"Wuxtry, Kane Papers, Wuxtry.\" \nShot of a large mine going full blast, chimneys belching smoke, trains moving in and out, etc.  A large sign reads \"Colorado Lode Mining Co.\" (1940)  Sign reading; \"Little Salem, CO - 25 MILES.\" \nDISSOLVE: \nAn old still shot of Little Salem as it was 70 years ago (identified by copper-plate caption beneath the still). (1870) \n", "test1_id": 1596, "test2_input": "DISSOLVE: \nINT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN - \nThe newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter but very insistent. \nKane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the Enquirer building. \nKane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair. \nNEWSBOYS' VOICES CHRONICLE!  CHRONICLE!  H'YA - THE CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE! \nKane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, are very much fainter after this. \nLELAND We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes. \nBERNSTEIN (looking at his watch) It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it - \nLeland rises from the chair, stretching painfully. \nKANE Tired? \nLELAND It's been a tough day. \nKANE A wasted day. \nBERNSTEIN (looking up) Wasted? \nLELAND (incredulously) Charlie?! \nBERNSTEIN You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all - \nKANE I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the \"New York Enquirer\" as important to New York as the gas in that light. \nLELAND (quietly) What're you going to do, Charlie? \nKane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy concentration. \nKANE My Declaration of Principles - (he says it with quotes around it) Don't smile, Brad - (getting the idea) Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein - \nBERNSTEIN Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane - \nKANE I'll write it myself. \nKane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon.  Sitting down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write. \nBERNSTEIN (looking over his shoulder) You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep. \nKANE (as he writes) These'll be kept. (stops for a minute and reads what he has written; reading) I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. (starts to write again; reading as he writes) will also provide them - \nLELAND That's the second sentence you've started with \"I\" - \nKANE (looking up) People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. (he speaks with real conviction) And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news. \nHe looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, reading as he writes. \nBernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane.  They both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side. Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette. Bernstein is still smoking a cigar. \nDISSOLVE: \nFront page of the \"Enquirer\" shows big boxed editorial with heading: \nMY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE \nCamera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six piles and go on back until we see a big field of \"Enquirers\" - piles of \"Enquirers\" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution. \nA wagon with a huge sign on its side reading \n\"ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000\" \npasses through foreground, and we wipe to: \nA pile of \"Enquirers\" for sale on a broken down wooden box on a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins fall on the pile. \nThe stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front wheel.  A copy of the \"Enquirer\" is tossed on the stoop. \nA breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the \"Enquirer\". Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the front page. \nThe wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, there is tossed a bound bundle of the \"New York Enquirer\" - the Declaration of Principles still prominent. \nRural Delivery - a copy of the \"Enquirer\"s being put into bins, showing state distribution. \nThe railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images. On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles of the \"Enquirer\" are larger.  On the first image, we move in to hold on the words \"CIRCULATION - 31,000.\"  We are this close for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased. \nThe entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train. \nThe last figure \"62,000\" opposite the word \"CIRCULATION\" on the \"Enquirer\" masthead changes to: \nEXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY - \nAngle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting the last zero to the figure \"62,000\" on an enormous sign advertising the \"Enquirer.\"  It reads: \nTHE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000 \nCamera travels down side of building - takes in another building on which there is a sign which reads: \n", "test2_true": "Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the Chronicle office.  The Chronicle office has a plateglass window in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching peanuts. \nInside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of the \"Chronicle\" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the center.  A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE.  A sign beneath it reads: GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD.  The sign also includes the \"Chronicle\" circulation figure.  There are nine men in the photo. \nBERNSTEIN (looking up at the sign - happily) Sixty-two thousand - \nLELAND That looks pretty nice. \nKANE (indicating the Chronicle Building) Let's hope they like it there. \nBERNSTEIN From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough. \nKANE (pointing to the sign over the photograph in the window) Look at that. \nLELAND The \"Chronicle\" is a good newspaper. \nKANE It's a good idea for a newspaper. (reading the figures) Four hundred sixy thousand. \nBERNSTEIN Say, with them fellows - (referring to the photo) - it's no trick to get circulation. \nKANE You're right, Mr. Bernstein. \nBERNSTEIN (sighs) You know how long it took the \"Chronicle\" to get that staff together?  Twenty years. \nKANE I know. \nKane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking into the window.  Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CITY ROOM - THE ENQUIRER - NIGHT - \nNine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming in the center of the first row.  The men, variously with mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them. \nAs camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room.  It is 1:30 at night.  Desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall. Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, at which twenty diners have finished their meals.  The eleven remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies. \nPHOTOGRAPHER That's all.  Thank you. \nThe photographic subjects rise. \nKANE (a sudden thought) Make up an extra copy and mail it to the \"Chronicle.\" \nChuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the head of the table.  The others have already sat down.  Kane gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife. \nKANE Gentlemen of the \"Enquirer\"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - (indicates the eight men) Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the \"Enquirer's\" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark. \nBERNSTEIN Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven. \nGeneral applause. \nKANE All of you - new and old -  You're all getting the best salaries in town.  Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. It's your talent I'm interested in.  That talent that's going to make the \"Enquirer\" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world! \nApplause. \nKANE However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night.  There are other subjects in the world. \nHe puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill whistle.  This is a signal.  A band strikes up a lively ditty of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the chorus costumes of the day.  The rest of this episode will be planned and staged later.  Its essence is that Kane is just a healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time. \nAs some of the girls are detached from the line and made into partners for individual dancing - \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nTHE \"ENQUIRER\" SIGN:  THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST CIRCULATION 274,321 \nDissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street scene.  There is a new sign on the side of the building below. It reads: \nREAD THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD \nCamera continues panning as we \nDISSOLVE: \nA montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900. \nThe scenes indicate the growth of the \"Enquirer\" under the impulse of Kane's personal drive.  Kane is shown, thus, at various activities: \nMove down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER  GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-  A torchlight parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the saloon - the sound of brass band playing \"It's a Hot Time.\" In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster \"REMEMBER THE MAINE\" \nINSERT:  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the parade above, in which \"Our Boys\" in the expeditionary hats are seen marching off to war. \nBack of observation car.  Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without flickering). \nThe wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of \"Enquirers\" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate that it is going like a bat out of hell.  A reproduction of Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the frame and almost hogs the entire front page.  The headline indicates the surrender of Cuba. \nINT. ENQUIRER OFFICE \nCartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most gruesome and recognizable - \"Capitalistic Greed.\"  This cartoon is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand Kane and the artist himself.  Kane is grinning over some suggestion he has made. \nDISSOLVE: \nThe cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of the \"Enquirer\" - in quite close, with an editorial and several faces of caps shown underneath.  The entire newspaper is crushed with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is pouring. \n", "test2_id": 1597, "test3_input": "The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling over the side.  Kane rushes to her. \nKANE Get Dr. Corey. \nRAYMOND Yes, sir. \nHe rushes out.  Susan is breathing, but heavily.  Kane loosens the lace collar at her throat. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. SUSAN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT - \nA little later.  All the lights are lit.  Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep.  Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him.  Dr. Corey rises. \nDR. COREY She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane. \nKane nods.  He has a small bottle in his hand. \nDR. COREY The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning. \nKANE Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her. \nDR. COREY I'm sure that's it. (he starts out) \nKANE There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there? \nDR. COREY Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too. \nKANE Of course. \nDr. Corey leaves.  Kane settles himself in a chair next to the bed, looking at Susan.  In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. SUSAN'S ROOM - DAY - \nSusan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed. Kane is in the chair beside her.  The nurse is out of the room. \nSUSAN (in a voice that comes from far away) I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again.  You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know...  They don't want you.  They just - \nKANE (angrily) That's when you've got to fight them.  That's when you've got to make them.  That's - \nSusan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic eyes. \nKANE I'm sorry. (he leans over to pat her hand) You won't have to fight them anymore. (he smiles a little) It's their loss. \nGratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over to cover his. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF XANADU - HALF BUILT \nINT. THE GRAND HALL IN XANADU - \nCloseup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle.  A hand is putting in the last piece.  Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle spread out on the floor. \nSusan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle.  Kane is in an easy chair.  Behind them towers the massive Renaissance fireplace.  It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the scene. \nSUSAN (with a sigh) What time is it? \nThere is no answer. \nSUSAN Charlie!  I said, what time is it? \nKANE (looks up - consults his watch) Half past eleven. \nSUSAN I mean in New York. \nKANE Half past eleven. \nSUSAN At night? \nKANE Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press. \nSUSAN (sarcastically) Hurray for the bulldog! (sighs) Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world. \nKANE You always said you wanted to live in a palace. \nSUSAN Can't we go back, Charlie? \nKane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work. \nSUSAN Charlie - \nThere is no answer. \nSUSAN If I promise to be a good girl! Not to drink - and to entertain all the governors and the senators with dignity - (she puts a slur into the word) Charlie - \nThere is still no answer. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nAnother picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece. \n", "test3_true": "Another picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. XANADU - LIVING ROOM - DAY - \nAnother picture puzzle. \nCamera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same positions as before, except that they are older. \nKANE One thing I've never been able to understand, Susan.  How do you know you haven't done them before? \nSusan shoots him an angry glance.  She isn't amused. \nSUSAN It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses. \nKANE You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - \nSUSAN (snapping) It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it. \nKANE I was referring to myself. (pauses) I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. Invite everybody to go to the Everglades - \nSUSAN (throws down a piece of the jigsaw puzzle and rises) Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is? \nKane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely. \nKANE I thought we might invite everybody to go on a picnic tomorrow.  Stay at Everglades overnight. (he pats her lightly on the shoulder) Please see that the arrangements are made, Susan. \nKane turns away - to Bernstein. \nKANE You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein. \nOn the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue: \nBERNSTEIN'S VOICE (embarrased) Oh, yes.  How do you do, Mr. Kane? \nCHARLIE JR.'S VOICE Hello. \nDuring this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face.  She is very angry. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. THE EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT - \nLong shot - of a number of classy tents. \nDISSOLVE OUT: \nDISSOLVE IN: \nINT. LARGE TENT - EVERGLADES CAMP - NIGHT - \nTwo real beds have been set up on each side of the tent.  A rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is preparing for bed.  Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy chair, reading.  Susan is very sullen. \nSUSAN I'm not going to put up with it. \nKane turns to look at her. \nSUSAN I mean it. (she catches a slight flicker on Kane's face) Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so don't do what I say I'm going to - but - \nKANE (interrupting) You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice. \nSUSAN I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - (in a rage) - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right - \nKANE (quickly) I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan. \nSUSAN Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do! \nKANE (gently) You're my wife, Susan, and - \nSUSAN I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be. I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was. \nKANE We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now - \nSUSAN I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it. \nKANE As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want. \nSUSAN What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me.  But you've never given me anything that - \nKANE Susan, I really think - \nSUSAN Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything.  You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about. \nKANE (he has risen) Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now! \nSUSAN Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. (she screams) You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're - (a sudden notion) - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them! \nKANE Susan! \nShe looks at him, with no lessening of her passion. \nKANE You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. (quietly) Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you. \n", "test3_id": 1598}

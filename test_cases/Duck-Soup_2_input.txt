BOB I object!...  we have no right to discuss this matter in the absence of my father. 
SPEAKER (To House) We have been meeting every morning for eight days and not once has His Excellency been on time... 
TRENTINO (Looking at his watch) Gentlemen, I cannot wait much longer... 
SPEAKER (To Bob) Would you mind calling your father again? 
Bob presses a button, either on desk or wall... 
CUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's pole.  The sound of the clanging bell is heard over scene. 
Groucho hurries into scene, fully clad but for his coat which he has on his arm... without waiting to don his coat he slides down the pole.  We pick him up finishing the slide down the pole into the House of Representatives.  As he arrives the members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the national anthem. 
MEMBERS (Singing) HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the brave and free... 
Groucho hurries toward Speaker's desk, putting on his coat as he goes...  Just as he reaches the desk the singing subsides.  Groucho turns to the body of men and looks off in the direction of one of the representatives. 
GROUCHO (Pointing toward the individual off scene) The Secretary of Agriculture was a little flat... (He takes a match and scratches it across the top of the desk to light his cigar... takes a few puffs, then raps the gavel.) I move we open the morning session... Has anybody got a cork screw? (Looking out and around at members)

GROUCHO What's to stop you from digging one... And after you dig a river, how're ya gonna cross it without a bridge...? We've got to have a bridge to stop people from going places -- then we've gotta stop them from coming back.  If you're worried about the expense we can have a bridge with only one end -- and if that's a success we can do away with it altogether. I'm telling you that what this country needs is -- 
Off scene we hear Chico's voice singing "P-E-A-N-U-T-S"... this is followed by the piping of a whistle playing the first strain of the PEANUT VENDOR... 
Groucho listens, annoyed and then continues 
GROUCHO If there's one thing we don't need right now -- it's peanuts -- gentlemen, what good is a bridge if you haven't got ammunition to blow it up... ammunition was never cheaper...  Right now, you can get two cannons for the price of one and shoot twice as far for half the money...  With every five thousand dollar purchase we throw in a Big Bertha... If you don't like her, you can throw her right out again.  I tell you no country can protect itself without -- 
Again Chico's voice comes over scene singing "P-E-A-N-U-T- S"...  The whistling of the first strain of song - the PEANUT VENDOR is heard again 
SPEAKER I'm sorry your Excellency, it is that infernal peanut vendor Chicolini... How can we accomplish anything with that constant annoyance? 
TRENTINO Your Excellency - are we or are we not going to discuss this problem - my time is valuable - I'm a man of few words - 
GROUCHO I'm a man of one word... SCRAM!!! 
Trentino exits resentfully 
GROUCHO (To Bob - aroused) Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts. 
BOB I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go - 
GROUCHO He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.

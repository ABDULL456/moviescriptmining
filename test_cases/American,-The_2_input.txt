They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER. 
WAITER Buona sera. Desidera? 
CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and moves. 
121   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                                  121 
JACK   and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth. They   look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his. They   say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging with   other couples. 
122   EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT                                       122 
The coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK is the oldest person there. 
The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae. CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl. She's a bit drunk. 
CLARA Woooow! 
She eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her pleasure. 
JACK How is it? 
CLARA Bitchin'. 
JACK (amused) Bitchin'? 
CLARA It's- come se dice- `slang', no? Eco. 
She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce and holds it out to JACK. 
JACK No thanks. 
CLARA Come on, Eduardo! 
He hesitates. He eats. 
CLARA It is good, you will agree? 
JACK (his mouth full) I will agree. 
CLARA (sensing his teasing) My English is nice! 
JACK It's bitchin'. 
CLARA (defending herself) You know how to swear in Italian? 
JACK Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile. 
CLARA "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia merde e morte: tuo cazzo un brufolo. 
JACK Eat shit and die, pimple dick? 
CLARA hiccups. 
CLARA Perdone! 
JACK I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts. 
CLARA Shell-tered? 
JACK Too much work. 
CLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but the screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of her handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone. 
CLARA Too much work. 
She turns the phone to silent. And looks up at JACK. 
CLARA I don't apologise, Eduardo. 
JACK For what? 
CLARA For this I do. My job. 
JACK Never apologise. 
He means it. 
A beat. 
CLARA Except this job is full of testa di cazzo. 
JACK Mine too. 
CLARA Lei? 
JACK Si. 
CLARA But you are too young to... pensione? 
JACK Retire. 
CLARA Si. 
JACK Liar. 
CLARA No! 
JACK Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client? 
He's put CLARA on the spot. 
JACK Am I a client? 
CLARA takes a deep breath. 
CLARA This say yes. 
She points at her head. 
CLARA This...

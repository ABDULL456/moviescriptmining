INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT 
The Camerlengo has just passed on the shocking news, and the whispered word "murder" can be heard in several languages. 
Even Mortati is shaken.   The Camerlengo speaks to the Cardinals. 
CAMERLENGO Please... a moment... if I... 
He strides quickly up the steps of the altar to address the group -- again, to the shock and surprise of this most conservative and rule-bound group. 
But no one stops him. 
CAMERLENGO   (cont'd) It is true we are under attack from an old enemy.    And this time they've struck from within, murdering our Holy Father and threatening us all with destruction at the hands of their new god, science.    So what are we to do? 
INT      OLIVETTI'S CAR      NIGHT 
CLOSE ON the dashboard clock in Olivetti's car, which now reads 8:57.    Langdon looks up from it, staring intently through the windshield. 
On the horizon, he sees a faint orange glow. 
LANGDON Oh no. 
INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT 
The Camerlengo continues, and the cardinals are listening. 
CAMERLENGO Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent intention.    Still, they call us backward, ignorant. 
CAMERLENGO   (cont'd) But who is more ignorant?   The man who cannot define lightning, or the man who does not respect its awesome power? 
INT      OLIVETTI'S CAR      NIGHT 
Through the windshield of Olivetti's car, we see that orange glow, closer now.    It's a building on fire. 
INT      SISTINE CHAPEL      NIGHT 
The Camerlengo continues, growing passionate. 
CAMERLENGO The promises of science have not been kept.    We're a fractured and frantic species, moving down of destruction in the name of progress. 
EXT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT 
The police cars come to an abrupt stop in front of the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.    Flames glow like evil eyes through the stained-glass windows fifty feet above the ground. 
A small CROWD has gathered, stabbing at their cell phones.    A SIREN WAILS in the distance. 
INT      SISTINE CHAPEL      NIGHT 
Mortati's Aide, Father Simeon, takes advantage of the open Sistine Chapel doors and slips inside.    He takes a place just behind Mortati as the Camerlengo goes on. 
CAMERLENGO Science and religion are not enemies. But there are things that science is simply too young to understand.    We are here to lead, but how? 
EXT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT 
With three sharp CRACKS, Olivetti fires into the lock in the front door of the church.    He KICKS it open -- 
-- and flame RIPS out into the night air. 
INT      SISTINE CHAPEL      NIGHT 
The Camerlengo speaks faster now: 
CAMERLENGO Shall we cloak ourselves in silence and secrecy, as in the past?    Or do we open the doors, take down the blackened curtains, and speak to our flock? 
INT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT 
Olivetti, Langdon, and four other VATICAN POLICE make their way into the burning church.    There is a massive pile of church pews in the center aisle, burning wildly. 
INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT 
The Camerlengo's wrapping up: 
CAMERLENGO Signores, I ask, no, I pray that you break this conclave.    Open the doors. 
INT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT 
In the burning church, two heavy incensor cables run from the walls of the church and rise above the burning pews at an angle, strung tightly to a center point.    Langdon follows the wires up with his eyes -- 
INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT 
CAMERLENGO Evacuate St. Peter's Square. 
INT     BURNING CHURCH       NIGHT 
-- the wires meet at a center point, just above the roaring flames, where -- 
INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT 
CAMERLENGO Tell the world the truth. 
INT      BURNING CHURCH     NIGHT 
-- the third cardinal, still alive, is suspended over the searing flames. 
A word is branded into the center of his bared chest: 
FIRE. 
Vatican Police, led by Olivetti and Vincenzo, race into the building and draw their weapons.    Olivetti SHOUTS to them in Italian, looking for a way to cut down the agonized cardinal. 
Langdon races toward the pyre, but is repelled by a wall of heat ten feet away.

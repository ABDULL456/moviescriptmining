TV plays across Chris' drunken face. He lays on the sofa, a beer on his chest. JEFF is sprawled in a chair. 
JEFF Some people ain't worth fighting for. 
CHRIS But she was right... 
JEFF (closing his eyes) A job is a job. At least we're outside. 
Chris is bleary, lost and drifting to sleep. The images on the TV don't immediately register but-- 
NEWS FOOTAGE of the WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING (1993) plays on TV. An explosion has demolished the garage. 
NEWS ANCHOR (OS) --group of radical militants called Al- Qaeda are taking credit for a bombing that left six dead and hundreds injured-- 
American flags at half mast. His chest rises and falls-- 
CHRIS Jeff, wake up. Look at this-- 
The faces of INNOCENT VICTIMS play across the screen. Chris' injured hand slowly curls into a fist. 
CHRIS Look what they did... 
19   INT. NAVY RECRUITING OFFICE                                19 
Posters of destroyers on walls. The NAVY RECRUITER is lean and shrewd. 
CHRIS I saw what they did, on our soil, and-- 
NAVY RECRUITER And you're from Texas and you're a patriot so it pissed you off. 
CHRIS Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight-- 
NAVY RECRUITER You wanna fight? Meet the warrior elite. 
He slides him a brochure-- "NAVY SEALS" emerge from the water, armed and bound for glory. 
CHRIS KYLE SEALs? 
NAVY RECRUITER Sea, Air and Land. 
CHRIS I ain't much of a swimmer-- 
NAVY RECRUITER (taking brochure back) This isn't for the faint of heart. Most men wash-out. They quit-- 
CHRIS (cutting him off) I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.

22   EXT. NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE CENTER / "THE GRINDER" - DAY     22 
CHRIS and 50 OTHER CANDIDATES lay on their backs doing flutter-kicks on a patch of blacktop surrounded by beige buildings. INSTRUCTORS wield hoses. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE (sprays Chris in the face) You a quitter, boy? 
CHRIS KYLE No, sir! 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Bullshit, you are fleet-meat. Don't turn away. Look up and take it. You're old as fuck. Did you join the Navy cause you had such a good time on Noah's Arc? How old are you? 
CHRIS 30, sir. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE 30! You fart dust and could've fathered half these boys. You think cause you had a pop-gun back in Texas you're cut out to be a SEAL? 
CHRIS No, sir. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE No, you're not cut out to be one? 
Chris is twisted in agony and clearly dislikes the water. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE What kind of asshole joins the Navy but hates the water. 
CHRIS I love water, hooyah. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE My ass you do. 
A CANDIDATE chokes a giggle. Rolle wheels around on-- 
RYAN JOB(24), a goofy, overweight Oregon kid who looks like he should be taking orders at a drive-thru window. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Is that you giggling you fat fuck? Look at you. You're so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World. Your momma fat too? 
RYAN No sir, she's not. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. What the fuck are you doing here fatboy? Do your feet get wet when you shower? When's the last time you saw your pecker? You're not a Seal, you're a fuckin Walrus. A big giggling Walrus. "Biggles" that's your new name-- 
"BIGGLES" is choking, coughing, struggling. ROLLE points to A BRASS BELL mounted on the back of a truck. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE --and that's your ticket home. Just drag your jelly-roll ass up and ring it and you'll be headed home to momma Shamu. 
BIGGLES is beaten, legs giving out, ready to quit when-- 
CHRIS (OC) (draws Rolle off Biggles) Two hundred. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE (whirls around, hosing) Did I ask you to count?

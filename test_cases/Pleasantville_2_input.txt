DAVID Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... 
MARGARET Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes. 
She giggles. David looks at her in amazement. 
MARGARET (CONT) Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean. 
DAVID Yeah. 
MARGARET What's that like? 
DAVID Well it's big. And it's blue ... (as if realizing it for the first time) ... It's really really blue. 
MARGARET Mmmm. (beat) Boy. It's hot up here. 
Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts. She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it. 
MARGARET (CONT) You want some berries? 
DAVID Hunh? 
She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES. 
MARGARET I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. (eating one) Mmm. So sweet. 
DAVID (looking at them) They just grow like that? 
MARGARET (looking straight up) Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you. 
She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ... 
MARGARET (CONT) Here. 
CLOSER. 
Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the moonlight. 
ANGLE. DAVID. 
He hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a whisper. 
MARGARET Go on. Try it. 
HIS POV. 
She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David reaches out and takes it. 
WIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET. 
For this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT. 
George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache case as he turns and heads up his front walk. 
INT. FOYER. 
George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly greeting: 
GEORGE Honey--I'm home. 
There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles as he calls out again: 
GEORGE (CONT) Honey--I'm home ... 
There is more silence. George looks around a little confused when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ... 
CUT TO: 
INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT. 
Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel, painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ... 
CLOSER. 
She looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER BOOM ... 
ANGLE. WINDOW. 
The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the chair and crosses to the window looking out. 
BETTY (frightened) What is that? 
MR. JOHNSON I don't know. 
Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide. 
REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING. 
It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime. There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER. 
WIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON. 
She looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing it, moves slightly closer. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. 
David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in the sky. 
MARGARET What is that? 
ANGLE. DAVID. 
He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks to him in terror. 
MARGARET What's going on?

HAWK Fettucini con Funghi Porcini. 
WAITER Bellissimo, signor. 
HAWK Oh, and could I have some ketchup with that. 
Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads. 
EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT 
At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp, Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads butter over an entire baguette. 
SNICKERS Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French..... 
ALMOND JOY Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference. 
The Waiter sneaks off.  Butterfinger devours his bread. 
SNICKERS Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos." 
ALMOND JOY Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement.... 
SNICKERS Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love. 
They look off to.... 
HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE 
Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  Hawk nabs it. 
HAWK This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh... 
ANNA Prison? 
HAWK I was the Warden? 
ANNA How long were you in? 
HAWK Let's just say, I never saw E.T. 
ANNA Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners. 
HAWK I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please.... 
WAITER Ah, anything for dessert? 
ANNA (she shoots) Yes.  Something to go. 
HAWK (she scores) I'll bring the ketchup. 
INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT 
The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his bruises. 
ANNA What have you been doing? 
HAWK Uh....old badminton injury. 
Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops herself and opts for tickling. 
HAWK tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES. 
ANNA (not stopping) Oh, I'm so sorry... 
Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor. Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes her eyes and arches her back..... 
She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk and stands up, trying to brush off her sins. 
ANNA I'm sorry.  I can't.  I.... 
HAWK (softly approaching) Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky. 
ANNA It's also been a long time for me.  I--

A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the outskirts of the city appear. 
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT 
The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter collects his coat and briefcase from the rack. 
EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT 
The street is fairly deserted. 
Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite. 
INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT 
A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper. 
Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN comes to serve him. 
CARTER Pint of bitter. 
The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him. 
CARTER In a thin glass. 
The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a thin glass and puts it on the counter. 
A telephone rings. The second barman answers it. 
BARMAN Is there a Mr Carter in the room? 
CARTER Yes. 
Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the receiver. 
CARTER Hello? (pause) Margaret? (pause) Why the hell aren't you here? (he lights a cigarette.) What time? (pause) Is Doreen at the house? (pause) Who's with him then? (pause) When can I see you? Will you be there tomorrow? (pause) Now listen, Margaret... 
The line goes dead. Carter hangs up. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT 
A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs the stairs. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT 
Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits an unseen bucket with depressing regularity. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking up. They see him and quickly drive off. 
Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Pitch black. 
An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his skin made-up, like porcelain. 
Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. 
Darkness returns. 
INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 
The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind.

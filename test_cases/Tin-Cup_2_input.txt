Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed. 
TIN CUP The therapist laughs at her patient? Is that how it works? A man is laid bare before God and he's the butt of the cosmic joke? 
MOLLY I'm sorry, I just... 
TIN CUP Some of this shit might actually 
work, y'know... I mean I think there's something to this hat with the pendulum golf ball thing... may be on to something here... 
MOLLY Oh, Roy, Jesus... Quoting yourself, 'It is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls.' 
Tin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he loses his defensiveness. 
TIN CUP Well, God damn... a lost and desperate soul stands before you. (beat) I assume I have the confidentiality of doctor-client privilege in regards to this outfit? 
MOLLY Of course you do. What happened? 
TIN CUP I got the shanks. 
MOLLY Are you taking penicillin? 
TIN CUP It can't be treated! It's much worse than whatever you thought it was. (beat) There's a glitch in my swing. 
MOLLY So it's in Romeo's department? 
TIN CUP He thinks it's your department -- says it's a head thing. 
MOLLY Oh. Well. I just came over to congratulate you on the regionals and return your car -- David says he doesn't want it, just wanted to make a point with you -- (beat) But I suppose we could have a therapy session right here and now 
TIN CUP I don't want therapy. I want you. 
MOLLY Roy...   I gotta get some air -- 
TIN CUP Look at me -- (considering what that means) Well, not right at the moment -- but listen to me. You're with the wrong guy. I'm the right guy. Everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum 'cause I've been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it's also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people. (beat) Such is life. So dump that phony bastard and come to the Open in my corner -- you can delay your romantic urges, which I know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess -- until the appropriate time... (beat) Tell me you're not at least moderately attracted to me. 
Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows -- for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks. 
MOLLY You have moments. 
TIN CUP Tell me which ones are my moments and I'll try to duplicate them. 
MOLLY This is a moment. You look great. 
TIN CUP Now?! 
MOLLY Utterly exposed, completely vulnerable, the inner child trying to get out. 
TIN CUP My inner child needs spanking. 
MOLLY You always liked that part about saddling up, the smell of leather 
TIN CUP C'mon, let's have a drink. Call it therapy. Charge me 75 an hour. Little Cuervo, little Freud... 
She's thinking about it. 
MOLLY Naw... I gotta go. (turns to leave) Oh, I don't have a car, I need a ride. 
CUT TO: 
83   EXT. ALONG RIVER BACK TO TOWN - DAY                       83 
Tin Cup and Molly in his convertible.   He works on her without pushing too hard. 
TIN CUP I know a spot along the river's great to watch the sunset? 
MOLLY Not tonight. 
TIN CUP 'Not tonight' means maybe some other night? 
MOLLY I didn't mean it like that. 
TIN CUP Consciously you didn't mean it like that -- but how about unconsciously, you're the expert, did you mean it unconsciously? 
MOLLY Unconsciously, Roy, I don't have a clue what I'm talking about. 
TIN CUP I feel we're making progress. 
MOLLY I do too. But I have no idea what it's progress towards... 
A84     EXT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DUSK                                 A84 
The Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new mall. She gets out. 
MOLLY Good luck in the Open, Roy. 
TIN CUP Put your money on me, Doc, the odds are fabulous and God knows I'm overdue... 
He drives away, and we stay: 
CLOSE ON MOLLY 
Watching Tin Cup careen away in his Caddy. 
CUT TO: 
84/85   EXT. SOUTHWESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY                            84/85 
The intrepid Winnebago on the way to the Open.    Romeo drives -- Tin Cup stares out the window.

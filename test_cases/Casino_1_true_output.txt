Through a windows of a motel room across the street from The Gold Rush, an FBI AGENT watches NICKY and MARINO exit the jewelry store, get into a parked car and rive away. 
IRIS OUT. 
FBI AGENT (O.S.) (Into a radio) Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with, uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie. 
ACE (V.O.) Nicky started out before me because it wasn't that easy... 
SWISH PAN TO THE FBI AGENT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW TALKING INTO A RADIO. 
ACE (V.O.) ...for him to get around anymore. 
FBI AGENT (Into radio) Okay, pulled out... 
SWISH PAN TO NICKY AND MARINO DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. 
FBI AGENT (O.S.) (Into radio) ...pretty fast. He's headed upstream. 
ACE (V.O.) Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing... 
SWISH PAN TO FBI CAR TRAILING BEHIND. 
ACE (V.O.) ...cars at least six times before he could shake all his tails. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #1 - DAY 
NICKY's car with MARINO driving pulls in; NICKY jumps out and gets in another car. 
ACE (V.O.) And because of all the planes, he had to use underground garages. 
MARINO drives off. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #2 - DAY 
NICKY's second car screeches in to another garage. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #3 - DAY 
NICKY hurries across the lot to another car. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #4 - DAY 
NICKY changes cars again. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #5 - DAY 
NICKY is running to yet another car. He drives off. 
EXT. DESERT SCENE - DAY 
A solitary ACE waiting in the vast desert, looking around. ACE looks at a sage brush and sand and a few rocks on the desert floor. This could be a hole meant for him. He steps away from it. 
ACE (V.O.) Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous. 
It's a scary place. I knew about the holes in the desert, of course, and everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 
Aerial shot of NICKY driving. 
ACE (V.O.) Normally, my prospects of comin' back alive from a meeting with Nicky were ninety-nine out of a hundred. But this time, when I heard him say, 'A couple a hundred yards down the road', I gave myself fifty-fifty. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
ACE still standing in the desert. NICKY's car suddenly appears as a reflection in ACE's sunglasses, shaking ACE out of his desert-induced reverie. NICKY's car pulls up by ACE. He gets out and storms up to him. 
NICKY Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head? 
ACE What people? 
NICKY What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out? 
ACE I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick. 
NICKY No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal! 
ACE I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem. 
NICKY You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?! 
ACE Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass. 
NICKY Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible! 
ACE I - 
NICKY (Interrupting) I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?! 
ACE What are you - 
NICKY (Interrupting) You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit! 
ACE I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on. 
NICKY Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV. 
ACE Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right. 
NICKY You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself. 
ACE Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you. 
NICKY Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it? 
ACE No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told... 
NICKY (Interrupting) Back - 
ACE ...you? Do you remember what I told you? 
NICKY Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you - 
ACE (Interrupting) You never - ? 
NICKY Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you! 
NICKY drives off, leaving an angry and frustrated ACE to ponder the desert and the holes. 
INT. JUBILATION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
Overhead of ACE, OSCAR, SHERBERT, TRUDY and showgirls walking down the zebra pattern carpet of the nightclub. They are escorted to their table. 
NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are seated at another table in the rear of the club so no one can hear their conversation. 
MARINO Well, we got company. 
ACE avoids looking at NICKY. 
NICKY Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to. 
DOMINICK Yeah. Fuck him. 
SHERBERT and the others make a toast. 
SHERBERT To Abraham Lincoln. 
ACE L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life'] 
SHERBERT Here we go. Good luck. 
NICKY watches ACE's entourage. 
DOMINICK Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you. 
NICKY Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem? 
MARINO Mm. 
NICKY Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they? 
MARINO They're havin' a good time too. 
NICKY So are we. 
NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are isolated and alone at their table. 
INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ACE sleeping. A hot line to the casino rings as a red light blinks. 
ACE (Into telephone) Yeah? 
INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT 
SHERBERT is calling ACE. 
SHERBERT (Quietly into telephone) Sam, we got a problem. 
INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ACE (Into telephone) What is it? 
SHERBERT (Over telephone) The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we... 
INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT 
SHERBERT (Into telephone) ...all turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was. He's over at the twenty-one table with his... 
INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT 
NICKY is betting every spot on the blackjack table. MARINO is standing behind him. The DEALER is nervous. 
SHERBERT ...nose wide open. He took the money out of his own kick. His nose is open for about ten thousand. 
SHERBERT and the pit boss look on. 
SHERBERT (O.S.) Now, he's really pissed. 
INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ACE (Into telephone) Oh, no. 
Sits up and throws off the bed covers. 
INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

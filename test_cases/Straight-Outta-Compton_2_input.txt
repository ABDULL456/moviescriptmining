The sound of FOOTSTEPS as Ren, Yella, Cube, and Eazy exit the bus, surround Dre. They can tell something is very wrong. 
YELLA Yo, Dre. What's goin' on? 
ON DRE as he forces back the tears that wanna come, his voice barely a whisper: 
DRE My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead. Somebody killed my little brother... 
Shocked: "What?" "Hell naw!" "What happen?" are heard amongst Cube, Eazy, Yella and Ren-- they crouch down next to Dre. Not sure what else to say or do. They wait for Dre to say more... 
DRE (CONT'D) He got into a fight near Leimert Park. A big mothafucka fell on top of him -- broke his neck. He killed Tyree. I can't believe this shit. 
Face buried in his hands, Dre quietly weeps. 
Jinx, Laylaw and DJ Speed gather in the front window of the bus. Not wanting to interrupt the group's moment. 
Cube rests a hand on Dre's shoulder as the others tighten the circle. There's silence... until: 
CUBE Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious-- 
EAZY Dope game took my cousin's life. I remember when they found him. 
DRE He shoulda been out here with me. If he was out here-- It never woulda happened... 
REN Or it could've happened in another way. Can't blame yourself, Dre... Life has to end for all of us, but love don't. Feel me? Tyree is always gonna be with you. No matter what. 
Eazy moves closer. Slowly, he places a hand on Dre's head. Rubs it. It's a bit startling -- Eazy's not one for tenderness. But it's clear he feels Dre's pain. 
EAZY Gonna be aiight, Dre... We with you. 
PULL BACK as the guys remain clustered around Dre. Looking so small, so vulnerable, crouched in front of the Bus, alone in the parking lot. NWA against the world. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE UP: ON; 
53   INT. MAUSOLEUM - LOS ANGELES - DAY                           53 
In a suit, Dre stands beside Tyree's MEMORIAL WALL, his arm draped around his heartbroken mother, Verna. She cries without end or apology, surrounded by family, including his other brother, WARREN G, plus Eazy, Cube, Ren and Yella. 
It's solemn and quiet. Dre remains stoic, staring hard, trying his best to remain strong for his mother. All members of the band keep a close eye on him, as the pastor wraps up his eulogy. 
PASTOR Death is a threshold we all have to pass through. No one is exempt. Tyree will set a place for us on the other side and we will see him again. The flesh will always return to the earth. But our spirits will live on forever. Amen! 
The congregation repeats the pastor with a follow up "Amen." 
54   INT. MAUSOLEUM - LATER                                       54 
A shattered Dre slumps out with his mom, Verna. 
DRE If I brung him out on tour with me, like he wanted -- 
VERNA This is not on you, Andre. 
Dre doesn't say anything. Keeps his head bowed. 
VERNA (CONT'D) Andre. 
DRE We was supposed to kick it... Next chance I got -- 
VERNA This is not your fault. Understand me? Stop this nonsense. Stop it now. 
He looks at his momma. This strong woman. 
VERNA (CONT'D) Your brother looked up to you. And you took great care of him. We both did. It's time to let someone else take care of him now. 
With that, she can no longer hold back the tears. Dre hugs her, mother and son comforting each other. 
VERNA (CONT'D) I'm proud of you... So proud of you, baby... 
Dre fights back tears of his own, the words he's longed to hear. As Verna slowly turns and walks away, Cube, Eazy, Ren and Yella surround him, brothers in arms. They walk out the Mausoleum.

BOW OF THE SHIP - DAY \nViking explorer LEIF ERICSON carefully studies his fob compass as he dangles it above a parchment map. His SAILORS steal nervous looks at a large, diabolical-looking IRON BOX in the hold. \nOLAF, a fierce, one-eyed Viking warrior approaches Ericson. NOTE: Dialog is in OLD NORSE, with SUBTITLES) \nOLAF Leif, let's do the deed before another night falls. The crew's near mutiny. \nEricson draws his broadsword with a flourish. \nLEIF ERICSON Know this! The first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts. \nOLAF But we've surely gone far enough. \nERICSON That accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world. We will go until we can go no more... \nSuddenly there is an ear-splitting SCREECH and the entire boat rocks violently as it runs aground. \nThe LOOKOUT is thrown from his crow's nest... and CRASHES straight through the deck right in front of Ericson. His pained voice floats up from the black hole. \nLOOKOUT ...Land ho. \nEricson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow. \nERICSON'S P.O.V. \nA beautiful rustic coastline stretching off as far as the eye can see. \nLEIF (GASPS) By Odin's beard... \nEXT. THE NEW WORLD - A HARBOR - SUNSET \nOlaf finishes digging a hole in the sand. He backs away, terrified, as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the IRON BOX over to the hole and quickly bury it. Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian WITCH. \nERICSON Be quick, Witch. Let the deed be done. \nThe Witch unravels a scroll and recites: \nWITCH Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief dwell now in waters, base and bland. And in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep... \nAs the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of clouds appears. The sky explodes in THUNDER and LIGHTNING. The MEN look about fearfully. \nERICSON (CONT.) Back to the ship men, hurry. \nOLAF Captain, you've discovered a new world. It is your right to name it. \nERICSON Leave that to the Italians. We're never coming back here. Never. This land is now cursed. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA SIGN: 'BEACH CLOSED - RAW SEWAGE - NO SWIMMING' \nEXT. BEACH - PRESENT DAY \nHot, smoggy and packed. Cityscape of towering skyscrapers stands in the haze just beyond the crowded beach. \nSUPER: EDGE CITY - THE PRESENT \nA caffeine-driven D.J's voice booms over the beach-goers' radios. \nD.J. (V.O.) Yessiree, it's a four-alarm sizzler out there today with highs in the upper nineties and no relief in sight. We have a third stage smog advisory and a metro traffic gridlock alert. Flourocarbons are up, the Dow Jones is down and we're expecting another Spike Lee movie any second. In other words folks, it's just another bee-youtiful day in Edge City. \nCamera ENDFRAMES on an industrial barge marked \"Department of Sanitation.\" A crane's cable line disappears underwater. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME \nSCUBA WELDERS repair a cracked, scum spewing pipe. One diver hits something hard with his dredger. He unearths... \nTHE ANCIENT IRON BOX \nRust and barnacles partially obscure the engraved images of Norse gods and demons. \nTHE DIVER wedges his scuba knife under the corroded lock. Erie 'MASK' theme SFX rise as he tries to pry open the lid. \nSuddenly the PIPELINE BREAKS FREE, crushing the diver and cracking open the box. \nSOMETHING (seen only in rippling shadow) explodes out of the box on a cloud of bubbles and shoots toward the surface. \n", "test1_true": "The Mask surfaces in the f.g. as lightening EXPLODES across the distant cityscape. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

EDGE CITY BANK \nCHARLIE SCHUMACHER (30's) gazes out the window from his cluttered desk as the crack of THUNDER echos through the urban canyons. \nCHARLIE Look at those clouds rollin' in, man. Freaky weather. \nSTANLEY IPKISS, a bright0eyed amiable young account exec pauses by Charlie's desk and drops off a print-out. \nSTANLEY Hey Charlie, can you go over these stats? We're supposed to have a complete report before lunch. \nCharlie takes one looks at the complex print-outs and tosses them back. \nCHARLIE Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had my weave tightened and my head is killing me. Be a pal and take those over to Hinkleman, will ya? \nMAGGIE, a cute young blonde now strolls by. \nMAGGIE Hi guys. Did you have any luck with those concert tickets Stanley? \nStanley perks up at the sight of her. \nSTANLEY I sure did. Friday night, just like you wanted. \nMAGGIE Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful. \nSTANLEY What time should I pick you up? \nMAGGIE Gee, I don't know. My best girlfriend just got into town and I know she'd love to go. Can we get an extra ticket for her? \nSTANLEY Well... uh, actually it's sold out. I was kinda lucky to get these. \nMAGGIE She's only going to be in town a couple of days and I just can't let her sit at home all alone. Are you sure there isn't something we can do? \nStanley considers the situation for a moment, then pulls the tickets out of his pocket. \nSTANLEY You know what? Here. You two go. \nMAGGIE Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that. \nSTANLEY No really. Go ahead. It's okay. I hate concerts anyway. All that, you know... music floating around. \nMaggie snatches the tickets from Stanley's hand. \nMAGGIE That is so sweet. Sheila's just going to love this. \nSTANLEY So maybe you and I can get together over the weekend? \nMAGGIE I'm not sure what's going on, but just give me a call. You know I like to be spontaneous. \nSTANLEY Oh, sure. Me too. \nMAGGIE Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest guy. \nMaggie gives him a quick air-kiss and hurries off to her teller's window. \nCHARLIE That's it. \nSTANLEY What? \nCHARLIE The kiss of death. As soon as they use the \"N\" word it's all over. \nSTANLEY So maybe I am a nice guy. So what? \nCHARLIE You are a rug. I am talking astro-turf here. You're letting these women sharpen their cleats on you. \nSTANLEY Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they can't appreciate that, it's their problem. \nCHARLIE You spend too much time being \"nice\" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves. \nSTANLEY Charlie, you are a very sick puppy. \nCHARLIE Wake up, Stanley! These are the nineties. We're dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies. You can't romance 'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's the only thing that gets their attention. (PAUSES) Let me demonstrate. You see that girl over there? \nStanley looks over at the coffee service where an attractive young WOMAN is pouring herself a cup of coffee. \nCHARLIE (CONT.) Hi Lisa. \nLISA (forgets his name) Oh, hi... \nCHARLIE Charlie. \nLISA That's right. Sorry. \nCHARLIE Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe you could settle it for us. \n", "test1_id": 3102, "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nEXT. RIVER - CULVERT - SUNSET \nThe Mask lies tangled in a rat's nest of seaweed and garbage that's washed up in a culvert under a bridge. \nA large WHARF RAT now creeps out along the garbage sniffing curiously at its timeworn wooden surface. It takes a tentative nibble. \nCLOSER - THE MASK \nbegins to SHIMMER... to vibrate with its own magical inner life. The rat SQUEAKS and jumps back, disturbing the pile of garbage. \nWIDER \nThe Mask is dislodged and floats back out into the river. Camera TILTS UP with the Mask as it follows the current into the dark heart of the city. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - EARLY EVENING \nStanley and Charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi cab. \nSTANLEY Hold it up right here, please. \nA gun port suddenly SLAMS open and the wild-eyed Albanian TAXI DRIVER wheels about and cocks a huge .45 from his side of the BULLET riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic. \nDRIVER Hold up?! No hold up! I keel you very well! I splatter your guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man! \nStanley dives for cover. \nCHARLIE No! No! He only wants you to stop the cab! \nThe driver instantly SLAMS on the brakes, throwing his passengers forward mercilessly. \nDRIVER (now totally calm) Hokay. Pardon you very much. \nCharlie helps Stanley sit back up. \nCHARLIE It's alright, Stanley. \nSTANLEY (SOFTLY) I hate this town. I really hate this town. \nCHARLIE Why are you getting out here? \nSTANLEY I gotta pick up my car. \nCHARLIE Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes. \nStanley steps out of the cab. \nSTANLEY Charlie, please. The last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers. \nCHARLIE Well, I can't promise we'll get that lucky again... Later! \nWith a SCREAM of tires the cab peels back out into traffic. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - EARLY EVENING \nStanley enters the grease spattered, cluttered garage and scans the area for signs of life. We can hear the CLANK-CLANK-CRASH of SOME less than light-fingered automotive work in progress. \nStanley DINGS a little service bell sitting on a counter plastered with naked playmate decoupage and Mrs. Power Tool '93 calendars. \nSTANLEY ...Hello? \nIRV, a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low- slung refrigerator repairman pants, makes his way past half rebuilt car carcasses towards Stanley. \nIRV Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your panties in a twist. \nBURT, a thinner version of Irv with Coke bottle glasses and a mop of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car, RIPS out of chunk of motor and wiring and holds it up to Irv. \nBURT (examining part) Hey Irv, what the hell is this? \nIRV (eyes it carefully) Ohh... I dunno. About seven hundred bucks. \nThey both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back. Irv makes his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself. \nIRV Now what can I do for you, Bub? \nSTANLEY I'm here for the Civic. \nIRV Japanese car, right? Kind of a nasty pea soup green? \nSTANLEY Well, they call it Emeral Forest, actually... \nIrv turns back to Burt. \nIRV Burt! Pea green Civic! \nBurt pops back up from beneath the hood. \nBURT Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh yeah! Brake drums are still on order and I'm only halfway through rebuilding the trans. \n", "test2_true": "IRV Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught those other problems before they caused some serious trouble. \nSTANLEY Alright. Alright. When will it be ready? \nIrv looks over at Burt, who gives him a \"Make something up\" look. \nIRV Come back tomorro... (Burt shakes his head \"no\".) ...First thing next wee... (Burt shakes again) ...next month? (Burt shakes an enthusiastic \"yes\".) Yeah, first thing next month. That's if we can get the parts. \nSTANLEY What am I going to do in the meantime? I can't afford to keep taking cabs all over town. \nIrv smiles a rotten-toothed smile. \nIRV Oh, hell... we can take care of that! (to Burt archly) Hey Burt, bring around the loaner. (to Stanley) And for you little buddy, only ten bucks a day. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT \nThe joint is jumping with musclehead BOUNCERS picking and choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy WANNABE'S gathered around the entrance. A light drizzle is falling. \nA parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as CAR HOPS scurry to keep up with the flow; \nA glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce. \nA fire engine red Ferrari. \nA classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy. \nAnd finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled Stanley behind the wheel. \nA car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops open with a SCREECH of metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street. \nHe smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood. \nSTANLEY It's a classic. \nThe car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who quickly push it off down the street. \nCHARLIE Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What is that, a Rolls Canardley? \nSTANLEY A what? \nCHARLIE You know, a Rolls Canardley. Rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next. (he cracks up) \nSTANLEY We are not discussing the car, okay? \nCHARLIE Whatever you say, man. \nCharlie gestures expansively towards the club. \nCHARLIE What do you think? Pretty terrific, huh? This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry. \nStanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing by the main entrance that reads \"Featuring the Musical Stylings of Miss Tina Carlyle.\" \nSTANLEY Hey, isn't that... \nCHARLIE Right. The wet dream from the bank. (PAUSES) Hold on... I think I see my future ex-wife. \nTwo rather tacky looking GIRLS beckon Charlie from the crowd. \nGIRLS Hey Charlie! Charlie! \nCHARLIE (WAVES) We're in luck. It's Barbie and Pebbles. \nSTANLEY Doesn't it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters? \nBarbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd. \nBARBIE We've been waiting out here for hours. Can you get us in? \nCHARLIE No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss. (leans closer) Stanley's very influential in the banking business. \nCharlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the crowd dragging his entourage with him. \nEXT. THE FRONT DOOR \nCharlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking BOUNCERS that guard the door. \nCHARLIE Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's happening man? \nBobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced ROCK STAR and his underage TARTLET past the ropes. \nCHARLIE (CONT.) (to the girls) This will just take a second. (to the other bouncer) Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie! \nNick is also completely oblivious. \nSTANLEY Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to stand here waiting to be judged by these power-mad steroid jockeys. \nCHARLIE How much cash you got on you? \nSTANLEY What? \n", "test2_id": 3103, "test3_input": "STANLEY \nputs one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back DOWN on his chair unconscious. \nStanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work. Not bad. Milo yips happily. \nSTANLEY Come on. \nStanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into Lt. Kellaway. \nKELLAWAY Ipkiss! \nStanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He points it at Kellaway with greater authority. \nSTANLEY Hold it! I warn you! I'm seriously stressed out here! \nKELLAWAY Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot. You're in the middle of a police station. There's no way you're just going to walk out of here. \nSTANLEY (PAUSES) You're right. \nStanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the Guard's gun. He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and begins to handcuff the two of them together. \nKELLAWAY Now what are you doing? \nSTANLEY Putting myself in your custody. \nKELLAWAY You are certifiable. \nStanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open. \nSTANLEY Milo! \nMilo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Okay. Now we have to hurry or we'll miss the party. \nKELLAWAY Of course. We wouldn't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit waiting. \nKeeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his jacket over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA- LATCH. \nSTANLEY Now move. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CASINO \nThe opening is in full swing as the limo and two sedans pull up to the front doors. \nCLOSER - LIMO \nas the CAR HOP attempts to open the passenger door, it EXPLODES off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car Hop with it. Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all his wicked green glory. \nDORIAN/MASK Don't be shy, Tina. I know how you like to make an entrance. \nHe pulls her out of the limo. \nDORIAN/MASK And I must say, that's a dress to die for. Or should I say in? \nDorian's men scramble, hauling the C-7 out of the limo and racing off into the darkness with their automatic weapons. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION \nLt. Kellaway and Stanley march past POLICEMEN, FELONS and CITIZENS in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as hell. Doyle waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate doughnut. \nDOYLE Hi Lieutenant. Where are you taking Ipkiss? \nKELLAWAY Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay... ouch! \nStanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun. \nDOYLE What did you say? \nMilo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley instantly pushes it back down. Doyle does a double-take wondering what's wrong with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out the door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten doughnut. \nDOYLE (CONT.) ...See ya. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASINO \nCAMERA BOOMS DOWN. The casino is a true Caesar's Palace style show place featuring a dragon-prowed Viking ship that's the CENTERPIECE of the room. The gaming floor is packed with happy PARTY GOERS. \nCAMERA ENDFRAMES on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off a passing WAITRESS' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it. \nCHARLIE Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful. One look at you and I know how your hat feels. \nSuddenly Mrs. Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with a paper bag filled with quarters. \nMRS. PEENMAN Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels lucky tonight. \nShe jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind Charlie and throws her weight behind the handle. \n", "test3_true": "as they suddenly EXPLODE inward, blowing Security Man off their feet. \nDorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after him.

CASINO \nThe frightened crowd mills about in terror as Dorian's thugs seal off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and jewelry. Orlando runs up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money. \nORLANDO We scored over half a mil from the safe! \nA SECURITY GUARD now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and opens fire on Dorian. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. \nOrlando dives for cover. The bullets seem to have no effect as Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it straight across the room with supernatural force. \nThe spear SKEWERS the Security Guard, sends him flying back and PINS him to a slot machine which immediately rings TILT and spills out quarters. \nDORIAN/MASK You can come out now, Orlando. I think he got the point. \nDorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring up boxes of C-7 and sticks of dynamite. He slams her up against the prow as his men lash her in place with coils of rope. \nTINA Let me go you bastard! \nDORIAN/MASK What's wrong darling? This is your big production number.

Oh, Arnie... \nSuddenly the entire table is lifted away as if it were a child's toy and they look up into the evil grinning of Dorian/Mask. \nDORIAN/MASK Swede... my dear, dear business partner. And Mayor Tilton! What a surprise. We have just enough time left to play my favorite game! \nINT. CASINO KITCHEN \nAs Stanley sneaks in an employee's door, the coast looks clear. He snaps off the kitchen lights. \nStanley spots a THUG standing guard outside the kitchen's double doors. He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea. The label on the barrel reads \"Olive Oil\". \nINT. CASINO \nThe Thug seems to be enjoying the mayhem when he hears an off camera WHISTLE.

{"train": "THE MASK \nWritten by \nMark Verheiden \nFINAL DRAFT \nEXT. HIGH SEAS - DAY \nThe dragonhead prow of an ancient Viking ship cuts through the thick fog of the rough North Atlantic Sea. \nMUSIC EXPLODES: WAGNER'S \"GOTTERDAMMERUNG\" (Twilight of the Gods) \nSUPERIMPOSE: THE TENTH CENTURY A.D. \nEXT. BOW OF THE SHIP - DAY \nViking explorer LEIF ERICSON carefully studies his fob compass as he dangles it above a parchment map. His SAILORS steal nervous looks at a large, diabolical-looking IRON BOX in the hold. \nOLAF, a fierce, one-eyed Viking warrior approaches Ericson. NOTE: Dialog is in OLD NORSE, with SUBTITLES) \nOLAF Leif, let's do the deed before another night falls. The crew's near mutiny. \nEricson draws his broadsword with a flourish. \nLEIF ERICSON Know this! The first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts. \nOLAF But we've surely gone far enough. \nERICSON That accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world. We will go until we can go no more... \nSuddenly there is an ear-splitting SCREECH and the entire boat rocks violently as it runs aground. \nThe LOOKOUT is thrown from his crow's nest... and CRASHES straight through the deck right in front of Ericson. His pained voice floats up from the black hole. \nLOOKOUT ...Land ho. \nEricson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow. \nERICSON'S P.O.V. \nA beautiful rustic coastline stretching off as far as the eye can see. \nLEIF (GASPS) By Odin's beard... \nEXT. THE NEW WORLD - A HARBOR - SUNSET \nOlaf finishes digging a hole in the sand. He backs away, terrified, as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the IRON BOX over to the hole and quickly bury it. Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian WITCH. \nERICSON Be quick, Witch. Let the deed be done. \nThe Witch unravels a scroll and recites: \nWITCH Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief dwell now in waters, base and bland. And in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep... \nAs the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of clouds appears. The sky explodes in THUNDER and LIGHTNING. The MEN look about fearfully. \nERICSON (CONT.) Back to the ship men, hurry. \nOLAF Captain, you've discovered a new world. It is your right to name it. \nERICSON Leave that to the Italians. We're never coming back here. Never. This land is now cursed. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA SIGN: 'BEACH CLOSED - RAW SEWAGE - NO SWIMMING' \nEXT. BEACH - PRESENT DAY \nHot, smoggy and packed. Cityscape of towering skyscrapers stands in the haze just beyond the crowded beach. \nSUPER: EDGE CITY - THE PRESENT \nA caffeine-driven D.J's voice booms over the beach-goers' radios. \nD.J. (V.O.) Yessiree, it's a four-alarm sizzler out there today with highs in the upper nineties and no relief in sight. We have a third stage smog advisory and a metro traffic gridlock alert. Flourocarbons are up, the Dow Jones is down and we're expecting another Spike Lee movie any second. In other words folks, it's just another bee-youtiful day in Edge City. \nCamera ENDFRAMES on an industrial barge marked \"Department of Sanitation.\" A crane's cable line disappears underwater. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME \nSCUBA WELDERS repair a cracked, scum spewing pipe. One diver hits something hard with his dredger. He unearths... \nTHE ANCIENT IRON BOX \nRust and barnacles partially obscure the engraved images of Norse gods and demons. \nTHE DIVER wedges his scuba knife under the corroded lock. Erie 'MASK' theme SFX rise as he tries to pry open the lid. \nSuddenly the PIPELINE BREAKS FREE, crushing the diver and cracking open the box. \nSOMETHING (seen only in rippling shadow) explodes out of the box on a cloud of bubbles and shoots toward the surface. \nLISA I'll help out if I can. \nCHARLIE (SHEEPISHLY) Actually, I don't know... this is kind of a personal question. \nLISA That's okay. Go ahead. \nCHARLIE Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man... am I the kind of guy you'd go out with? \nLISA Oh, um... I don't know. (PAUSES) Well... yeah. I guess I would. \nCHARLIE Lisa, I have terrific news for you. \nLISA What? \nCHARLIE I'm not married! Is this perfect or what? Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but... \nLisa SLAPS Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off. \nCHARLIE (CONT.) Jeez... make up your mind. \nStanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns. \nCHARLIE Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I'll tell you what Stanley, tonight I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle. \nSTANLEY And where's that? \nCHARLIE The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed. \nSTANLEY So how are we gonna get in? \nCHARLIE Woah, do I detect a little self-image problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town. \nSuddenly a resounding peal of THUNDER rings out like the crack of doom. Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows. \nEXT. STREET \nPedestrians scramble for cover in the sudden downpour. \nINT. BANK - FOYER \nA young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her head. She's soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten herself out. \nCharlie immediately notices her... \nCHARLIE Hold the phone. Killer at three o'clock. \nStanley follows his gaze. \nSTANLEY'S P.O.V. \nCAMERA does a classic CHEESECAKE TILT-UP starting with the woman's million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out of her skirt... up past her body, which through her damp summer clothes is undeniable proof that there is a God... up... up... to her face as that newspaper is tossed aside. She's a heart-stopping woman/child with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue eyes. In other words she's trouble. Big trouble, also known as TINA CARLYLE. \nCharlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe. \nCHARLIE (hushed reverence) Oh my god... A perfect dime. The dame of dames. The Moby of my dick. \nSTANLEY Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your eyes. \nTina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie. \nTINA Excuse me, where can I open a new account? \nCharlie flashes his best 100 watt smile. \nCHARLIE You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair... \nCharlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still preoccupied with her damp clothing. \nTINA Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete wreck. Will you hold this please? \nShe hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet blazer, creating another awe-inspiring visual moment. \nCHARLIE Here, let me take that for you. \nCharlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles. \nTINA Thanks. \nBut Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it. \nSTANLEY So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind? \nTINA (smiles sweetly) Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie Mr...? \nSTANLEY Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss... \nTina extends her hand. \nTINA Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you. \nSTANLEY The, uh... pleasure's all mine. \nTina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIVER - CULVERT - SUNSET \nThe Mask lies tangled in a rat's nest of seaweed and garbage that's washed up in a culvert under a bridge. \nA large WHARF RAT now creeps out along the garbage sniffing curiously at its timeworn wooden surface. It takes a tentative nibble. \nCLOSER - THE MASK \nbegins to SHIMMER... to vibrate with its own magical inner life. The rat SQUEAKS and jumps back, disturbing the pile of garbage. \nWIDER \nThe Mask is dislodged and floats back out into the river. Camera TILTS UP with the Mask as it follows the current into the dark heart of the city. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - EARLY EVENING \nStanley and Charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi cab. \nSTANLEY Hold it up right here, please. \nA gun port suddenly SLAMS open and the wild-eyed Albanian TAXI DRIVER wheels about and cocks a huge .45 from his side of the BULLET riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic. \nDRIVER Hold up?! No hold up! I keel you very well! I splatter your guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man! \nStanley dives for cover. \nCHARLIE No! No! He only wants you to stop the cab! \nThe driver instantly SLAMS on the brakes, throwing his passengers forward mercilessly. \nDRIVER (now totally calm) Hokay. Pardon you very much. \nCharlie helps Stanley sit back up. \nCHARLIE It's alright, Stanley. \nSTANLEY (SOFTLY) I hate this town. I really hate this town. \nCHARLIE Why are you getting out here? \nSTANLEY I gotta pick up my car. \nCHARLIE Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes. \nStanley steps out of the cab. \nSTANLEY Charlie, please. The last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers. \nCHARLIE Well, I can't promise we'll get that lucky again... Later! \nWith a SCREAM of tires the cab peels back out into traffic. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - EARLY EVENING \nStanley enters the grease spattered, cluttered garage and scans the area for signs of life. We can hear the CLANK-CLANK-CRASH of SOME less than light-fingered automotive work in progress. \nStanley DINGS a little service bell sitting on a counter plastered with naked playmate decoupage and Mrs. Power Tool '93 calendars. \nSTANLEY ...Hello? \nIRV, a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low- slung refrigerator repairman pants, makes his way past half rebuilt car carcasses towards Stanley. \nIRV Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your panties in a twist. \nBURT, a thinner version of Irv with Coke bottle glasses and a mop of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car, RIPS out of chunk of motor and wiring and holds it up to Irv. \nBURT (examining part) Hey Irv, what the hell is this? \nIRV (eyes it carefully) Ohh... I dunno. About seven hundred bucks. \nThey both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back. Irv makes his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself. \nIRV Now what can I do for you, Bub? \nSTANLEY I'm here for the Civic. \nIRV Japanese car, right? Kind of a nasty pea soup green? \nSTANLEY Well, they call it Emeral Forest, actually... \nIrv turns back to Burt. \nIRV Burt! Pea green Civic! \nBurt pops back up from beneath the hood. \nBURT Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh yeah! Brake drums are still on order and I'm only halfway through rebuilding the trans. \nCHARLIE You heard me. How much you got? \nSTANLEY I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks. \nCHARLIE Hand it over. \nSTANLEY No way. \nCHARLIE Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only carrying plastic. C'mon man, you want to stand out here all night? \nStanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash. Charlie snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the ropes. \nCHARLIE (subtly flashing bills) Hey Bobby! \nBobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up. \nBOBBY Charlie, how you doin' man? Long time no see. \nBobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he longs for. \nThe crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step by, briefly cutting Stanley off. \nHe catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed. \nSTANLEY Hey, wait a minute! Charlie! \nBut Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside. Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's list. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) I'm with them! Hey, Bobby! \nBut Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps the rope himself and starts throgh. Bobby and BOUNCER #2 IMMEDIATELY grab Stanley and quickly subdue him. \nSTANLEY Hey! Leggo... awk! \nDorian glares at Stanley. \nDORIAN Lose him. \nThe bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously toss him out into the rain-slick street. \nANGLE ON THE STREET \nStanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings into the club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water. \nStanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR carrying an umbrella. She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting a losing battle to restrain her decolletage. \nTheir EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him. \nTINA (SMILES) Oh... Stanley. Hi. \nStanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little wave hello anyway. \nTINA (CONT.) Are you okay? \nStanley gestures \"no problem\" and tries to strike a casual pose against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls. \nWith a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him. \nStanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the car hop's tip money... nothing. \nHe shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of NOXIOUS exhaust fumes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT \nA forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually pulls into sight on the dark rain-slick street. \nINT. CAR \nStanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies. \nEXT. BRIDGE \nSteam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely to restart the engine. \nFinally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly falls off with a resounding CLUNK. \nBeat. \nThe front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's side door CLATTERS to the ground. \nStanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless metal... his mind a complete blank. \nHe slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy sweeps over him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it drops down... down to the river below. \nSuddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Hey... Hey mister! \nEXT. RIVER BANK \nStanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and HURRIES as fast as he can. \nSTANLEY Thanks Officer. \nThe black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the empty street. \nVOICE Hey, mister... \nStanley turns. \nA razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in a darkened alleyway. \nDEATH'S HEAD You a cop or something? \nA half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation- AS-FASHION oddments. \nSTANLEY Uh... no. They just gave me a lift. \nDEATH'S HEAD A cop chauffeur? I never seen that before. How about you boys? \nThe other Death's Heads pipe up with \"Not Me,\" \"Nope,\" \"Pretty special,\" etc. as they slowly surround Stanley. \nSTANLEY Alright, you guys. It's been a tough night. I haven't got any money. I haven't got a car. All I have is this and you're welcome to it. \nStanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask. \nHe briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley. \nDEATH'S HEAD Hey, man. You got us all wrong. We don't want any trouble. I was just going to ask you for the time. That's all. You got the time? \nSTANLEY Uh... yeah. \nAs Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he slices straight through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch. \nDEATH'S HEAD (holding up his prize) See, I only wanted the time! Heh, he, heh... \nAll the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across to #3 and so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally breaks free and scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's Heads roar with laughter. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nStanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past - \nAPARTMENT \"A\" - MANAGER \nA sign that reads \"Quiet Please\" hangs from the doorknob. Stanley continues past it to Apartment \"B\". Just as he removes his keys - THE Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her relatives. \nMRS. PEENMAN Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is? \nReflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist. \nSTANLEY Actually, no. \nMRS. PEENMAN It's three o'clock in the morning! First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals. Then, you come in and start squeak - (sees puddles) My new carpet! Just look at that! This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss! \nStanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban shell-shock. \nSTANLEY (SOFTLY) Are you done? \nMRS. PEENMAN ...Yes. \nSTANLEY I think I'll be going to bed now. \nMrs. Peenman SLAMS her door. \nINT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES \nSmall, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks the door behind him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with a big heart. \nSTANLEY Hello, Milo. \nMilo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Easy, buddy. I missed you too. \nStanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and heads straight into... \nTHE BEDROOM \nStanley's prized collection of \"golden Age\" Looney Tunes tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf. \nHe tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his bed and starts to strip off his shoes and socks. \nMILO \nenters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) C'mon, Milo. I'm beat. (to the dog YIPS) Okay, okay. One throw. \nStanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails... \nOUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY \nMilo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap. \nTrying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as the Mask steps with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT \"A\" with it's little \"Quiet Please\" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the \"SHUSH\" sign. \nSuddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall. \nSTANLEY/MASK O, jeepers--! \nStanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his pocket and starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but those bells just keep ringing. \nThe hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers into the floor and reverberates through the building like THUNDERBOLTS. \nThe door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look at the Mask with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and SCREAMS bloody murder. \nThe Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror. \nMrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she appears cocking an enormous shotgun. \nMASK Easy lady! I was just killin' time! \nThe Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM. \nThe Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH. \nEXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street seven stories below. \nSTANLEY/MASK AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH- \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nSPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine turns a corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body. \nHe raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and straightens his zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve. \nSTANLEY/MASK Hey! You missed a spot! \nAs if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3- D by blowing into his thumb and hops up. \nSTANLEY/MASK And next time, no starch! \nFully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting like a prize fighter. \nVOICE Hey mister... \nDeath's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the Mask. \nDEATH'S HEAD #1 (grins evilly) ...You got the time? \nThe Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head punkers. He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that they see his face, they're totally freaked. \nMASK (wiggles eyebrows) Why of course, Cubbie. I got all the time in the world! \nHe whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon- style). It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING cuckoo clocks and sun dials. \nMASK London, Paris, Rome, standard, substandard and no standards at all! And for our English friends we have... Big Ben! \nDEATH'S HEAD #1 Big Ben? \nStanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the sidewalk. KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the corner. \nDEATH'S HEAD #2 Get him! \nThe Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around the corner into the alleyway. \nINT. ALLEY \nThey come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask dressed as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope music come from out of nowhere. \nMASK And for my next trick... \nLong pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into AN elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH. \nThe Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were no rocket scientists in the first place.) \nMASK (CONT.) And viola! We have a giraffe! \nSure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a little kid upon receiving it. \nThe Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting more balloons. SCREECH POP. \nMASK (CONT.) A few more twists of the wrist and for you, Cubbie. \nHe hands this next prize to Death's Head #3. \nMASK (CONT.) A French poodle! And finally my favorite... \nHe goes into another flurry of motion. \nE.C.U. - BALLOON \nAs the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens out and MORPHS into... \nMASK (CONT.) A Tommy gun! \nChralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the HEADLINE \"Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw.\" \nMR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than Stanley, now appears. \nDICKEY Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money! \nSTANLEY Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't happen again. \nDICKEY (snatches newspaper) If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here. \nCHARLIE Ah... She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir. \nDICKEY (sudden attitude change) She is? Well... Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office. \nSTANLEY Yes sir, Mr. Dickey. \nDickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off through the bank. \nCHARLIE Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money. \nStanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick \"kiss\". \nSTANLEY You think she ever will come back, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar. \nSTANLEY You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive. \nCHARLIE Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth... someone like... \nANGLE ACROSS THE BANK \nas Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and pretty in a blazer and jeans. \nPEGGY Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss? \nBACK TO CHARLIE \nCHARLIE Like her! Someone like her. (straightens tie) As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself. (rises as Peggy approaches) Hel-lo there. May I be of some assistance? \nPEGGY Stanley Ipkiss? \nCharlie begrudgingly points to Stanley. \nPEGGY (CONT.) Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with the Evening Star. \nSTANLEY Oh, hi. I already have a subscription, thanks. \nPEGGY Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions. \nSTANLEY Really? About what? \nPEGGY Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs aren't you? \nSTANLEY I... uh. No. I think you must have made a mistake. \nPeggy produces one of the complaint slips. \nPEGGY Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out? \nSTANLEY (nervous chuckle) Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have stopped in there once or twice, Miss... what did you say your name was? \nPEGGY Peggy Brandt. \nSTANLEY Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of \"Ask Peggy\"? \nPEGGY That's right. \nSTANLEY (brightens up) You printed my letter last year, remember? \"Nice Guys Finish Last.\" \nPEGGY You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you. \nSTANLEY Are you serious? \nPEGGY Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood. \nSTANLEY Why are you covering this story? \nPEGGY They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on \"Dear Peggy\" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me. (sits closer) Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob. I'm not out to get you. I just want the truth. \nSTANLEY I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really do. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MONKEY'S PAW ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON \nA well dressed MAN checks from beneath his sunglasses to see nobody's watching and RAPS on the door. It opens and he quickly DISAPPEARS inside. \nINT. DORIAN'S OFFICE \nSweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and Chun Woo are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out on the air hockey table. \nDORIAN Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of you to drop by. \nTHE MASK \nThrough his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme. \nSTANLEY \nstands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly siren song above the pounding drums. \nSTANLEY (SOFTLY) No... \nHe backs away from the window. \nE.C.U. - THE MASK \nshimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder. \nSTANLEY \ntakes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and finally loses control. He bolts from the room. \nEXT. BALCONY - NIGHT \nStanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow ledge. Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away and climbs out over the ledge. \nTHE LEDGE \nStanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then catches his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at the leering face. F.X. music THUNDERS in his head. \nTHE MASK (faint echos) Stanley... Stanley. \nStanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his prize. \nSTANLEY Just... one... last... time. \nHe lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time towards the mask. \nMILO \nwatches from the apratment window, whimpering softly. \nC.U. - THE LEDGE \nNarrow masonry begins to crumble. \nSTANLEY \ncarefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down below. \nTHE MASONRY \ncracks away. \nSTANLEY \nSCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face. \nINT. APARTMENT \nThe window suddenly EXPLODES inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask tornado bursts into the room. Milo dives for cover. \nThe tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then SCREECHES to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory. He strikes a grand entrance pose with his arms held high. \nMASK (SINGS) I gotta be me! I just gotta be me! \nHe ZZZIPS into the bathroom \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and blows her a kiss. \nMASK (a'la Big Bopper) Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what you likah! \nHe sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at once. \nHe ZZZIPS into the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM \nThe Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself out. With a magical \"hands are quicker than the eye\" move, he CHANGES wardrobe instantly... now posing in an effete fashion victim Don Johnson-style suit. \nMASK The G.Q. look?... Naw. \nIn a TWINKLING he's changed again: now in MTV Rapper-style over- sized jeans and backwards baseball cap. \nMASK (CONT.) 501's? (shakes his head) For buttonheads only. \nHe changes again in a flash... This time he's naked except for his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut washboard-style). \nMASK (CONT.) Marky Mark, eat your heart out. \nHe changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot suit complete with a snap brim fedora. That's the ticket! \nMASK (CONT.) S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see... \nBOBBY Er, uh... Are you on the list? \nTHE MASK No, but I believe my friends are. (fans a wad of cash) Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. \nHe tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club as the crowd scrambles for the cash. \nINT. MONKEY'S PAW \nThis is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical DECOR complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks. \nCAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite ringside table and removes the \"reserved\" sign. The lights dim an all eyes go to the bandstand. \nANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND \nA spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a gigantic fan revealing... \nTINA CARLYLE \nin a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would be arrested for disturbing the peace. \nShe talks/sings the intro of her number a capella. \nTINA There's all kinds of men In this old world That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl. \nBut of the men from Which to choose There's only one type That I... ap...aprooove. \nAnd now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina sings \"Checks Appeal\". She works the room throughout the song, driving the men crazy as she lingers by each table. \nTINA (CONT.) You can keep your cowboys on the farm The gigolos don't make me warm It's mink my fingers crave to feel I need a man with checks appeal. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina. \nHis eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with EACH beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished. \nTINA (CONT.) Pretty boys are such a bore There's manly macho types galore But you'll always know The diamond's real If you've got a man with checks appeal. \nThe Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint shaker. WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still. \nDORIAN'S TABLE \nSweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian. \nDORIAN What the hell are you doing here? \nEDDY We got trouble. You better come upstairs. \nDorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards his office. \nANGLE ON THE MASK \nas he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a wolf's. He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and stomps his foot on the floor. \nTINA Don't want to see too fanatic But dollar signs are so romantic I want a love That's deep and real Just with a man that's got... (big finish) Checks ap-peaaal. \nThe audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow. \nSuddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits him. \nTHE MASK Let's rock this joint! \nHe grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, BEATNIK BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE- WOOGIE. \nThe Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING out a driving rock 'n roll tune. \nSatisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into a wild special FX JITTERBUG. \nTHE CROWD \nwatches amazed as... \nTHE MASK AND TINA \nput Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS TINA beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat. \nTHE MASK S-s-s-smokin! \nCUT TO: \nINT. DORIAN'S OFFICE \nDorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound in his side. \nDORIAN What the hell happened to you? \nFREEZE I'll be okay. Nobody puts the chill on Freeze. \nDORIAN Where's the money? \nFREEZE Deal went south, Bro'. Someone else hit the place before we did. \nDORIAN Who? \nA hockey goalie bats the bullet away. \nA Russian Dancer leaps over the shot. \nA Cowboy DING! takes the hit. \nThe Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support. \nMASK Ak... you got me Pahdnuh. (cough... cough) \nEddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in his arms. \nMASK (CONT.) Hold me close, Red. It's a gettin' dark. (COUGH) Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out. (cough... cough) Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin' it home for Christmas. (COUGH) Tell Scarlet I do give a damn... I... I... UUG! \nAnd the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears. \nSuddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the foreground, applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into frame handing the Mask an Oscar. \nThe Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows. \nTHE MASK (CONT.) Thank you! You love me! You really love me! \nDorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire. \nThe Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance floor. \nDorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED OPEN and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with THEIR guns drawn. \nKELLAWAY Drop it, Tyrel! \nDorian lets his .45 CLATTER to the ground. Kellaway retrieves it. \nDORIAN Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap? \nKELLAWAY I got probable cause. A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank. \nOne of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian \nDORIAN Easy, junior. You're givin' me a woodey. \nKELLWAY One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask. \nDORIAN For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit. \nKELLAWAY This isn't harassment. You want to see some harassment? (to his men) Search the place, boys. \nHis men begin to tear the club apart. \nDORIAN Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole? I got friends so high up they'd give you a nose bleed. \nKellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right cross. \nKELLAWAY Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too. \nDorian shakes it off and glares at him. \nDORIAN (SOFTLY) You're a dead man. \nOne of the officers now appears on the stairway. \nOFFICER Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the guys from the heist. \nKELLAWAY (cuffs him) Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're comin' downtown. \nDORIAN I'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it. \nKELLAWAY Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little hospitality. (pats him on the cheek) I'll stop by to tuck you in myself. \nAs the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on the dance floor. \nCLOSER \nKellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric Kellaway saw Stalney wearing that morning. \nEXT. CLUB \nKellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the Mask. The eyes follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door. \nKELLAWAY You're on your own, boys. \nCOP Don't worry, Lt. If he's in there, well get him. \nKellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket. \nKELLAWAY And if he's not, I got a feeling I know where to find him. \nAs Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind unsuspecting policemen and around the corner to safety. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nMilo GROWLS, Frisbee in mouth. Stanley wakes up with a massive headache and dark rings under his eyes. The Mask, which lies on the pillow next to him is taking a greater and greater toll. There's a BANGING on the door. \nTINA You. You're losing it Dorian. \nDORIAN I'm losing nothing. Except maybe some extra baggage I don't need around here. \nTINA What's that supposed to mean? \nDORIAN You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night. \nTINA C'mon, did it look to you like I had a choice? \nDORIAN Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I know this, one day real soon I'm gonna run this town and when I do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me. (glares at her) I mean anyone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - DAY \nThe place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed with worried depositors. Stanley makes his way to his desk, his face pale and unshaven. Dark circles ring his eyes. \nMR. DICKEY Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late. If I have to put up with your slovenly... \nStanley develops an odd facial TWITCH, then... \nSTANLEY (EXPLODES) Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed! \nDickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, then... \nMR. DICKEY That will be all, Ipkiss. \nDickey turns on his heels and exits. Charlie Schumacher now appears glowing with new respect for Stanley. \nCHARLIE Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on? \nSTANLEY I'm not sure. (TWITCHES) I haven't exactly been myself lately. \nFor a split second, Stanley's entire face CONTORTS into an alarming Mask-like expression. \nCHARLIE (WARILY) Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy... and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets? \nSTANLEY I'm afraid to ask. \nCharlie flashes two tickets. \nCHARLIE Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say? \nSTANELY I don't know Charlie, I... \nStanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his desk. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Excuse me a second. \nANGLE ON STANLEY'S DESK \nSTANLEY Tina... What are you doing here? \nTINA I heard about the robbery. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay. \nSTANLEY Oh, don't worry about me. (TWITCHES) I'm fine. \nTINA Are you sure? You look a little... \nSTANLEY I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all. (BEAT) I guess you won't want to open that account after all this... \nTINA I'm not so sure I'll have much to open an account with anymore. \nSTANLEY What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great. \nTINA I don't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley. Things are getting a little intense. \nSTANLEY Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal... \nTINA I wish it was that easy. There's thousands of girls out there just like me who... \nSTANLEY Not just like you. You've got a voice like... like an angel. \nTINA (lights a cigarette) An angel huh? That's the first time I've heard that one. \nSTANLEY No, I mean it. You really do. \nTINA I can vamp my way through a tune. But that's not really singing. \nSTANLEY What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself? \nTINA (SIGHS) I guess I've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys. In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song. \nSTANLEY So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys. \nTINA I'm not so sure there's any other kind. Not for me, anyway. (RISES) Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt. \nSTANLEY Yeah. \nTINA What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him? \nSTANLEY I'm not sure. Why are you interested? \nPEGGY How do I find this Tyrel? \nFIGURE Careful, sweet meat. You break this story and he just might find you. \nCUT TO: \nC.U. DORIAN \nas he enters... \nEXT. JORGENSON'S SMORGASBORD - AFTERNOON \nDorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the restaurant's ersatz chalet facade. \nINT. SMORGASBORD \nSweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated SMORGASBORD \nThe Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he's served by a big blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume. \nSWEDE Dorian... thanks for coming by, kid. \nDORIAN My pleasure, Swede. It's been too long. I was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat. \nSWEDE That? It was nothing. He was a pain in my ass anyway. Here, sit down, sit down. \nDORIAN Congratulations on the new casino. \nSWEDE Thanks, but it might be a little early to celebrate. As a matter of fact that's why I asked you to stop by. \nDORIAN Is that right? \nSWEDE Here... have a little something to eat. That's Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing. \nDORIAN Thanks. \nDorian starts to eat. \nSWEDE So, I tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame. I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The whole deal could fold. \nDORIAN Maybe I can help you out. I'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out... \nSWEDE What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy a sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve this myself. \nDORIAN Is that right? \nSWEDE That's right. You know that Councilman you got in your pocket? \nDorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth. He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy. \nSWEDE (CONT.) Well now you've got 'im in your mouth. How you like that? \nThe Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin. \nSweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, jamming a barrel to his temple. \nSWEDE (CONT.) (to Dorian) Now listen close scumbag! You want to bw in business with me? Okay, we're partners now. I'm takin' fifty per cent off the Monkey's Paw. You screw with me again and I'll send you straight down to Hell with your scumbag councilman. You can apologize for eatin' him for lunch. \nDORIAN Sure, Swede. Take it easy. \nSWEDE Good. Now get out of my sight. \nDorian rises. \nSWEDE Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets to my grand opening. Stop by. And try to dress up nice. It's good for business. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON: NEWSPAPER HEADLINE \n\"The Mask Robs Bank - Police Scour The City.\" It's accompanied by a grainy blow-up of the Mask from the bank video. \nA HAND \njams a quarter in the slot, opens the machine and pulls out the entire stack of papers. \nWIDER \nto reveal Stanley, still looking pale and desperate as he dumps the entire stack of papers in a nearby garbage can. \nHe starts to turn away when he notices an ad on the back of the paper for a book... \"The Masks We Wear\" by Dr. Arthur Neuman, the SAME man we saw interviewed on \"The Larry King Show.\" The byline reads \"The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within Us.\" \nStanley rips out the ad and hurries off down the street. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nC.U. - MASKS... Dozens of them line one wall. Tribal masks. Victorian masks. Ceramic masks. Masks from all countries and cultures. \nWIDER \nStanley paces the plush office like a caged animal while Dr. Neuman sits nearby toying with his pipe. \nStanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out of this mess - then - \nSTANLEY/MASK Hit it! \nWith that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a pose, now wearing a straw hat \"boater\" and weilding a cane. \nPedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music. \nA FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song. \nFEMALE COP They rave about Sloppy Joe - the Latin lothario - but Havana - has a new sensation. \nIt's \"Cuban Pete RUMBA\" by Desi Arnaz! (Yes, this is a real song!) \nFEMALE COP (CONT.) He's really a modest guy - although he's the hottest guy - in HavAAAAna - and here's what he has to saaaay - \nStanley/Mask steps up to the \"stage\" and tilts the boater over his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd. \nSTANLEY/MASK (\"Latin\" voice) They call me Cuban Pete - I'm King of the Rumba beat - every time I play the maracas I go chick chick chickie boom! \nGene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively down a street lamp post, doing repeated \"splits\" on the sidewalk - it's his big number! \nThe cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment. \nANGLE ON STONE WALL \nKellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall. He can't believe his eyes. Doyle clamors up beside him. \nDOYLE Hey, he's not bad. \nKellaway shoots him a dirty look. \nSTANLEY/MASK \nwaltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily armed cops. His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then his upper torso SPINS until they're straightened out again. \nSTANLEY/MASK (still singing) Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze of my native street! When I start to dance everything goes chick chick chickie boom! \nLike some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits for the \"musical break\" to coax the armed cops into JOINING him on the number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS GIRLS! \nANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER \nThe street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat. \nEXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT \nKellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his tac squad, his friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this crazy maniac! \nStanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, \"dirty dancing\" her across the street - \nSTANLEY/MASK The senoritas they sing, and how they sling their sombreros --! (It's very nice! So full of SPIIIIICE--) (dip!) And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring to their vaqueros - they sing their song, all the day loonnnggg - \nDoyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the others, but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket. \nKELLAWAY You go out there and I'll blow your brains out! \nFurious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT AND stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the CHORUS line, looking confused. \nLT. KELLAWAY (CONT.) Goddamn it! Arrest that thing! \nThe cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons. \nTHROUGH THE SMOKE \nThe Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd. \nKELLAWAY \nspots the Mask and races after him, calling his men. \nKELLAWAY (CONT.) This way! \nTHE MASK \nbumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness. \nThe Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns around, the Mask has now transformed back into... \nSTANLEY \nCarrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd. \nKELLAWAY \nfollowed by a handfull of officers bears down on him. \nKELLAWAY Halt! Halt or we'll shoot! \nStanley quickly cuts down... \nA NARROW ALLEY \nStanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets EXPLODE all around him. Just as he reaches the next street... \nDorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy. \nDORIAN/MASK DO AS I SAY! I have other plans for Ipkiss. Everything's become so clear to me now! \nPeggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase. \nPEGGY Ah... excuse me. If you don't mind, I'll just take my money and be going. You guys make yourselves at home. \nDorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly. \nDORIAN/MASK Must you go? What a shame. You and I could make beautiful headlines together. \nPeggy removes his arm from her shoulder. \nPEGGY Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part of the deal. \nPeggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit. \nDORIAN/MASK Of course. You only want what's coming to you, don't you? \nPeggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat. \nPEGGY Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't born yesterday. \nDORIAN/MASK Ah... But you might die today! \nDorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a flash he snatches Peggy off her feet. \nDORIAN/MASK (CONT.) A girl like you deserves to have her face plastered all over page one. \nHe tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper. \nCAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers roll out on a conveyor belt. \nHeadlines in blood red ink now read: \"Reporter Killed in Freak Accident\" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking Peggy, her mouth open in a silent scream. \nSWEET EDDY What do we do with Ipkiss? \nDORIAN/MASK The police are looking for the Mask. We shall give them the Mask. And Eddy... \nSWEET EDDY Yeah, Dorian? \nDORIAN/MASK Get the boys ready. The Swedes' expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night. We wouldn't want to disappoint him, would we? \nDorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in RESPONSE and elbows the other thugs to join in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the curtains. They yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into plastic garbage bags. \nEXT. STREET - CAR \nStanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes his .45 under Stanley's nose. \nTHUG That money better be where you said it was, Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye. \nHe chuckles at his own little joke. \nINT. APARTMENT \nMilo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish their job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window. \nMILO'S P.O.V. \nof the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the car window. The henchmen pushes him back down. \nMILO \nHis ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside the curtain. \nTHE HENCHMEN \nfinish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo races right by them, just out of sight. \nEXT. STREET \nThe henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, DODGING pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nDejected, Lt. Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt. Doyle. \nLT. KELLAWAY I still can't believe it. Hardened cops dancin' in the streets... and broadcast all over the ten o'clock news. \nDOYLE The SWAT team got an offer to open for Wayne Newton. \nLT. KELLAWAY I'm history. The Captain's going to have my badge for breakfast. With a little pension on top. \nDOYLE C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your fault. Something will turn up. \nTINA (CONT.) --kiss. \nThey KISS. A sweet, soft and romantic kiss. Then... the KEY-GUARD pulls her away. \nKEY-GUARD Time's up, lady. \nTINA I've got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll go but I'll let you know as soon as I can. \nStanley takes a long last look at Tina as she's escorted out. \nEXT. STATION - DAY \nWarily, Tina slips out of the precinct. She's about to cross the street, but spots a SUSPICIOUS LIMO, engine idling. Quickly, she doubles back and heads - \nINTO THE ALLEY \nBehind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one's there. Tina hurries toward the next street and - \nA BIG SEDAN \nroars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her. \nSweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo. She SCREAMS. \nINT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME \nStanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo. Frantic, Stanley runs to the cell door. \nSTANLEY (to the Key-Guard) Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something! \nTHE GUARD tunrs up the volume on JEOPARDY, drowning Stanley out. \nEXT. DORIAN'S HOUSE - DAY \nA slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City. Sweet Eddy pulls Tina from the limo. \nINT. DORIAN'S HOUSE \nSweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room. Dorian rises to meet her. \nDORIAN (SARCASTICALLY) Baby, there you are... (he embraces her) I was gettin' all worried about you. \nTINA I just went out for a little while Dorian. \nSweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder bag he got from her car. \nDORIAN Looks like maybe a long little while, right baby? \nDorian grabs her by the throat and SLAMS her against the wall. The pictures rattle. \nDORIAN You know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me? Do you?! \nTINA (CHOKING) No... \nDORIAN Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will. \nHe tosses her onto the bed. She lies there gasping for breath. \nDORIAN Now fix yourself up, baby. And pick out something pretty to wear tonight. \nDorian picks up the mask and admires it. \nDORIAN (CONT.) We're going to make a big splash at that opening. One this town will never forget. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL CELL - DAY \nAgitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open. An IDEA! He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk. STANLEY peers down the hall and sees \nTHE KEY GUARD \nwatching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain strap. There's a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the desk. \nSTANLEY \nclimbs up on the cot and looks out the window. \nSTANLEY (stage whisper) Milo! \nEXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME \nJust a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then... a RUSTLE. A filthy blanket moves... and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he sees Stanley. \nThe little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window. \nSTANLEY Come on, boy! \nMilo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top of the dumpster. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Come on, Milo! \nMilo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but falls back down again into the trash heap. \nINT. KITCHEN \nThe Thug enters, brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way into the kitchen. \nC.U. - FOOT \nHe steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right out from under him. SLAM. \nTHUG'S P.O.V. \nas he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed. \nTHUG Whoaaaaa! \nSuddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG. \nSTANLEY \nplucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the casino. \nINT. CASINO \nStanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention of the nearest captive party-goers. \nSTANLEY Pssst. You guys. Over here. \nCharlie turns around. \nCHARLIE Stanley! What are you doing here? \nHe motions them over to the kitchen and hands Charlie the gun. \nSTANLEY Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil. \nStanley now makes his way deeper into the casino. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - POLICE CAR \nMilo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens. He scurries off towards the casino. \nINT. CASINO \nThe Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one OF the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes. \nSWEDE Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag! \nDorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and casually begins to juggle them. \nDORIAN/MASK Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to grind with you. In fact I got a couple and I'm afraid they may give you a splitting headache! \nHe nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax. \nDORIAN/MASK (CONT.) Round and round she goes. Who dies first, nobody knows! \nANGLE ON THE VIKING SHIP \nStanley pops up behind the dragon-prow and starts untying Tina. \nTINA Stanley! \nSTANLEY Hang on, Tina. \nTINA Stanley, look out! \nStanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right next to him in half. \nDorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat. \nStanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. \nDorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he extends his slimy tongue. \nC.U. - TONGUE \nThe bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle. \nDorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking shield and protects Tina and himself. \nDorian blows the bullets back at Stanley. \nRAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. \nThey batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the impact. \nA HUGE GREEN CLAW \ndrags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place. \nDORIAN/MASK How touching! The two love birds. Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I'm going to let you spend the rest of your lives together. \nTINA You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. Nobody! \nDORIAN/MASK If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is. \nSTANLEY \nburns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12 \nIN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES \nDorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of WATER now trickles down on him from above. \nDog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but... \nDOG/MASK \npounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight. \nVIKING SHIP \nStanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer stops. Tina exhales, relieved, as Stanley unties her. \nTINA (kissing him) You did it... \nC.U. - TIMER \nas it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0! \nA muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards. \nEXT. THE PIER - NIGHT \nThe two front support pilings BLOW UP. \nINT. CASINO - SAME TIME \nThe entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat. \nSTANLEY Milo! Milo, come! \nDog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the boat as... \nTHE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP! \nThe entire casino floor drops straight down. \nTHE SHIP SLIDES \nstraight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors. \nDORIAN \nSCREAMS as the boat slides right over him. \nEXT. HARBOR - NIGHT \nThe Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water. \nEXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT \nIt bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables. \nThey can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces. \nTINA Stanley... we made it. We're alive! \nMilo lets loose a happy \"Whoof!\" and leaps into Stanley's arms. Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back into a regular dog. \nDORIAN I'll take that. \nThey turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a gun pointed right at them. \nStanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye holes and holds it overboard. \nSTANLEY Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor. \nDorian stops in his tracks. \nDORIAN Drop it and I'll kill you all. \nSTANLEY You can have it. But she gets to go. \nDORIAN Fine. \nTINA Go where? \nSTANLEY Swimming. We're still close to shore. \nDORIAN Five seconds, Ipkiss. \nStanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina. \nSTANLEY Go ahead. Hurry... \nTina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in. \nDORIAN Okay. Put it down. Right over there. \n", "test1_input": "INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN \nStanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and JUMPS out of bed with a start. \nHe looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old Stanley. He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's. \nHe picks up the mask. Same old mask. \nSTANLEY A dream... It was only a dream. \nStanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAWN \nStanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas. \nLT. KELLAWAY Nice PJ's pal. \nSTANLEY Can I help you? \nLT. KELLAWAY You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss? \nSTANLEY That's right. \nLT. KELLAWAY Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman. \nSTANLEY (swallows hard) Really? I didn't hear a thing. \nLT. KELLAWAY Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from your door. \nKellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall tearfully speaking to anither OFFICER. \nStanley is flabbergasted to see: \nQUICK CUTS \nC.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls. \nC.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet. \nC.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock. \nAll flashbacks from last night! \nSTANLEY (GASPS) That's... impossible! \nLT. KELLAWAY Excuse me? \nStanley quickly pulls himself together. \nSTANLEY That's... a, possible. See, I have this inner ear problem. (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously) Sometimes I can't hear a thing. \nKELLAWAY (SKEPTICAL) Is that a fact? \nSTANLEY What? \nKellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself and shoots Stanley a dirty look. \nKELLAWAY Forget it. \nHe hands Stanley his card. \nKELLAWAY (CONT.) Here. You remember anything unusual about last night, anything at all, call me. \nSTANLEY Sure... thanks. \nStanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious dog-head-cocked-sideways look. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Milo, it was real! How could it all be... real? \nStanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) Oh my god. I'm late! \nHe races into the bedroom. \nINT. HALLWAY \nKellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs. Peenman. \nKELLAWAY Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow. \nMRS. PEENMAN Then you can choke on it for all I care. I saw what I saw. \nKELLAWAY Right. (refers to notes) A green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats. That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man. \nAn OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath. \nOFFICER Lt., we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street. \nKELLAWAY What? \nPOLICEMAN Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad. \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT \nStanley rushes around the apartment, but he can't find his keys anywhere. He finishes tying his tie as he searches. \nSTANLEY Milo! Keys! Keys! \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME \nMilo's ears prick. He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing around. He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys just as Stanley comes out, briefcaase in hand. \nSTANLEY Good boy. \nHe pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door... but he pauses to take a last look at the mask... It's eerie black eye holes and devilish grin seem to mock him. \nOn sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's sliding glass door and exits. \nSLOW-MO - THE MASK \nSailing end over end through the air. \nEXT. BUILDING \nAs the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up. \nThe mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands balanced precariously on a narrow ledge. Its mocking grin seems to glow with triumph. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - DAY \nThe place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti guerrillas: Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, etc. The \"Ripley Auto Finishing\" sign hangs askew over the doorway. Letters have been sprayed out to read \"Rip Off!\" \nSeveral REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and Irv out of the building on two gurneys. \nThey're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued to their foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four foot long mufflers sticking out of their rear ends. \nThey wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney. \nBURT AND IRV Ah!... Eeeh!... Ooh! \nParamedic #3 speaks into his emergency radio-phone as Burt and Irv are loaded into the van. \nPARAMEDIC #3 I want a proctologist standing by! Yeah, you heard me! The best one you can find. \nAn OFFICER steps out of the building and approaches Kellaway. \nOFFICER We were able to get a description Lt., but it's pretty weird. \nKELLAWAY (SIGHS) Let me guess... Big green head. Zoot suit. \nOFFICER How did you... \nKELLWAY Whoever this guy is, he's a world class twisto. \nPEGGY BRANDT, an attractive young woman in her mid twenties, appears besides the other reporters and approaches Kellaway, notepad in hand. \nPEGGY Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the Evening Star. Can you tell me what happened here? \nKELLAWAY Sorry. Too early to comment. \nPEGGY It looks like some kind of mob scare tactic. \nKELLAWAY I said no comment. Now break it up. This is a crime scene. \nAs the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy slips away from the group. Even though it's closed off with yellow police tape, Peggy slips inside the garage. \nINT. MECHANIC'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare. The same cartoon paint job covers the walls. Peggy looks around, SIFTING through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing. \nThen she spies the COMPLAINT BOX. Peggy opens it and pulls out a HANDFUL of pink \"comment\" slips. She looks at them. Almost all of them are from one customer - STANLEY IPKISS. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nStanley, still looking rumpled and unshaven, hurriedly takes off his coat and powers up his computer. Charlie steps over to his desk carrying a newspaper. \nCHARLIE What happened to you last night? The girls and I were looking all over for you. \nSTANLEY I uh, didn't feel so good. I decided to go home early. \nCHARLIE As a matter of fact, you don't look so good. You got to take better care of yourself, man. \nSTANLEY How was the club? \nCHARLIE Are you kidding?

You're early. \nTINA A little. \nSTANLEY I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay. \nTINA That's nice. (sits down) You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap. \nSTANLEY (looking at the sky) It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors. \nTINA Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens. \nSTANLEY Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way. (RISES) I guess I'll get going. \nTINA No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian. \nSTANLEY Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel? \nTINA Yeah. He's sort of my manager. \nSTANLEY Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal. \nTINA You really mean that, don't you? \nSTANLEY Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories... \nTINA No, I mean, you're really worried about me. That's... real sweet, Stanley. \nSTANLEY C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy? \nTINA I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have. \nSTANLEY Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed? \nTINA Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian. \nSTANLEY And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride. \nThat last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds. \nSTANLEY (CONT.) (SIGHS) I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better get going. \nStanley gets up and hurries off through the trees. \nTINA (RISES) Stanley... wait! \nBut he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the leaves all around her. \nThe Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust out he romances Tina in a deep syrupy French voice. \nTHE MASK Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je' taime, Je any old tame! At last we are together mon petite bon bon! \nANGLE ON THE BUSHES \nKellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a distance.

He pops one in her mouth. \nTHE MASK (CONT.) Cigarette? \nHis hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in her mouth. \nTHE MASK (CONT.) Regular? Menthol? Filter? Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo? \nHe produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on the flame. \nTHE MASK (CONT.) Let me get that for you! \nHe grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch.

I knew I'd forgotten something! (TEARS) I was so young! So foolish! So full of life! \nTears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps.

It really IS a picture of his wife with a handwritten note: \"Call me, lover - 555-1234!\" \nKELLAWAY What the --? (PAUSE) Margaret! \nFurious, Kellaway LUNGES at Stanley/Mask's neck. Two other officers restrain him. \nKELLAWAY You son of a bitch -- ! \nSTANLEY/MASK Jeez, I figured you had a sense of humor!

There's no way you're just going to walk out of here. \nSTANLEY (PAUSES) You're right. \nStanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the Guard's gun.

BEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. GABE laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. JED, 9, and ELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. JED looks up. 
JED Dad? 
JACOB Jed. It's the middle of the night. (he kisses GABE and goes over to JED in the lower bunk) What's up? 
JED You forgot my allowance. 
JACOB Your allowance? It's five A.M. We'll talk at breakfast. 
JED Okay, but don't forget. 
Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk. 
ELI I love you, Dad. 
JACOB smiles. 
JACOB What is this, a convention? I love you, too, Pickles. Now go back to sleep. 
He turns to leave. 
GABE Wait ... Daddy. 
JACOB Now what? 
GABE Don't go. 
JACOB Don't go? (he smiles) I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe. (he looks at his son tenderly) Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours. 
He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door. 
GABE ... I love you. 
There is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB is struck by them. 
GABE (continuing) Don't shut the door. 
JACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar. 
GABE (continuing) A bit more ... a bit more. 
JACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him secure. GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed. 
INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
JACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets comfortable. JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He pulls the blankets up to his neck. He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing. 
JACOB I love you, Sarah. 
She smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back asleep. 
EXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN 
WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise, can be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting. 
Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's voices. 
VOICE They're here. 
VOICE Thank God. Move 'em out! 
VOICES Bust your balls! 
VOICE Move it! Move it! 
There is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a huge CLEARING. 
High overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS leap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with turbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices yell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency. 
The CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come into view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. Hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it. 
Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds, warm and familiar. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
JACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub. Surprisingly JEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there too. JACOB stares at them in total confusion. 
DOCTOR You are a lucky man, my friend. A lucky man. You must have friends in high places, that's all I can say. 
SAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending their hands to the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue, reach out to them. 
Slowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one step onto the tile and collapses to the floor. 
CUT TO BLACK: 
INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY

PROLOGUE 
BLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer. 
FRANCES (V.O.) No one ever came up to me and said, 'You're a fool. There isn't such a thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing you.' 
FADE IN: 
EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY 
On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A girl's face breaks through. 
FRANCES (V.O.) It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right. 
The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach. 
FRANCES (V.O.) And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me. 
EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER 
The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun. 
FRANCES (V.O.) But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.' 
INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING 
Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door. 
FRANCES It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it. 
ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read. 
FRANCES But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always? 
Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly. 
ERNEST Bye, baby. 
FRANCES See you next weekend, Dad. 
He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves. 
FRANCES I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Frances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner hangs: "NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931." 
FRANCES I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness. 
The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried. 
FRANCES I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me. 
Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands. 
WOMAN You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer! 
A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman continues to glare at Frances. 
Frances stares back, dumbfounded. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY 
The screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now!", "Workers of the World Unite!", and "Elect Kaminski!" stands MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK. 
KAMINSKI And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family? 
YORK & CROWD No! 
KAMINSKI Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children? 
YORK & CROWD No! 
KAMINSKI Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country? 
YORK & CROWD No! No! 
KAMINSKI Good! Because, Brothers, that's you! 
The crowd cheers. Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up sign as a banner unfurls: "Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the World."

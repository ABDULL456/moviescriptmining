ETHAN (frowning at Debbie) Lucy, you ain't much bigger than when I saw you last. 
DEBBIE I'm Deborah! (pointing) She's Lucy. 
Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger. 
EXT. YARD - ANOTHER ANGLE 
as Lucy steps down from the porch and approaches. 
MARTHA Lucy's going on seventeen now... 
BEN An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too! 
MARTHA That's enough... Go on inside and help Lucy set the table... You, too, Deborah! 
EXT. YARD - FULL SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE 
as Martin -- with slightly averted face -- crosses to take the bridle of Ethan's horse and lead him away. 
ETHAN (wheeling on him) MOMENTO! 
Martin checks his stride, stares in surprise. 
MARTHA (contritely) Martin!... Here we've been standing... Ethan, you haven't forgotten Martin? 
ETHAN Oh... Mistook you for a half-breed. 
MARTIN (levelly) Not quite... Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh... So they tell me. 
ETHAN You've done a lot of growin'... 
AARON It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred... 
ETHAN (bluntly) It just happened to be me... No need to make any more of it... 
MARTIN I'll take care of your horse for you, Uncle Ethan. 
Again, he starts to lead away. 
ETHAN Hold on! 
Martin stops again. 
ETHAN I'll take this... 
He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it as though it contained something of value. Martin watches with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him. 
Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn't care what Martin thinks, nor does he explain. Martin leads the horse off. 
MARTHA Supper'll be ready by the time you wash up... Let me take your coat for you, Ethan. 
He hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it -- conscious of its sorry condition. 
MARTHA (smiling faintly) And... welcome home. 
He just nods, then turns to follow Aaron around the side of the house toward the wash-up. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA 
She stands alone, looking after Ethan -- his coat in her arms. She holds it against her breast for just a moment and her eyes are tender. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT 
The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite, but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace -- in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre Ethan has brought home from the wars. 
He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard. 
Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father's right and Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is watching Ethan. 
Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly. 
ETHAN Good. 
The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm gong. Eight fast clangs. 
AARON Ben! Deborah! Bed! 
DEBBIE But I've got to help with the dishes. 
MARTHA Not tonight... Ben, put that sword back. 
BEN It's not a sword, ma... it's a saber! (moving to Ethan) Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan? 
ETHAN (matter-of-factly) Some... 
BEN How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan? 
MARTHA Ben!... Martin, he'll sleep in the bunkhouse with you tonight. 
Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night. 
MARTIN Good night, Aunt Martha... Uncle Aaron... (he hesitates) Good night, Uncle Ethan. 
Ethan doesn't like being called Uncle -- as we must know from the quick look he shoots at Martin. But he acknowledges it. 
ETHAN Night. 
Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.

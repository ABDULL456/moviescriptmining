EMIL Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out? 
Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes it. 
EMIL (CONT'D) That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me. 
CUTLER Your father put cigarettes out on you? 
EMIL Out on my back when I was a small boy. 
CUTLER Can I see your back? 
Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified. 
CUTLER (CONT'D) Oh, Jesus. 
EMIL I'm abused.  Don't you think? 
CUTLER I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. 
INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a subpoena in his hand. 
DUFFY The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King! 
JORDY What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. 
DUFFY Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! 
JORDY Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. 
DUFFY Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. 
JORDY End my career? 
DUFFY How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield. 
JORDY But Chief?  Over this?? 
DUFFY There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial. 
Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun - looks at it. 
DUFFY (CONT'D) (pats Jordy's shoulder) I know you got backup at home.  Drop it off. 
Jordy sighs and exits. 
INT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY 
Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS. 
STERN (to Jordy) Look, what don't you understand?  We've got a good relationship with the Czech's and the State Department doesn't want to cause an incident. 
JORDY But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness! 
STERN They've got her testimony on videotape. And even if they do take her to court immediately after she'll be extradited. The Czechs want her back.  She shot a cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic?  How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?! 
Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers his voice. 
STERN (CONT'D) And just between us...I was married to a redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from both. 
Jordy gives him a look. 
STERN (CONT'D) You want to see her - go ahead. 
Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The assistant U.S. Attorneys leave. 
JORDY We're gonna fight the extradition. 
Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers. 
DAPHNE Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own. 
JORDY ...Do you really want me to forget about you? 
DAPHNE I don't want to drag you down with me. 
JORDY Daphne, I...

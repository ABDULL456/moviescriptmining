JEANNE Peanuts? 
Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES for the MALE GENITALIA. 
PAUL Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint! 
Jeanne gets a kick out of this... Sort of. 
JEANNE It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here. 
PAUL Did you have fun as a kid? 
JEANNE It's the most beautiful thing. 
PAUL It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy. 
JEANNE I wasn't like that. 
PAUL No? 
JEANNE I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. A lot of tower. 
PAUL Did you ever think about sex? 
JEANNE No. No sex. 
Paul MOCKS HER. 
PAUL "No. No sex." 
JEANNE Tower. 
He gives her a LOVE SMACK on the head. 
PAUL You were probably in love with your teacher. 
JEANNE My teacher was a woman. 
PAUL And she was a lesbian. 
JEANNE How did you know? 
PAUL That's classical... Anyway... 
JEANNE My first love was my cousin Paul. 
Paul explodes.

JEANNE Sorry. Sorry. 
PAUL Well, go on. Tell the truth. What else? 
JEANNE I was ... He was dark, very thin. I can see him. Big nose! A big romance. I fell in love with him when I heard him playing piano. 
PAUL You mean when he first got into your knickers. 
JEANNE He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands. 
PAUL I'll bet he was... Probably getting his kicks. 
JEANNE We were dying of heat. 
PAUL Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else? 
JEANNE In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping... 
PAUL You started grabbing his joint. 
JEANNE You're crazy! 
PAUL Well, he touched you. 
JEANNE I never let him! Never! 
PAUL Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire. 
JEANNE No, I'm not.

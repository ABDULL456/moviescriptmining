Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break. 
NICKY Ow...what was that for? 
BUM Fifty million dollars. 
The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!" And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked. 
Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running right at him.  He closes his eyes. 
NICKY Release the evil. 
Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD. 
The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked out.

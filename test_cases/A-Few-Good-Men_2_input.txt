RANDOLPH enters. 
SERGEANT AT ARMS All rise. 
ROSS Too late. 
KAFFEE walks back to his table as 
SERGEANT AT ARMS All those having business with this general court-martial, stand forward and you shall be heard. Captain Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding. God save the United States of America. 
RANDOLPH raps the gavel. 
RANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the court record. 
ROSS No objection, your honor. 
KAFFEE No objection. 
RANDOLPH Is the Government prepared to make an opening statement? 
ROSS (standing) Yes sir. 
ROSS walks to the jury box. 
ROSS (continuing) The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill. (beat) Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case. (beat) And they are undisputed. 
ROSS walks back to his seat. 
RANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee? 
Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of his mouth. 
KAFFEE There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true. (beat) When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do. (beat) Let me say that again: It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags. (beat) Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job. 
KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat. 
RANDOLPH Is the Government ready to call its first witness? 
ROSS Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C McGuire. 
While McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn in, KAFFEE has sat back down. 
He leans over to DAWSON and whispers. 
KAFFEE How you doin'? 
DAWSON doesn't change his expression. 
KAFFEE (continuing) Good. 
ROSS Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please? 
MCGUIRE Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service. 
ROSS Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year? 
MCGUIRE We did. 
ROSS What did the letter say? 
MCGUIRE That a member of Private Santiago's unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline. 
ROSS Was that marine identified in the letter? 
MCGUIRE No sir. I notified the barracks C.O., Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming down to investigate. 
ROSS And what did you find? 
MCGUIRE For the shift reported, only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing. 
ROSS And who was that? 
MCGUIRE Lance Corporal Harold Dawson. 
ROSS (continuing; to KAFFEE) Your witness. 
ROSS goes back to his table. KAFFEE stands. 
KAFFEE Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting? 
MCGUIRE Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy. 
KAFFEE But you don't believe him. 
MCGUIRE It's not my place -- 
KAFFEE Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause? 
MCGUIRE There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. 
KAFFEE Thank you. 
KAFFEE sits. 
ROSS Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. You had Willy Santiago's letter. 
MCGUIRE Santiago was the only witness, but I never had a chance to interview him. So I don't know what he saw. 
ROSS And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr. McGuire? 
MCGUIRE No. 
ROSS No more questions.

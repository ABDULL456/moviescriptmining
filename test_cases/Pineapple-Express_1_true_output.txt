Dale and Saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the elevator. 
INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
The rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray. 
MATHESON Look. 
Budlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial. 
BUDLOFSKY Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I think he knew we were coming. 
INT. DALE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Dale peels out of his spot and down the road. 
DALE Okay, what do you know about Ted? 
SAUL What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew. 
Saul checks behind them. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Let's go to your place. 
DALE No way! What if they did see my license plate!?! 
SAUL Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn. 
DALE Well, how much money do we have? 
SAUL All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me. 
DALE That's it!?! 
SAUL Well, how much money do you have? 
While Dale gets out his wallet, Saul opens Dale's change tray. It's full of roaches. 
DALE Uh...nine bucks. 
SAUL Well, shut up then! I've got more than you! 
DALE Fine. Forget the hotel. 
A tense beat. 
SAUL I wish we could just go nowhere. 
DALE Okay...where's nowhere? 
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS 
The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over. 
DALE So what do we know? Nothing. We may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. And, we could just be completely crazy. But, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were? 
SAUL (thrilled) He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but I mean- 
DALE No, what I mean is, if Ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you? 
SAUL There's no way. He could only find out from Red. 
DALE Who is this Red guy? 
SAUL Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her. 
DALE But let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he? 
SAUL Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand job by now! 
DALE Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer. 
SAUL So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you don't trust me then? 
Saul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond. 
DALE Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him. 
SAUL Thank you!

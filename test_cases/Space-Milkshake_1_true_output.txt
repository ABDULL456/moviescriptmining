INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT A bunch of cables run from an open panel below the computer screen. Jimmy (wearing his old clothing) shoves all the computer parts into the wall and closes the panel. WENDI (O.S.) Beep. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   34A. 
JIMMY Wendi, can you identify me? WENDI (O.S.) You are Station Engineering Specialist Jimmy Anderson. You are a Libra. Your favorite color is blue. Your favorite food is chocolate cake. JIMMY How are you doing? Jimmy types, flips switches, leafs through binders and tests circuits under the following scene. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   35. 
WENDI (O.S.) All systems are nominal, however I have not received a mission protocol update from Western Alliance Ground Control. How are you feeling? JIMMY It looks like your social interface program is back online. WENDI (O.S.) Yes Jimmy, it is. I am pleased that you noticed. JIMMY Why do you have a man's voice? WENDI (O.S.) I am operating on default human interface settings. JIMMY Anton hates it. WENDI (O.S.) Would you like to select a different interface protocol? JIMMY No stay like this. Can you show me the station video monitors? A grid of grainy black and white video cameras comes up. One screen shows Valentina walking down the hall angrily with her bath robe, towel and 2 rubber duckies. Another monitor shows a medium shot of Tilda kneeling in engineering area next to a wall panel marked T518. She looks around nervously and opens it. WENDI (O.S.) Jimmy, I appear to have an open access port in my T518 array. Jimmy zooms in, it's grainy. Tilda pulls out a row of circuits labeled "T518 D7", removes a small circuit board and looks at it. She closes the panel. Jimmy watches Tilda on the monitor screen: she sits back and unzips her flight suit. He leans in towards the monitor. JIMMY Why are women so complicated? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   36. 
WENDI (O.S.) If you wish to improve a social relationship I recommend engaging in friendly conversation. JIMMY What's your T518 array used for? WENDI T518 is a language processor for human interface systems. On the monitor we can see Tilda take the circuit board and jam it into her torso on her right side. The screen garbles slightly with electrical interference. Jimmy zooms in but it's hard to see what's going on. Tilda rubs her side, there's no mark and the circuit board is gone. She zips up her jumpsuit and tries to talk with fax sounds. TILDA ZZZBBOOOORRRRRPXKXS! Jimmy watches the monitor with distracted fascination. JIMMY Have you ever been in love, Wendi? WENDI (O.S.) I love being the orbital sanitation station mainframe computer. ANTON (O.S.) You didn't fix the voice. Jimmy quickly switches off the video monitor screen and turns around. Anton comes in. JIMMY It's stuck this way. ANTON What's the male version of Wendi? Winston? Walter? Walter. WENDI (O.S.) Wendi is used for both sexes. JIMMY I knew a guy named Wendi. I called him Wendi once. Maybe by mistake. I think his name was Wendal. ANTON We're calling you Walter from now on. Okay Walter? Walter. Respond. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   36A. 
No response for a second. WENDI (O.S.) My name is Wendi. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   37. 
ANTON See if you can fix the coffee machine next. JIMMY What's wrong with the coffee machine? ANTON How should I know? JIMMY I'm not sure this power converter is going to hold and we're out of spares. Wendi could go down again. ANTON Go look in the salvage bay, there's probably something you can use. JIMMY Ok. ANTON Now. JIMMY Oh, ok. Jimmy gets up and goes.

MARTIN That's the evidence of a guy named Dahlerus. He's a Swede. Friend of Hermann Goering. I want you to study it. And I want you to use it. 
David tries to sneeze but fails; he starts to read. 
MARTIN We're going to find more stuff to feed you. We'll have some other suggestions. We need to build a case for the defence - based not on feelings, not on prejudice, but on facts. 
He watches David read. David is engrossed. Almost imperceptibly, he shakes his head. 
EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY 
A half-ruined café with tables on the sidewalk. WERNER, the timpanist, SCHLEE, the oboist, and two others seated at one of the tables, drinking coffee. 
David carries an attaché case and walks towards the café. He scans the people at the tables, sees the musicians and approaches. They stand. 
WERNER Lieutenant Wills. 
David nods 
WERNER Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer, cello and Herr Schmidt, viola. They are willing to help. We have already ordered ourselves coffee. I hope you... 
DAVID Yeah, of course. 
WERNER The whole orchestra will vouch for him. He was always there to support us. 
DAVID We need names, if possible with addresses, because it's urgent. Names of musicians saved by Dr. Furtwängler, people he helped to escape abroad. Let's go somewhere public. 
David leaves money on the table and then walks off with the four men. They talk as they make their way down a side street. 
INT. DYMSHITZ'S VILLA - NIGHT 
Steve and Dymshitz sit opposite each other and clink vodka glasses.  They have been drinking but are not yet drunk. 
DYMSHITZ To co-operation. 
They drink. Dymshitz pours more vodka. 
STEVE I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit. 
DYMSHITZ Furtwängler's in a different category. 
STEVE We're dealing with degenerates here. 
He is still for a moment, then grabs the bottle and pours himself a drink, downs it. Dymshitz watches him, then: 
DYMSHITZ Degenerates?

Miles of unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie. \nBEVERLY (OS) ...\"Life is very long...\" \n2   MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD                                      2 \nTwo lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon. \nBEVERLY (OS) TS Eliot. Not the first person to say it, certainly not the first person to think it. \n3   A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK                                3 \nFlat, still. An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly, tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock. \nBEVERLY (OS) But he's given credit for it because he bothered to write it down. \n4   AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL                   4 \nAt the end of a long gravel road.   Surrounded by towering black walnuts and lace-bark elms.   A farm once, no one's put a plow to earth here in decades. \nBEVERLY (OS) So if you say it, you have to say his name after it. \"Life is very long:\" TS Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right. \nWrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows. \nBEVERLY (OS) (CONT'D) Give the devil his due. Very few poets could've made it through Eliot's trial and come out, brilliantined and double-breasted and Anglican. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   2. 4   CONTINUED:                                                    4 \nAnd now, a face fills the screen -- \n5   INT. BEVERLY'S DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT                     5 \nBEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.    We take a long moment, just to study that face. \nBEVERLY Not hard to imagine, faced with Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how Crane or Berryman might have reacted, just foot-raced to the nearest bridge; Olympian Suicidalists. \nStares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) Not Eliot: after sufficient years of ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the nearest asylum and get on with it. \nHe sits   at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses a glass   of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his careful   selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to someone   we do not yet see. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) God-a-mighty. You have to admire the purity of the survivor's instinct. \nFrom somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) Violet. My wife. She takes pills, sometimes a great many. They affect... among other things, her equilibrium. Fortunately, they eliminate her need for equilibrium... \n6   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT                              6 \nFull of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets. We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons, lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    3. \n7   INT.

Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into -- \nBEVERLY The reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential. \nThe hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) The facts are: my wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck, just one paragraph of our marriage contract... cruel covenant. And these facts have over time made burdensome the maintenance of traditional American routine. \nShe makes her way to the stairs starts down. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) Rather than once more vow abstinence with my fingers crossed in the queasy hope of righting our ship, I've chosen to turn my life over to a Higher Power and join the ranks of the Hiring Class. \nThe light from the study slices across the living room. \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) It's not a decision with which I'm entirely comfortable. I know how to launder my dirty undies. Done it all my life, but I'm finding it's getting in the way of my drinking. \nShe can see a portion of Beverly's desk, a woman's legs. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   4. 8   CONTINUED:                                                     8 \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) Sorry about the heat in here. My wife is cold-blooded and not just in the metaphorical sense. She does not believe in air-conditioning... as if it is a thing to be disbelieved. I knew your father, you know. Bought many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he?? \nJOHNNA Yes, sir. \nBEVERLY May I ask how? \nJOHNNA He had a heart attack. Fell into a flatbed truck full of wine grapes. \nHe takes a book from the bookshelf, gives it to her. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   8. 8    CONTINUED:                                                      8 \nBEVERLY (CONT'D) TS Eliot.

The surface undulating gently as we GLIDE through a lake's dark, tenebrous waters on a moonlit night. \nA rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision. It's aluminum hull cutting through the calm above, sending out small waves as it makes it's way SLOWLY past. \nOars dip in on either side, propelling the small craft toward deeper water. It slows.

She sits up. CLOSE ON: BARBARA FORDHAM, late- forties, fully dressed. She gropes for the phone. \nBARBARA ...Ivy? ...what's wrong? \nBarb stands, moves slowly to the window. Outside: identical suburban homes, neutral house colors, lawns. \nWe STUDY Barb as she listens. Greying roots, no make-up, a few extra pounds. A woman who, for reasons we don't yet understand, has decided to stop giving a damn. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) ...When...? \nJean passes in the hall.

(no answer) Mom? \nSteps into the open door of her father's study. His vacant desk chair, untouched papers, dust mots settling in the sunlight. She takes a moment, then heads upstairs. CARRYING US with her. Finds Violet, in her bedroom, sitting in front of her vanity in near darkness, smoking and on the phone. \nVIOLET ...You've been out there...? \nBarely acknowledges Ivy's arrival. The room is unruly. Bed unmade. Clothes draped over chairs.

More pills, wet towels on the floor. She turns off the dripping faucet. Picks up towels. \nVIOLET (CONT'D) Stop that... \nViolet is off the phone, standing in hall, watching Ivy. Ivy stops, briefly chastened. Violet opens a bottle of pills. \nVIOLET (CONT'D) You call Barb? What'd she say? \nIVY She's on her way. \nVIOLET What'd you tell her? \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Goddamn, it's hot. \nBill unlocks the trunk, begins unloading luggage. \nBILL Suppose your mom's turned on the air conditioner? \nBARBARA You kidding? Remember the parakeets? \nBILL The parakeets? \nBARBARA I didn't tell you about the parakeets? She got a parakeet for some insane reason, and the little fucker croaked after two days.

With Beverly missing, and your mother crazy as a loon? You want to do this now? \nBARBARA You're right. I'll just hunker down for a cozy night's sleep upstairs. Next to my husband. \nBILL This discussion deserves our   care. And patience. We'll both be    in a better frame of mind to talk   about this once your father's come   home. \nBill turns, starts back for the house. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft      43. \n30      INT. WESTON HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT                             30 \nJean sees her father coming, hears his footsteps approaching across the wooden porch below, the screen door opens quietly.

SKIATOOK LAKE - NIGHT                                    31 \nWe're on the old wooden dock, watching a man walking away from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the dock in the moonlight. He leans down to untie the boat, looks back at us, directly into camera -- Beverly. \nNow we're traveling BELOW the surface of the lake, through its dark, tenebrous waters on the moonlit night. The rhythmic SLAP of gentle waves. We're underwater, light fractures and scatters above us. We've been here before as -- \nA rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision.   It's aluminum bottom cuts through the calm above. \nOars dip on either side, propelling the small craft. It slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch -- \nUntil, suddenly, something hits the surface above, exploding the calm, coming at us fast, sinking. \n32      INT.

SKIATOOK LAKE ROAD - DAWN                               41 \nThe sun's just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows across the flat expanse of prairie. Scattered trees, a ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake, telephone poles. \nWe're HIGH ABOVE the country road, following the Sheriff cruiser below. Barb's rental sedan trails behind. \nBARBARA (OS) I used to go out with that boy. That man. \n42   INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - EARLY MORNING                     42 \nBill drives, Ivy up front with him. Barbara sits in the back with Jean. Watches the sheriff's car ahead. \nJEAN What man? The Sheriff? \nBARBARA In high school. He was my prom date. \nJEAN You're kidding. \nBARBARA Day of the prom, his father got drunk and stole his car, stole his own son's car, went somewhere, Mexico. Deon showed up at the door. He'd been crying. Confessed he didn't have a way to take me to the prom. \"August\" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   48. 42   CONTINUED:                                                   42 \nThe cruiser slows, pulls through a pipe gate and over a cattle-crossing, heads for a small collection of emergency vehicles parked around a brush-strewn cove. Bev's old Chevy pick-up truck sits to one side. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) So we got a six-pack and broke into the chapel, stayed up all night talking and kissing. Now here he is, showing me -- (fights her emotions) It's so surreal. Thank God we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed. \nThe cars stop.    The Sheriff gets out. \nBILL Let me go first, see what they need. \nBill goes.    Barb fixes Jean with a look. \nBARBARA Listen to me: die after me, all right? I don't care what else you do, where you go, how you screw up your life, just... survive. Outlive me, please. \nThey watch the men. A resolute Bill returns to get Barbara and Ivy. The sisters climb out, follow him to the water's edge.

They ride in silence. We study their faces, the brown countryside outside. \nBill notices something in his rearview, a red speck, coming up fast, very fast. A sports car. \nIt's suddenly right behind them, filling his mirrors. It waits for a semi loaded down with massive circular hay bales to pass in the opposite lane, then -- \nROARS around. A Ferrari, it's throaty V-10 RUMBLING as it SCREAMS past, accelerates down the road. Bill and Jean exchange a look, watch it disappear. \n47   INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY                                     47 \nStrong male hands lift Beverly's now dressed body carefully and place it into the casket. Adjust the pillow, comb his hair into place, fold his hands across his chest. \nWe never see his face, never see his whole body. Only these small, intimate pieces. \n48   INT/EXT. CAR/FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF PAWHUSKA - DAY             48 \nA few mourners enter the church as Bill pulls in to park, discovers the Ferrari already there.

Recoils slightly. Mattie Fae catches her, whispers comforts into her ear, helps her toward the church steps. \nWe stay back, watching the Westons enter the church -- \nKAREN (VO) I spent so    much time in our bedroom pretending    my pillow was my husband and did he    like the dinner I made and where were    we going to vacation that winter and    he'd surprise me with tickets to    Belize and we'd kiss. \n49   INT. BEVERLY'S LINCOLN (MOVING) - AFTERNOON                     49 \nBarbara drives, Karen beside her. Heat radiates off the road. They follow Charlie's Caddie, Vi and Ivy visible in the Caddie's back seat window ahead of us. \nKAREN I mean I'd kiss my pillow, and then I'd tell him I'd been to the doctor that day and I'd found out I was pregnant. I know how pathetic that sounds, but it was innocent enough. Then real life takes over, cause it always does -- \n52   INT.

Did you get a feel? \nBARBARA He seemed very nice, sweetheart -- \nBarb grabs a glass from the cabinet, opens the freezer for ice, lets her head linger in the cold. \nKAREN He is, and -- \nBARBARA -- but what I think doesn't matter. I'm not marrying him -- \nKAREN I guess what I'm telling you is that I'm happy. I've been unhappy most of my life,   my adult life. I doubt you've been aware of that. I know our lives have led us apart, you, me and Ivy. Maybe we're not as close as, as close as some families -- \nBarb gives up on the freezer, fills her glass with iced tea. \nBARBARA Yeah, we really need to talk about Mom, what to do about Mom -- \nKAREN -- but I think I haven't wanted to live my unhappiness in view of my family. But now I'm just really happy. I'd like us to get to know each other a little better. \nBarbara stares at her, what is she talking about? \nBARBARA Yes.

Throughout the following they watch Bill shop for wine inside. \nSTEVE Is it always this hot? \nJEAN Usually it's hotter. \nSTEVE Hard to imagine.

Hey, look at me. (Jean does) And you were so distraught over the start time of your Grandpa's funeral. Was this your concern? Getting back here in time to watch Phantom of the Fucking Opera? \nJEAN I guess. \nBarb gives Jean a withering look, exits. Bill takes the wine from Steve, follows.

He stares pensively out at the passing Pawhuska storefronts as the bus SLOWS, pulls into a parking lot next to the bank. \nHe spots Charlie, waiting, drinking a Coke. Little Charles exhales, stands. Steps reluctantly out into the heat. \nLITTLE CHARLES I'm sorry, Dad. \nCHARLIE No need to apologize. \nLITTLE CHARLES I know Mom's mad at me. \nCHARLIE Don't worry about her. \nLITTLE CHARLES What did she say? \nCHARLIE Your mother, she says what she says. \nLITTLE CHARLES I set the alarm.

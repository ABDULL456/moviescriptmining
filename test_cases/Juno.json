{"train": "JUNO \nWritten by \nDiablo Cody \nEXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK \nJUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger. \nJUNO (V.O.) It started with a chair. \nINT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT \nFLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. \nA 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player. \nWHISPERED VOICE Do you know how long I've wanted this? \nJUNO Yeah. \nWHISPERED VOICE Wizard. \nEXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED \nA DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality. \nJUNO Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob for a second, okay? \nWe see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again. \nJUNO (V.O.) This is the most magnificent discarded living room set I've ever seen. \nShe swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. \nBEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE: \nJuno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly on a mission. \nEXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY \nFinally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk. \nThe automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS with skateboards near the entrance glare at her. \nShe enters the DRUGSTORE. \nINT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS \nROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest. \nROLLO Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test? \nJUNO I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign. \nRollo regards her with intense skepticism. \nJUNO I remain unconvinced. \nRollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach. \nROLLO This is your third test today, Mama Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt about it! \nAn eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. \nTOUGH GIRL Three times? Oh girl, you are way pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your nipples real brown? \nLEAH How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests? \nJUNO I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier. \nLEAH Is this for real? Like for real, for real? \nJUNO Unfortunately, yes. \nLEAH Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! \nJUNO That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. \nLEAH Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke. \nJUNO I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now. \nLEAH Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year. \nJUNO Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent. \nEXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT \nLeah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team. \nLEAH Heavy lifting can only help you at this point. \nJUNO That is sick, man. \nLeah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate portrayal of Bleeker's parents. \nLEAH So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be? \nJUNO Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant. \nLEAH When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker? \nJUNO Like, a year ago, in Spanish class. \nINT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK) \nBleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. \nEXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT \nLEAH Aha! You love him. \nJUNO It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state. \nShe hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing her father's LIFTING BELT. \nLEAH So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod? \nJUNO It was magnificent, man! \nINT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nCU of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed. \nCU of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands. \nCU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide. \nINT. KITCHEN - BLEEKER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nCU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave. \nEXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING \nJuno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop in his heyday. \nShe grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway. \nSTEVE RENDAZO Hey, your book fell apart! \nJUNO Yeah. \nSTEVE RENDAZO It must have looked at your face. PWAH! \nHe high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along. \nJUNO (V.O.) The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo secretly wants me. Jocks like him always want freaky girls. Girls with horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and Goth makeup. Girls who play the cello and wear Converse All-Stars and want to be children's librarians when they grow up. Oh yeah, jocks eat that shit up. \nWe see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings. \nJUNO (V.O.) They just won't admit it, because they're supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders like Leah. Who, incidentally, is into teachers. \nWe see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH. \nLEAH (from a distance) Me too! I love Woody Allen! \nINT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SCIENCE LAB - DAY \nSTUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her bag. \nMR. TINKER People! We're doing our photomagnetism lab today, so find your partner and break out into fours. \nJuno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness! \nJuno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab station and unpack their bags in silence. \nJUNO Well! Nothing like experimenting. \nBLEEKER I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to. \nHe slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without looking at her. \nJUNO Oh, I couldn't copy your work. \nBLEEKER But you copy my work every week. \nJUNO Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh? \nBLEEKER I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table. \nJUNO Charisma? \nBLEEKER Or something. \nThe other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at the station. \nJUNO So, who's ready for some photomagnificence? \nGIRL LAB PARTNER I have a menstrual migraine, and I can't look at bright lights today. \nGUY LAB PARTNER Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen. \nGIRL LAB PARTNER No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man. \nGUY LAB PARTNER You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened! \nGIRL LAB PARTNER Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes. \nGUY LAB PARTNER What? My eyes are not lying! \nGIRL LAB PARTNER Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes. \nBREN is cutting up LIBERTY'S food diligently. Her nails are brilliant, holding the silverware. \nJUNO (V.O.) That's my stepmom, Bren... \nINT. BREN'S WORKROOM - DAY \nBren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog. \nJUNO (V.O.) She's obsessed with dogs... \nEXT. BREN'S TENS - DAY \nBren's nail salon in all its glory. \nJUNO (V.O.) ...owns a nail salon called Bren's Tens... \nINT. BREN'S TENS - DAY \nBren chats up a customer as she applies a fresh coat. \nJUNO (V.O.) ...and she always smells like methylmethacrylate. \nINT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLiberty Bell coughs pitifully as Bren leans over her plate. \nMAC So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night? \nJUNO Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes? \nBren speaks in her strong city accent. \nBREN Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning. \nJUNO I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it. \nWe see Liberty Bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her dinner. \nMAC Liberty Bell, if I see one more Baco on that potato, I'm gonna kick your monkey ass. \nEXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY \nJuno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent holding a hugely oversized sign that reads \"NO BABIES LIKE MURDERING.\" \nLONE PROTESTER (chanting in extremely shy, accented voice) All babies want to get borned! All babies want to get borned! \nJuno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers. \nJUNO Uh, hi Su-Chin. \nSU-CHIN Oh, hi Juno. How are you? \nJUNO Good. I'm good. (pause) Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet? \nSU-CHIN No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating. \nJUNO You should try Adderall. \nSU-CHIN No thanks. I'm off pills. \nJUNO Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, \"Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!\" \nSU-CHIN I heard that was you. \nJUNO Well, it was nice seeing you. \nShe continues on toward the clinic entrance. \nJUNO I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless. \nLEAH Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break. \nJUNO Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break. \nLeah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend. \nLEAH Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver. \nJUNO There are ads? For parents? \nLEAH Oh yeah! \"Desperately Seeking Spawn.\" They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit. \nJUNO Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch. \nEXT. PARK BENCH - DAY \nJuno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers. \nJuno has her pipe with her. \nJUNO The Penny Saver sucks. \nLEAH Yeah, but it sucks for free. \nThey turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and teeth are Windex-blue. \nLEAH Look at this one \"Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other.\" (checks to see that Juno is paying attention) \"All that's missing is your bastard.\" \nJUNO (reading a different page) There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard. \nLEAH You're not listening to me. \nJUNO No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as \"wholesome.\" I'm looking for something a little edgier. \nLEAH What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest? \nJUNO I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular. \nLEAH All right, how about this one? \"Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love.\" \nJUNO Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids! \nLEAH Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one. \nShe points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno scans the ad silently. \nWe see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads \"Educated, successful couple wishes to...\" \nJUNO (V.O.) They were Mark and Vanessa Loring, and they were beautiful even in black and white. \nEXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S WINDOW - NIGHT \nWe see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish curtains -- and the light on inside. \nINT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way. \nHe stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep yearbook. \nWe see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message: \nJUNO (V.O.) Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with motion lotion. Just kidding (kind of.) Your best friend, Juno. \nBleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down. \nMAC Who is the kid? \nJUNO The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly. \nBREN Nails? Really? \nMAC No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno? \nJUNO Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker. \nBren and Mac burst into shocked laughter. \nJUNO What? \nMAC Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him! \nBREN (giggling) He just doesn't look, well, virile. \nLEAH I know, right? \nMAC Okay, this is no laughing matter. \nJUNO (indignant) No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair. \nLeah fires a be quiet glance at Juno. \nMAC Did you say you were thinking about adoption? \nJUNO Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years. \nLEAH We found them in the Penny Saver by the exotic birds section. \nBren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate. \nJUNO But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend. \nBREN Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now. \nJUNO Well, I'm not ready to be a mom. \nMAC Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds. \nJUNO Once! And she didn't die, if you recall! \nBREN Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative? \nLeah and Juno exchange glances. \nJUNO No. \nBREN Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking! \nJUNO Cool it. \nBREN First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver. \nJUNO The term \"deliver\" is so weird. Can we not say \"deliver\"? \nLEAH How does \"crap it out\" sound? \nMAC Juno, I want to come with you to meet these adoption people. You're just a kid. I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts. \nJUNO Sure, Dad. \nMac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally. \nMAC I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when. \nJuno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark. \nJUNO Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here. \nMARK Sorry. I was just getting something. \nJUNO Did your wife send you up here to spy on me? \nMARK What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something? \nJUNO Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know. \nMARK I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out. \nJUNO I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy. \nShe holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils. \nJUNO Smell those sparkling topnotes! \nMark inhales. \nMARK Am I supposed to feel happy now? \nJUNO You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in... \nMARK Viscera? \nJUNO Blood and guts. \nMARK We'd better get back downstairs ASAP. \nJuno mocks his use of \"ASAP\" silently. \nJUNO (halting) Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul? \nJuno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters. \nMARK Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff. \nJUNO Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark. \nMARK Shut up. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S \"SPECIAL\" ROOM - DAY \nThe walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc.) Mark removes his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno. \nJUNO It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender. \nMARK What do you play? \nJUNO I rock a Harmony. \nMARK (holding back a chuckle) Oh. \nJUNO What? I'm a pawn shop rocker. \nMARK Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob. \nJuno turns the guitar over, examining it closely. \nJUNO What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck? \nMARK Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are? \nJUNO (lying) Yeah. \nULTRASOUND TECH Oh. Well, thank goodness for that. \nBREN Wait, what's that supposed to mean? \nULTRASOUND TECH I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in. \nJuno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive. \nJUNO How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters? \nLEAH Or stage parents! \nBREN They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? \nULTRASOUND TECH No... I guess not. \nBREN What is your job title, exactly? \nULTRASOUND TECH Excuse me? \nBREN I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy? \nULTRASOUND TECH I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. \nBREN Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. \nULTRASOUND TECH What are you talking about? \nBREN You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there? \nBren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR. \nBREN My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade! \nThe ULTRASOUND TECH exits in a huff. \nJUNO Bren, you're a dick! I love it. \nINT. JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJuno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT. \nEXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON \nThe Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads \"Glacial Valley.\" \nEXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON \nJuno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold. \nMARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. \nMARK Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. \nJUNO I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? \nMARK No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know... \nHe gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly. \nJUNO Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck. \nMARK Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler? \nJUNO Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices? \nMARK I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs... (adding) ...They're not bad. \nMARK We definitely want it to have junk. \nJUNO Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready. \nMark chuckles. \nMARK Wait...do you hear that? \nA new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is. \nJUNO What is it? \nMARK It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing \"Superstar\" by the Carpenters. \nJUNO (excited) I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes. \nMARK You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen. \nMark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics. \nMARK (lipsynching) Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby... \nJUNO Hey, I like this. \nMARK This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave. \nJUNO You don't have to do that. \nMARK It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was? \nJUNO I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. \nMARK Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there. \nHe gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch. \nMark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the \"No Alternative\" charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone. \nJuno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up. \nJUNO (reading title) The Wizard of Gore? \nMARK (distracted) Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror. \nJUNO Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror. \nMark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised. \nMARK Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang. \nJUNO (examining the tape box) Frankly, this looks kind of stupid. \nMark gives a look - \"Oh, Really?\" \nINT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON \nWe see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore. \nMark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa. \nJUNO (watching movie) This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark. \nMARK Here's to dovetailing interests. \nHe raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly. \nJUNO So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet? \nVANESSA Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does. \nMARK Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us. \nJUNO I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises. \nVANESSA (distracted) Oh, that's great! \nShe can't divert her gaze from the photo. \nJUNO See? Nothing to worry about. \nVanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of emotion. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY \nVanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping bags from various kids stores. \nJUNO Hey, what kind of swag did you score? \nMARK Yeah. Mall madness, huh? \nVANESSA Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right. \nJUNO I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous. \nMARK I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower. \nJUNO Why? \nVANESSA Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone. \nJUNO What do you mean? You mean... (aghast) Do you think I'm going to flake out on you? \nVANESSA No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out. \nJuno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks embarrassed. \nMARK Cold feet. \nJUNO You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events. \nVANESSA (abruptly) Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home. \nJUNO Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again. \nShe waves and heads for the door. \nMARK (to Juno) Hey, don't forget your bag. \nVanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag. \nEXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT \nJuno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters. \nINT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an issue of Dog Fancy. \nJuno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie. \nBREN Where the hell have you been, Junebug? \nJUNO I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours. \nBREN A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place? \nHe nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and pours them into his mouth. \nJUNO (V.O.) Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice. When we made out, the day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious. \nINT. BLEEKER HOUSE - \"MOLD-O'-RIFFIC\" BASEMENT - NIGHT \nCU ON BLEEKER'S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME \nINT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed. \nBLEEKER So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days. \nJUNO Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents. \nBleeker is visibly relieved. \nBLEEKER Really? What are they like? \nJUNO The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today. \nBLEEKER Is that normal? \nJUNO I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe. \nBLEEKER Oh. That's a relief. \nJuno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker. \nJUNO I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge? \nBLEEKER I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful. \nJuno is caught off guard by his sincerity. \nJUNO Jesus, Bleek. \nBLEEKER Well, I do. \nThe song playing ends, and another one begins. It's \"the song,\" the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from the infamous night in the basement. \nBLEEKER Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again. \nJUNO Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. \nBLEEKER We could get back together too. \nJUNO Were we together? \nBleeker picks at the carpet, dejected. \nBLEEKER Well, we were once. You know, that time. \nJUNO What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort. \nBLEEKER I don't like Katrina. \nJUNO I totally heard you did. \nBLEEKER I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup. \nEXT. LORING HOUSE - DAY \nThe house is covered in fresh snow. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY \nWOMAN #1 And I was like, \"No offense, sweetie, but nobody looks good in gauchos.\" \nWOMAN #2 Especially not with her build. \nJUNO (mimicking the women, Peanuts-style) Wah-wah-waaah! \nOne of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve. Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play area and begins to play energetically with her. \nJuno watches intently, but Leah just snickers. \nLEAH She's gonna steal that kid for her collection. \nJUNO Right, seriously. \nThey watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children. \nLEAH Bo-ring! \nLeah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment. \nINT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER \nLeah and Juno approach the elevator. \nJUNO I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously. \nLEAH God, Spermy. Must you always feed? \nThe elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa. \nVANESSA Juno? \nJuno tries her best to look enthused. \nJUNO Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? \nVANESSA Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends. \nLEAH You're gay? \nJuno glares at Leah. \nVANESSA (confused) No... \nJUNO Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. \nVANESSA Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling? \nJUNO Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now! \nShe lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL. \nVANESSA That's great. \nVanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces. \nJUNO Dude, it's moshing all over. \nVanessa looks confused. \nJUNO (explains) It's kicking. \nVanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the courage for an unusual request. \nVANESSA Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it? \nJUNO Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale. \nJUNO Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison. \nMARK I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point. \nJUNO Consider it your musical education. \nMARK I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me. \nJUNO Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi. \nMARK Go learn something. \nMark hangs up. Smiles. \nINT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY \nCU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food. \nPull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table. \nLEAH God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now? \nJUNO Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked. \nLEAH I wish my funbags would get bigger. \nJUNO Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode. \nLEAH Hot! \nINT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY \nJuno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch. \nJuno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused. \nJUNO God, why is everyone always staring at me? \nLEAH Well, you are kind of... convex. \nShe illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach. \nJUNO Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once! \nLEAH I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately. \nJUNO Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as \"Keith,\" okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days. \nLEAH Keith's hot. \nJUNO Eww, he's all beardy! \nWe see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily. \nBACK ON JUNO AND LEAH: \nLEAH Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort? \nJUNO Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date. \nLEAH (shrugging) He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin. \nJUNO Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup! \nLEAH Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie. \nJUNO There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands. \nJUNO Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet! \nJuno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder. She's about to walk away, when... \nBLEEKER Wait, let me take that. \nJUNO Huh? \nBLEEKER You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it. \nJUNO Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds? \nShe turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no one sees) and continues down the hallway. \nEXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY \nJuno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine, then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY \nMark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive. The doorbell rings. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY \nMark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a grin. \nMARK Wow. That shirt is working hard. \nJUNO (furtive) Is Vanessa here? \nMARK Nope. We're safe. \nHe and Juno smile conspiratorially. \nJUNO Cool. \nMARK Come on, I have something for you. \nHe gestures for Juno to follow him into the house. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON \nThe Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb. \nJUNO Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful! \nMARK Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them. \nJUNO Oh God, you're one of those guys... \nMARK You're gonna like this, I promise. \nMark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner. \nMARK (extracting a bagged COMIC from the box) Here it is. \nHe shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called \"Most Fruitful Yuki.\" It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking names. \nJUNO \"Most Fruitful Yuki\"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero! \nMARK Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you. \nJuno examines the comic. \"Most Fruitful Yuki\" does resemble her. \nJUNO Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now. \nMARK Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition. \nShe GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy. \nMARK But I thought you'd be cool if... \nJUNO (interrupting) I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one! \nMARK A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father. \nJUNO (aghast) But you're old! \nMARK I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here? \nJUNO I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life. \nMARK This... (he gestures to the dank surrounding room) ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you? \nJUNO Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me? \nMARK That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore. \nJUNO Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying. \nMark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl. \nMARK I'm such an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot I am. \nHe paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly. \nJUNO Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife. \nMARK God, you're so young. \nJUNO Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes! \nJuno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at Mark. \nJUNO Oh and by the way, I bought another Sonic Youth album and it's the worst thing I've ever heard! It's just noise, man! \nShe bolts up the stairs, sobbing. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJuno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide. \nVANESSA Juno? What's going on? \nJUNO Nothing. \nIt's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries her hardest to seem serene and \"together\" in front of Juno. \nVANESSA (pretending to be calm) Mark? Why is Juno crying? \nJUNO I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later. \nShe rushes toward the door. \nVANESSA Hold on. \nJuno halts. \nVANESSA Juno, what's the matter? \nMARK She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process. \nJuno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying. \nVANESSA What did you do? \nMONTAGE: \nINT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWe push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off. \nEXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING \nBleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the stoop: \"BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL.\" \nHe walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch on the mailbox. \nAt least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the driveway. Bleeker smiles. \nEXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING \nJuno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team, ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching and jogs up to the chainlink fence. \nBLEEKER Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox? \nJUNO Yeah. That was me. \nBLEEKER Why? \nJUNO (blushes) Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint. \nBLEEKER Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front. \nJUNO You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you. \nBLEEKER You know it's okay. \nJUNO Also, I think I'm in love with you. \nBLEEKER What, you mean as friends? \nJUNO No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try. \nBLEEKER I try really hard, actually... \nJUNO No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, \"Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard\"? And it said, \"I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here\"? That was hilarious. \nBLEEKER I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time. \nJUNO Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard. \nBLEEKER It does? \nJuno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly. \nBLEEKER Wizard! \nJUNO I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you. \nBLEEKER Mine too. \nJUNO Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend. \nBLEEKER Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil. \nJUNO That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude. \nBLEEKER Can we make out now? \nJUNO Okay. \nBleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team guys in the background. \nJUNO (V.O.) There he was. \nJuno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter... and she passes out. \nEXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON \nPaulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding a video camera. \nJUNO (V.O.) I decided to not call Bleeker to tell him that I was having the baby. He had a big meet against Manteno and I didn't want him to get all worried about me and choke. \nPaulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer. \nVIJAY (admiringly) His legs are as swift as his seed. \nMRS. BLEEKER What did you say? \nBleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat. \nANNOUNCER P. Bleeker has just broken a district record in the 400. \nBleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno. \nShe's not there. \nJUNO (V.O.) But he figured it out anyway. \nBleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused. \nINT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY \nA NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby. \nThe nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator. \nNURSE Would you like to meet your son? \nPull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, paralyzed, several feet away. \nVANESSA I have a son? \nNURSE (amused) You are the adoptive mother? \nVANESSA I have a son. \nNURSE Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any time getting out. \nVanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him. \nShe feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren leaning against the doorway. \nVanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously. \nVANESSA How do I look? \nBREN (gently) Like a mom. Scared shitless. \nVanessa laughs. \nINT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY \nJuno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's not sure what to say. \nHe holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained. \nMAC Someday, you'll be back here, honey. On your terms. \nJuno nods and swallows. \n", "test1_input": "He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno. \nMARK Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap. \nMARK This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss. \nJUNO (in exaggerated, growling German accent) Geeeerta Rauuuss! \nGERTA (straight) Nice to meet you. \nMac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily. \nMAC I'm Mac MacGuff, and this, of course, is my daughter Juno. \nMARK Like the city in Alaska? \nJUNO No. \nMARK Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit. \nVANESSA I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water... \nJUNO A Maker's Mark, please. Up. \nMAC She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts. \nJUNO I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk. \nShe bares them frighteningly to demonstrate. \nVanessa stares, unflappable. \nMAC We're fine, thank you. \nMac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch. \nGERTA So, Juno. First off, how far along are you? \nJUNO I'm a junior. \nGERTA No, I mean in your pregnancy. \nJUNO Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks. \nVanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray. \nVANESSA Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then? \nJUNO Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4. \nVANESSA The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest. \nJUNO Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front. \nVANESSA I think pregnancy is beautiful. \nJUNO Well, you're lucky it's not you. \nVanessa's looks to the ceiling. \nMARK (clearing throat) So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing. \nJUNO Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right? \n", "test1_true": "MAC (protective) Wait. What does that mean? \nGERTA It means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up. Of course, Juno's legal rights would be terminated... \nJUNO Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds. \nMARK Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament. \nMark and Juno lock eyes. \nJUNO Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid. \nGERTA Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then? \nJUNO Shit, yeah. Close it up. \nVanessa is clearly ecstatic. \nMARK Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses. \nVANESSA Are you looking for any other compensation? \nMAC Excuse me? \nJUNO Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped. \nVANESSA You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us. \nMARK Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married. \nVANESSA I want to be a mommy so badly! \nJuno and Mac stare at her. \nMAC You don't say. \nVANESSA Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something? \nMAC Yes. Heating and air conditioning. \nVANESSA Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are. \nJUNO Mark, are you looking forward to being a dad? \nMark is caught off guard. \nMARK Sure, why not? I mean, every guy wants to be a father. Coach soccer, help with science projects and... I don't know. Fatherly stuff. \nMac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark. \nVANESSA Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents. \nJUNO Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit. \nVANESSA Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right... \nJUNO Room with a toilet, got it. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY/STAIRS - DAY \nJuno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY \nThe Loring's bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead cabinet and sees Vanessa's toiletries. She spritzes on some perfume and examines the more expensive grooming items. There's a crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks it up, fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs it through her hair like pomade. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \n", "test2_input": "INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY \nJuno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark trail behind. \nGERTA So, look those over and give me a call at my office if you have any questions. \nVANESSA Juno, we'd really appreciate it if you could keep us updated on any doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, other things of that nature. \nJUNO Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking. \nVANESSA So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this? \nMac STARES at Juno gravely. \nJUNO Yeah. For sure. I like you guys. \nJuno looks at Mark. \nVANESSA How sure? Percentage-wise, would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure? \nMark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor. \nJUNO I'm going to say I'm 104% sure. \nVANESSA Oh really? \nJUNO Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know? \nMAC I think that's a great idea. \nMARK That's great, right? Stellar news. Well, you guys drive safe, and we'll hear from you soon, all right? \nMAC All right, take care of yourselves. \nJuno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration. \nGERTA (overly aggressive) All RIGHT! \nVanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING \nIt is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running. \nEXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY \nBleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker. \nVIJAY Hey man. \nBLEEKER Oh, hey Vijay. \nVIJAY Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant? \nBLEEKER Yup. \nVIJAY Just like our moms and teachers! \nBLEEKER Yup. \nVIJAY Did you hear it's yours? \nBLEEKER Yup. \nVIJAY What a trip, man. \nBLEEKER I don't really know anything about it. \n", "test2_true": "BLEEKER I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly. \nVIJAY Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you. \nVIJAY jogs off. Bleeker STOPS and wipes away his sweat. \nINT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HEAD OFFICE - DAY \nWe're looking over Juno's now FIVE MONTH PREGNANT BELLY to a school administrator filling out a slip. \nJuno takes the slip, turns around and smiles all the way out. \nINT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY \nJuno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker. \nBLEEKER Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids. \nJUNO Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything. \nBLEEKER Okay, cool. \nJUNO I'll try to drop by later. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON \nSPLOOGE! We see ultrasound goo being squirted onto Juno's exposed pregnant belly. An ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN is using a Doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump. Bren and Leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image. \nThe tech takes measurements and types them into her database. \nULTRASOUND TECH That's the feet... \nALL THREE Oooh... \nULTRASOUND TECH And there's a hand... \nThe monitor reveals the baby's head. \nALL THREE (various) Check that out... No way... \nBREN (dreamily) Would you look at that? \nLEAH Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary! \nJUNO Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell! \nLEAH Touche. \nJUNO (gazing at the monitor) It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things. \nJuno and Leah look at BREN, who is dabbing her eyes discreetly. \nBREN What? I'm not made of stone. \nULTRASOUND TECH Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex? \nLEAH Aw, please Junebug? \nJUNO No way. No, I definitely don't want to know. \nULTRASOUND TECH Planning to be surprised when you deliver? \nJUNO I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if I know, I won't be able to keep myself from telling them and ruining the whole thing. \nULTRASOUND TECH (condescending) Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school? \nJUNO No, they're the people who are adopting the baby. \n", "test3_input": "After a beat, she begins to gather herself. \nINT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise. \nEXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT \nJuno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. We push in close... when she gets an idea. \nShe hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note? \nEXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nVanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her. \nMARK I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it \"collaborative divorce.\" It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children. \nVANESSA No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess. \nMark nods and sits down. \nVANESSA We're actually, finally doing this? \nMARK Looks like it, yeah. \nVANESSA Have you found a place to stay? \nMARK Yeah, downtown. \nVANESSA A hotel? \nMARK It's a loft. \nVANESSA (lightly teasing) Aren't you the cool guy? \nThey STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated. \nVANESSA I wanted a baby so bad. So bad. \nShe buries her head in her hands. \nMARK I know you did. \nThere's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door. \nEXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT \nMark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van. \nMark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute because of Juno's proficiency in \"teen girl origami.\" He holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back. \nMARK It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube. \nVanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it. \nVANESSA It's for me. \nEXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT \nJuno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting. \nJUNO (V.O.) I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while. \n", "test3_true": "INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes. \nJuno enters. \nJUNO Hi Dad. \nMAC Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been? \nJUNO Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone? \nMAC Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class. \nJUNO Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs. \nMAC No, but you know Bren. She dreams big. \nJUNO Yeah, she does. \nMAC You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you? \nJUNO I'm losing my faith in humanity. \nMAC Think you can narrow it down for me. \nJUNO I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good. \nMAC You mean like couples? \nJUNO Yeah, like people in love. \nMAC Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up. \nJUNO Dad, no! \nMAC Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy? \nJUNO Please stop now. \nMAC (persisting) Tore up from the floor up? \nJUNO Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years. \nMAC It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy. \nJuno nods in agreement. \nMAC In my opinion, the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you, the right person will still think that the sun shines out your ass.

You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in. \nHe nods toward her belly. \nMAC Obviously. \nJuno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his cheek. \nJUNO I need to go out somewhere for just a little while. I don't have any homework, and I swear I'll be back by ten. \nShe salutes and dashes out of the kitchen. \nMAC You were talking about me, right? \n"}

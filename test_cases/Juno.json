BREN'S WORKROOM - DAY \nBren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog. \nJUNO (V.O.) She's obsessed with dogs... \nEXT. BREN'S TENS - DAY \nBren's nail salon in all its glory. \nJUNO (V.O.) ...owns a nail salon called Bren's Tens... \nINT. BREN'S TENS - DAY \nBren chats up a customer as she applies a fresh coat. \nJUNO (V.O.) ...and she always smells like methylmethacrylate. \nINT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLiberty Bell coughs pitifully as Bren leans over her plate. \nMAC So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night? \nJUNO Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes? \nBren speaks in her strong city accent. \nBREN Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning. \nJUNO I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it. \nWe see Liberty Bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her dinner. \nMAC Liberty Bell, if I see one more Baco on that potato, I'm gonna kick your monkey ass. \nEXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY \nJuno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent holding a hugely oversized sign that reads \"NO BABIES LIKE MURDERING.\" \nLONE PROTESTER (chanting in extremely shy, accented voice) All babies want to get borned! All babies want to get borned! \nJuno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers. \nJUNO Uh, hi Su-Chin. \nSU-CHIN Oh, hi Juno. How are you? \nJUNO Good. I'm good. (pause) Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet? \nSU-CHIN No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating. \nJUNO You should try Adderall. \nSU-CHIN No thanks. I'm off pills. \nJUNO Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, \"Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!\" \nSU-CHIN I heard that was you. \nJUNO Well, it was nice seeing you. \nShe continues on toward the clinic entrance. \n", "test1_true": "JUNO Really? Fingernails? \nShe considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door. \nINT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY \nThe receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant women, teens and ill-behaved children. \nPUNK RECEPTIONIST Welcome to Women's Choice, where women are trusted friends. Please put your hands where I can see them and surrender any bombs. \nJuno flashes her best jazz hands. \nJUNO Hi. I'm here for the big show? \nPUNK RECEPTIONIST Your name, please? \nJUNO Juno MacGuff. \nThe receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some paperwork on a clipboard. \nJUNO (V.O.) She thinks I'm using a fake name. Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa. \nThe receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen. \nPUNK RECEPTIONIST I need you to fill these out, both sides. And don't skip the hairy details. We need to know about every score and every sore. \nThe receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers. \nPUNK RECEPTIONIST Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry. \nJUNO No thank you. I'm off sex. \nPUNK RECEPTIONIST My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie. \nJUNO Congrats. \nShe takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of \"mommy mags\" and health related periodicals. She selects an issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few moments. \nThen she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her thumbnail and spits it onto the floor. \nJuno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken... \nCUT TO: \nPUNK RECEPTIONIST Excuse me, Miss MacGoof? \nThere's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY. \nThe receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she tears off down the street, running as fast as she can. \nEXT. LEAH'S HOUSE - DAY \nLeah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs. \nLEAH What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four. \nJUNO I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails! \nLEAH Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out? \nJUNO I'm staying pregnant, Le. \nLEAH Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active. \nJUNO What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos. \nLEAH But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant. \n", "test1_id": 1293, "test2_input": "He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and pours them into his mouth. \nJUNO (V.O.) Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice. When we made out, the day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious. \nINT. BLEEKER HOUSE - \"MOLD-O'-RIFFIC\" BASEMENT - NIGHT \nCU ON BLEEKER'S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME \nINT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed. \nBLEEKER So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days. \nJUNO Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents. \nBleeker is visibly relieved. \nBLEEKER Really? What are they like? \nJUNO The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today. \nBLEEKER Is that normal? \nJUNO I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe. \nBLEEKER Oh. That's a relief. \nJuno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker. \nJUNO I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge? \nBLEEKER I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful. \nJuno is caught off guard by his sincerity. \nJUNO Jesus, Bleek. \nBLEEKER Well, I do. \nThe song playing ends, and another one begins. It's \"the song,\" the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from the infamous night in the basement. \nBLEEKER Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again. \nJUNO Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. \nBLEEKER We could get back together too. \nJUNO Were we together? \nBleeker picks at the carpet, dejected. \nBLEEKER Well, we were once. You know, that time. \nJUNO What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort. \nBLEEKER I don't like Katrina. \nJUNO I totally heard you did. \nBLEEKER I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup. \nEXT. LORING HOUSE - DAY \nThe house is covered in fresh snow. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY \n", "test2_true": "VANESSA What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake? \nMARK They're yellow. \nVANESSA Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette. \nMARK Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom. \nVANESSA I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area... \nMARK Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls. \nVANESSA What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called \"nesting.\" \nMARK Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva? \nVANESSA You should read the book. I even flagged the \"daddy chapters\" for you. \nMARK I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion. \nVANESSA And I disagree. \nMark shrugs, resigned. \nVanessa points to the nursery's largest wall. \nVANESSA That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there. \nMARK Hm. \nVANESSA Can you see it? \nMark stares at the wall, looking lost. \nINT. RIDGEDALE MALL - DAY \nJuno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel. \nLEAH Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut! \nJUNO Share the love, Tits! \nShe wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them, appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson. \nJUNO (to eavesdroppers) She's assaulting me! She's denying me fresh-baked goodness! \nLeah claps a hand over Juno's mouth. \nJUNO (muffled) Hly shht! \nLEAH What? \nJuno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind it. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is VANESSA, looking vaguely detached. \nJUNO (hushed) That's her. That's Vanessa Loring. \nLEAH Of the Penny Saver Lorings? \nJuno nods. \nLEAH No way! She's pretty. \nJUNO You sound shocked or something. \nLEAH I just thought she'd look really old in real life. \nThe women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly discuss their outfits for an upcoming party. \n", "test2_id": 1294, "test3_input": "She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy. \nMARK But I thought you'd be cool if... \nJUNO (interrupting) I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one! \nMARK A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father. \nJUNO (aghast) But you're old! \nMARK I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here? \nJUNO I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life. \nMARK This... (he gestures to the dank surrounding room) ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you? \nJUNO Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me? \nMARK That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore. \nJUNO Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying. \nMark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl. \nMARK I'm such an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot I am. \nHe paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly. \nJUNO Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife. \nMARK God, you're so young. \nJUNO Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes! \nJuno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at Mark. \nJUNO Oh and by the way, I bought another Sonic Youth album and it's the worst thing I've ever heard! It's just noise, man! \nShe bolts up the stairs, sobbing. \nINT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJuno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide. \nVANESSA Juno? What's going on? \nJUNO Nothing. \nIt's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries her hardest to seem serene and \"together\" in front of Juno. \nVANESSA (pretending to be calm) Mark? Why is Juno crying? \nJUNO I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later. \nShe rushes toward the door. \nVANESSA Hold on. \nJuno halts. \nVANESSA Juno, what's the matter? \nMARK She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process. \nJuno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying. \nVANESSA What did you do? \n", "test3_true": "VANESSA (you've been thinking?) What? \nMARK Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us. \nVANESSA What are you referring to? \nShe knows exactly to what he's referring. \nMARK I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready. \nVANESSA Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books -- \nMARK I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready. \nJuno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices. \nVANESSA (to Juno) Juno, don't worry about this. He just has cold feet. That's how boys are. The books all say the same thing. A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant. A man becomes a father when he sees his baby. He's going to get there. He'll get there. \nJuno ain't buying it. \nVANESSA (to Mark) Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay? \nMARK It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room. \nVANESSA (quietly) She answered our prayers. \nMARK (ignores the comment) Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock. \nThis stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended. \nVANESSA What are you saying? \nA long hideous beat. \nMARK It just feels a little like bad timing. \nAnother hideous beat. \nVANESSA What would be a good time for you? \nMARK I don't know. There's just things I still want to do. \nVANESSA Like what? Be a rock star? \nMARK Don't mock me. \nVanessa sighs. It's done. \nVANESSA You're trying to do something that's never going to happen. And you know what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up. If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a mother. \nVanessa looks defeated. \nMARK I never said I'd be a great father. \nWe hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict. \nEXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nJuno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON \nThe Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the shoulder. \nINT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON \nJuno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant. \n", "test3_id": 1295}

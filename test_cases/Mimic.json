{"train": "\"Mimic\", production draft, revised by Matt Greenberg & Guillermo del Toro \nM i M i C \na revision by \nMatt Greenberg and Guillermo del Toro \nJune 19th 1996 \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nFADE IN: \nTHE SCREEN \nStygean darkness. \nWet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs, walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of them. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM \nInnards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels. \nA GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld UV lamps. \nThe figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS, their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS- CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm. \nThe scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality. \nNIGHT-VISION POV \nEerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean. \nTHE TEAM OF FIGURES \nFrom their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER. \nShe carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach with a different BARCODE on their back. \nJUDAS ROACHES. \nShe kneels and opens the \nCASE \nTCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide through into the area. \nTHE NEARBY ROACHES \nreact instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin to stream toward the Judases. \nJostle and fight each other for position to mate with them. \nThey even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING. \nLATER \nA MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM. \nREVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms of the roaches, now all DEAD. \nThe Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other disposal drums. \nAt their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre: the bar-coded Judas Roaches. \nIn a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted by the chains through the manhole to \nEXT. A CITY STREET - DAY \nMIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT. \nDirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send the cars on crosstown detours. \nMounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked in a military phalanx. \nA monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the middle of the street, \"sealing\" the area with amber plastic. \nInside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS. \nThe Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28. \nAn ARM gently drapes over her shoulder. \nPETER (OS) How we doing? \nShe looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's just fought a long battle and come out victorious. \nSUSAN We'll see... \nHe offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles, shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him. \nPeter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck. \nTHE SCREEN. DARKNESS. \nA voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness. \nANCHORMAN (VO) Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan like a thief in the night, claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified. \nINT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT \nWe FLOAT through a long hospital ward. \nPeter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM \nPETER Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable... \nSusan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits. \nPETER Hiding from the hard glare of publicity? \nHe notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it up, puts it up on the hanger. \nPETER A shame.  You looked great tonight. \nSUSAN Please. \nPETER You did! \nHe sits by the tub. \nSUSAN Do you think we did the right thing? \nPETER Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo? \nSUSAN You know what I mean... \nPeter pours some champagne into the cups. \nSUSAN We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of... \nPETER (sighs) Is this a Catholic guilt thing...? \nWe hear a NEWSREADER on the TV. \nNEWSREADER (TV) ...a flawless strategy which has stopped a potential epidemic in its tracks... \nPETER You hear that?  Flawless. \nSUSAN We just don't know. \nHe offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it. \nPETER We know we saved lives. \nHe sits closer to her. \nPETER There're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you. \nBeat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her. \nPETER Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours. \nSUSAN (smiling now) We're down to a \"couple\" now, huh? \nShe pats the water, beckoning. \nPETER Oh, I don't know. People are beginning to talk about us... \nStill partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan shakes her head, laughs ruefully. \nSUSAN Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you. \nShe reaches over, kisses him. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN TO: \nEXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT \nThe WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain. \nALPHABET CITY STREETS \nEmpty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy layer of rain. \nSUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER \nA DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade. \nCRANE to see the ROOFTOP. \nWHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall, thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild with terror. \nHe looks back down the steps. \nSomething's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex shadows on the wall. \nToo many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person. \nThe man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home. \nTrembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows... something inhuman, determined to break through. \nThe metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges. \nOn the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh. \nHe searches wildly for a possible escape. \nHe reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the sidewalk. \nTwo of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the surrounding concrete. \nWHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING. \nhears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking. \nHis head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in his eyes. \nACROSS THE ROOFTOP \nWe are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's attention. \nTICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK... \nThe strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps forward and drops out of frame. \nCHUY \nHis eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow arc. \nChuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get a better view. \nGROUND LEVEL \nThe Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake. \nCHUY \nWe isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other noise FADES AWAY. \nChuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby. \nHe begins to click them together. \nImitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago. \nTHE CHINESE PREACHER \nis being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through this hole. \nCHUY \nwatches, still clicking with his spoons. \nTHE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY \nis stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing against the wall next to the vent. Impossible. \nThere is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body like a rag doll. \nCHUY \nHis spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear terrible cracking and scraping sounds. \nTHE WINDOW \nThe Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of the opening. \nCHUY \nwatches, still fascinated. \nCHUY (very low) Funny, funny shoes... \nHe starts a new wire sculpture. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN \nPeter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun. \nPeter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS. \nPETER Excuse me, ladies... \nWithout slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past them. \nEXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER \nPeter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a water fountain. \nAs he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the sidewalk. \nThe derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off. \nIntrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points to a manhole cover set among the bushes. \nPeter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines. \nThen the painted motif finally reveals itself. \nGRAFFITI \nA talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is little more than a malignant blotch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY \nA room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS -- most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a punkish young Indian research assistant. \nSusan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the model's mandible set. \nSUSAN ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles. \nShe grabs the outer mandible set. \nSUSAN See?  This little piggy will grab the prey. \nPETER Good. \nPeter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor. \nThrough the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him. \nPETER (to Josh) Get the EMT's in there, now. \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nPARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast. \nStepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of shoes. \nChuy looks back at the cop circus, amused. \nMANNY C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late. (discreetly crossing himself) Cops are bad news. Don't look at them. \nHe gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away. \nJOSH \nuses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses. \nINT. CELLAR \nPeter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar, illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene. \nIn sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character. \nJosh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads: PROUDLY MADE IN USA. \nPETER Jesus. \nHis light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall. \nWOYCHEK (from the outside) They look real sick, don't they? \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK \nCarrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons, just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever. \nSUSAN ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that. \nSIRI I'm on it.  Don't worry. (Beat) Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter. \nSUSAN (Smiles ironically) Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here. \nSIRI I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah... \nSUSAN What? \nSIRI She used a baster. \nSusan looks at her. \nSIRI Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster. \nSUSAN Oh, Jesus. \nShe tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but it rises just a little too far. \nSUSAN Come on, darlin'... \nSusan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls level to the floor. \nSIRI (continues) She kept it under her bed. Thing is, it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to hide it from her husband, but... \nA pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe box sit beside them. \nSUSAN What's this? \nSIRI Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy. \nSusan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her. \nSUSAN Hello. \nRICKY You the bug lady, right? \nSiri chuckles. \nSUSAN (smiles) I suppose so. \nRicky raises and shakes the paper bag. \nRICKY We're here to deal. \nINT. MOUNTING ROOM - DUSK \nSUNLIGHT slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live and mounted dead INSECTS, trapped in turn-of-the-century glass fronted cabinets. Davis puts his nose up against one, fascinated. \nSUSAN Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been upstate? \nShe examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens of battered butterflies. \nDAVIS Avenue B. \nSUSAN (sadly) I guess they got lost in this city. \nRICKY So, you wanna buy em? \nIt is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The OVERCOAT MAN. \nINT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE \nSusan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window. \nTheir movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and designs of the insects are beautiful. \nWe understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner. \nA PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat. \nShe takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her headphones. \nOn the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE TONIGHT. PETE. \nSusan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window. \nThere is a loud, angry BUZZING sound. \nSUSAN Siri? (louder) Siri?! \nSiri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her headphones. \nThe BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and mounting implements till we come to rest... \n...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles wildly inside. \nSIRI ...the fuck? \nSusan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves inside. \nShe slowly opens the lid. \nThe bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's nest. She moves her free hand closer. \nSUSAN (To Siri) Can you...? \nSuddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute pieces of paper fly through the air!! \nSusan slaps the lid back down. \nSUSAN (a scared whisper) Could you...help me...? \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nSiri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork dissecting board. \nSUSAN I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay? \nSIRI What is it? \nSUSAN I have no idea.  Are you ready? \nSiri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance FOAMING out of its body. \nSIRI Oh my God... \nSusan deposits the insect onto the corkboard. \nSiri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider trapping a sparrow. \nSIRI Shit!! Get it!  Get it! \nSNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger. \nSusan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously, like a crazy LP record. \nSusan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more pins to secure it down. \nSUSAN (Noticing Siri's hand) It bit you. \nSIRI No shit. \nSUSAN \nleans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown, flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed. \nIt squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh overhead light. \nSUSAN This wing configuration. I've never... \nSIRI (looking at her injury) Fuck! It broke the skin... \nSUSAN And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult. \nThe nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly. \nSUSAN My God. \nSIRI What? \nSusan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at \nTHE NYMPH'S TORSO \nwhere a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out. \nSUSAN (OS) It's breathing. \nSIRI \nshakes her head. \nEXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain. \nAcross the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window. \nINT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME \nChuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere. \nManny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame. \nHe puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV. \nMANNY Not too little, not too much. You rub it in, around and around like this. Let the leather take it. \nManny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under his tongue. \nMANNY You watching? You should learn to work the shoes. You're good with your hands... \nManny shoots a glance over to his grandson. \nMANNY Chuy...you gonna get all wet. \nChuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street. \nMANNY Did you look at the story book I got you? \nManny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK. \nMANNY Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that, Chico?  \"Friends\"? \nNothing from Chuy. \nCHUY'S POV - STREET \nThe building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the entrance. \nMANNY (OS) A friend is the one you can trust.  When you are with a friend, no matter where in the world, you are at home. \nA FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible in the rain. \nMANNY In this city. A friend is a hard thing to find... \nCHUY \nHis face shows a bit of animation. \nCHUY Funny Shoes... \nManny looks up from the book. \nCHUY Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes. \nManny comes over, looks out. \nTHEIR POV \nThe figure has disappeared into the dark front of the boarded-up building. \nMANNY AND CHUY \nMANNY No one is there. Is empty. \nChuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his. \nMANNY Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on the cross, but that is not a holy place. You understand? \nChuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't. \nMANNY Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in your head, eh? \nHe pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy turns back to stare at the street. \nCHUY Mr. Funny Shoes... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war building. Josh and Peter climb out. \nPeter is reviewing a roster. \nPETER Josh, what was Immigration's countdown? \nJosh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes and running shoes. \nJOSH Thirty-three workers. \nPeter hands him the roster. \nPETER There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster... \nJOSH Shit. \nPeter walks up the front steps. \nPETER Remember what that woman said, about people being taken? Check with the copsin the area. \nINT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPeter enters the apartment, which has long since been remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly better reception. \nPETER Sus? \nSusan walks forward. \nSUSAN We're here to deal. \nLong beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY \nA BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND. \nAt the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously nearby. \nPETER Here, let me... \nHe starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise- brown colored EGGCASE. \nSUSAN You sure you didn't see one of these? \nRICKY Gross. What is it? \nSUSAN An \"Ootheca\". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh \"weirdbugs\" inside. \nRICKY (shakes his head) No way. I see one of those, I'd puke. \nDavis opens the door with a CLICK. \nINT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM \nA dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers. \nSusan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off- limits area. \nDAVIS It was in that corner over there. \nDavis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS. \nRICKY Sucker was fast, man. (Picks up a pipe.) Had to take it out with one a these. \nPETER Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here. \nPeter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it slyly. \nRICKY Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here. \nPeter regards the little scam artist dryly. \nPETER Let's keep it at five and I won't condemn your clubhouse. \nPeter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys take off. \nPeter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket. \nDust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES where the sinks used to be. \nPETER \ninspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects: chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared heroin syringes. \nSomething shiny catches his eye. He picks it up. \nPETER (quietly) Look, a broken tooth... \nSomething rustles nearby. \nHe notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it. \nSUSAN \nkneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors. \nA SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off the tile walls. \nSusan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening. \nHer face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror. She starts pulling something out. \nPETER \nat the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it... \n...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him. \nPeter recoils. \nSUSAN (OS) You okay? \nHe nods. \nSUSAN \nturns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of beads fall away... \n...rolls under the locker... \n...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going deeper till they comes to a stop. \nSusan peers where the beads fell. \nSUSAN There's something under here. \nPeter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of beads and throws them at the base of the locker. \nCAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way under. \napproaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem to blend into one another. \nPETER Great crowd. \nSUSAN No such thing, baby. \nShe looks over at the crowd congregated around the buffet table. \nSUSAN I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids. \nPETER Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing. \nSUSAN (Distantly) Right. \nPeter looks at her. \nPETER What's wrong? \nSusan sighs. \nSUSAN Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought. \nPeter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on her stomach. \nPETER (genuinely moved) Oh, no, you were- \nSUSAN I was just late. \nSusan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant mound. \nSUSAN Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are... \nPETER Susan, we're not b- \nSIRI (OS) Susan? \nSusan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of the glass case. \nSIRI (Weakly.) I'm sorry.  I think...I need... \nOne of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady herself. \nHer fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass. \nSUSAN Siri... \nSiri collapses.  The exhibit tips over. \nPeter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND! \nSUSAN Siri! \nThe room erupts into COMMOTION. \nSusan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the floor. \nPeter gently turns her over. \nSiri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like the Chinese workers in the sweatshop. \nTuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT \nAn ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant hospital. \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY \nSiri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room. \nPeter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician. \nPETER ...I think it's some kind of systemic infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases like it yesterday. A sweatshop in Canal. \nRAYMOND (to Peter.) Okay, look.  You better come in with me.  Help me through. \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM \nRaymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri, now lying on an operating table. \nRAYMOND (To Peter) All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the dril? \nPETER It'll come back to me. \nRAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it. \nPETER Looks like a Lyme disease rash. \nRAYMOND It's not consistent with the internal bleeding. Any idea what bit her? \nPeter shakes his head. \nRAYMOND I think we're gonna need to have that specimen here. \nAn ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her throat. \nBlood and fluid leak up through the clear tube. \nABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER. \nStaring down through the circular glass deck, Susan silently observes the procedures. \nCUT TO: \nHe leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems hardly reassured. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN \nThe blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New York dragging itself out of bed. \nWe FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him. \nMANNY My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr! \nManny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind. \nMANNY Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em, Chu-chu... (He pours a glass of milk.) We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to pick some up tonight, okay? \nHe walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside. \nHis grandson is gone. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN \nSewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks. \nA WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags... \nA GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a CONTROL BOOTH above. \nWORKMAN Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D. \nSOUND of the pump coming to a halt. \nThe Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling hook into the polluted waters. \nUNDERWATER SHOT \nSpooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the filter... \n...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE... \n...and connects with a LARGER FORM. \nABOVE WATER \nThe Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a YANK, hooking whatever it is. \nHe begins pulling it up. \nA PALE FORM bubbles to the surface. \nThe Workman's face goes pale. \nWORKMAN Oh, God... \nA grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A. \nCONTROL BOOTH VOICE What's the problem? \nIt take the Workman a moment to speak. \nWORKMAN I think it's a baby! \nThe Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good) toward the edge of the tank. \nHe bends down, and now gets his first good look at it. \nThe Workman SCREAMS. \nHis grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - ICU WARD \nSusan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by several machines. \nRaymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his hands. \nRAYMOND How you feeling? \nSUSAN You tell me. \nHe smiles, gives her one of the cups. \nRAYMOND Your blood tests were all negative. You checked out. \nSusan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward. \nSUSAN What about Siri? \nRAYMOND She's stable.  I don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation... \nSUSAN You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you? \nBeat.  Raymond shrugs. \nRAYMOND Pathology's still working on the tissue samples.  If it is...it must be an errant strain.  Shorter incubation period. (Beat.) I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know yet. \nINT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM \nAt the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face, trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror. We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained. \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY \nManny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor. \nThis pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt. Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long- legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor. \nSuddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing. \nMANNY Chuy... \nManny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around his wrist and crosses himself with the razor... \n...then begins to move down the pipe. \nCUT TO: \nPLATFORM \"A\" DELANCEY \nSusan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar. \nThe crew of repairmen are leaving. \nREPAIRMAN Hey, Lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay? \nSUSAN Okay.... \nShe munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph. \nSusan turns it around... and around... Trying to find something different in the lines. \nA train roars by. \nThen she notices it: \nTHE POLAROID \nThe closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE. \nSUSAN \nGets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room. \nA whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and out. \nThen we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!! He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon lights. \nSusan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN \ncarefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers. \nShe kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a noise. \nTHE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her. \nSUSAN Peter? \nOVERCOAT MAN \nThe man's face TIPS BACK... \n...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS. \nIts multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN. \nSusan SCREAMS! \nThe thing charges, its \"coat\" opening to reveal...SIX LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly. \nSusan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known simply as \"The Mimic\" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST! \nShe's dragged screaming into the hole. \nTheir silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs, wings and pipes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. VAULTED AREA \nPeter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack. \nLeonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to \nTHE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION \nfifteen feet below. \nLEONARD I've never been this deep. This area here is the Old Armory station. They built it in the 40's. Ran out of money half-way through... \nIt's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel tracks. \nLEONARD Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go. \nEverything is gray with dust. \nPETER (O.S.) (To Josh) I want a team in here by six tonight, hands and knees with toothpicks... \nLeonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding. \nA NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound. \nKeeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends down, picks up a ROCK. \nPETER \nputting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up and sees \nSUSAN'S HAND \nHer fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE. \nSomething dark drips on her hand. \nSUSAN \nlooks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark. \nSusan GASPS. \nTHE MIMIC \nhears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her. \nSUSAN \njerks herself sideways... \nAND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK! \nSusan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back. \nThe Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself. \nSusan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing. \nCUT TO: \nJOSH \ncomes to a t-junction.  He checks his notepad for the appropriate direction. \nHe turns, heads left. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TUNNELS \nSusan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles into her grimy face.  She looks up. \nRain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above. \nSUSAN HELP!!! \nEXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT \nLife as usual on Delancey street. \nPedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front stores, boom boxes, car horns... \nThey drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice... \nSUSAN \nhears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG! \nSIDE TUNNEL \nCLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel. \nSUSAN \nlooks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the floor, lifts it. \nA HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness. \nThe Mimic's CLANGING grows louder. \nSusan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the metal lid by handles on its underside. \nThe Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her... \nSusan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid... \nWHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a second before the creature reaches it. \nThe Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused. \nINT. HOLE \nThe TICK-TICKING of the Mimic's antennae scanning the lid. \nSusan hangs from the handles on the lid, her arms trembling. \nSusan's strength gives out.  She lets go, falls. \nPIPE GALLERY \nSusan CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES. \nShe MOANS in pain. \nCLOSER - SUSAN \nsecures her position, looks down.  A seemingly bottomless pit below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS. \nThe nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach. \nShe is trapped. \nThen she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds her breath. \nA faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her. \nPeter approaches him. \nPETER For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? \nLEONARD All right, motherfucker, that's it. \nHe pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet. Inches away from a fistfight. \nPETER Shh! Shh! \nA SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the second. \nWhere is it coming from? \nPeter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip, places his hand on his .22 \nA SHADOW appears outside the archway. \nIt steps onto the platform. \nLeonard frowns. \nLEONARD (tentative) Manny?! \nThe old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A rusted crowbar in his hand. \nLeonard walks over to him solicitously. \nLEONARD My God, what the hell are you...? \nMANNY Hurry, the woman needs help! \nA shadow crosses Peter's face. \nPETER Woman? \nCUT TO: \nINT. PIPE GALLERY \nOUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness. \nREVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while Manny and Leonard grip his other. \nSusan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter. \nIt's too far. \nSUSAN (A whisper) Don't. \nPETER Listen to me:  we're getting you out. \nLeonard and Manny pull Peter back into \nINT. TUNNELS \nPeter undoes his belt. \nPETER (To Manny and Leonard) Give me your belts. \nThey obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist. \nLEONARD (to Manny, as he ties them together) What are you doing down here? \nMANNY Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere... (to Peter) Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her. \nPETER What's...? \nMANNY Just hurry. \nPeter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower himself to the nearest pipe. \nLeonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery. \nPeter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede into Hades. \nThe lifeline tightens. \nPeter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his stomach and lets the belts down. \nPETER I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming. \nBut then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! \nSUSAN No, Jesus, no. \nPETER (To Leonard) Toss the flare down! \nLEONARD I only got... \nPETER Just do it! \nLeonard lets the flare drop from his hand. \nIt falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes, spinning down to the pitch-black below. \nAnd for a split second the flame illuminates... \nTHE MIMIC \npipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! \nPETER'S \neyes grow huge. \nLEONARD What the fuck was that? \nPeter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt. \nLEONARD You better tell me what the hell's going on here! \nMANNY Hey, hey!! Take it easy!! \nPETER (to Leonard) We don't know!! We don't know what it is! \nLeonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer to the still thing. \nPETER Wait a minute- \nLEONARD Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to- \nSNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its front mandibles. \nA sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the leg like a grinder-blender. \nLEONARD GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME! \nPeter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls and writhes on the floor. \nBAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS! \nBut the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good. \nPETER Its muscles are locked. \nLEONARD (Hoarse) Oh, Jesus!! \nMANNY Wait... \nManny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws. \nLEONARD Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get it off!! \nHe lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the flammable stuff. \nPETER (Stopping him.) Hey hey hey... \nMANNY Is how we make loose the ticks back home. \nPeter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish. \nWHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP. \nPeter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR - LATER \nWe now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey Mantle above an empty worktable. \nPeter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT on her forehead. \nPeter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place. \nPETER Just keep holding it.  Can you do that for me? (No reponse.) Susan? \nSusan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress. \nMANNY (OS) Doctor Tyler? \nHe turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard. His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to stir. \nPeter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his, like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then slowly manages to release his hand. \nHe walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of his foot. \nPETER You feel anything? \nLEONARD Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out... \nPETER Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. (No response.) Look, I'm trying to help you here... \nLEONARD Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh? \nPETER I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology. \nPeter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods. \nManny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car. \nMANNY Where the hell'd that thing come from? \nPeter looks at Susan.  She remains silent. \nPETER (Quietly) A mistake. \nLEONARD \"Mistake\"?  What's that supposed to...? \nPETER It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead. \nLEONARD How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart... \nSUSAN (Quietly) It doesn't have a heart. \nPeter looks up at her. \nSUSAN Just inner chambers... \nMANNY But it look like a man. It... I saw it. \nSUSAN (an edge in her voice) The scent won't last... \nPETER That's why we should do it now. \nSusan knows they have no other choice. \nLATER \nSusan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center. \nLEONARD It's just a regular old pump switch, okay? Right by the track signal board. \nManny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them- \nLEONARD The lights come up, you pull the switch. \nMANNY I pull. \nLEONARD You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. (turns to Peter) You... \nThe two men look into each other's eyes. \nLEONARD You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it? \nPETER Depends.  You got a memo? \nLeonard's hard feelings give way to an almost imperceptible smile. \nUsing a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back of Peter's hand. \nLEONARD All right then.  You gonna find two wires.  One's green.  The other's blue... \nSUSAN \napproaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window. \nMANNY He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things... \nSUSAN Manny... \nMANNY I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... \nSUSAN We'll find him. We'll be back and find him. \nManny doesn't respond. \nREADY TO GO \nSusan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she speaks. \nSUSAN You're going to have to keep it really slow.  Their eyes react to sudden movements. \nPeter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops him. \nSUSAN Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes... \nPETER Try not to sweat? \nLeonard turns to Susan and Peter. \nLEONARD Okay, people... \nLeonard's voice comes through like a clarion. \nLEONARD (OS) ...are we ready for this? \nSusan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's an odd parody of Lamaze exercise. \nLEONARD Whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. Six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off. \nA final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get. \nHe looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand. \nPETER I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are... \nSUSAN (overlapping) That's it. That's it. Breathe easy. \nA sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face. \nPETER In the tool box under the kitchen counter... \nSusan kisses him softly on the lips. \nManny approaches.  Show time. \nSusan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control booth. \nSUSAN Open it. \nLEONARD \nbegins turning the lever crank slowly. \nSUBWAY DOORS \ngradually begin to open, and stop half way. \nThe darkness outside is alive with CLICKING. \nPETER AND MANNY \nslowly move between the opening of the door and make their way to \nINT. PLATFORM \nSpoons. \nMANNY Chuy...? \nManny follows the sound. \nBY THE TRACK \nPeter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way. He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance of color. \nHe feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax. Breathes... \nINT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM \nThe space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency. \nManny heads in further, locates the levers and waits. \nSomething pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light. \nA RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around. \nMANNY (Whispering) Nino... \nHe swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless smile on his pale face. \nMANNY Chuy... \nBY THE POWERBOX \nPeter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now to the fuse-section. \nA red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses. \nOne is still occupied. \nThe other one empty. \nPETER Dammit! \nCU - PETER'S FOREHEAD \nBEADS OF SWEAT begin to form. \nSUBWAY CAR \nSusan watches the Mimics at their feast. \nAll of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest. \nSUSAN (horrified) The scent's fading... \nSusan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight. \nLEONARD (tense as hell) What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore. \nROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM \nMANNY Nino, please... \nManny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture of \"come to me\". \nIn the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw gestures as it falls through the air. \nManny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm frond. \nIt's a wing. \nManny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls. \nThe place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic clusterfuck. \nManny is sickened. \nCHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face falls. \nMANNY Dios mio... \nThe WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING... \n...unfolding... \n...at last revealing... \nAN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution... \nIts form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to them that at the very least entrance us. \nThe thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool. \nChuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him. \nThe Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as if trying to communicate with the boy. \nChuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a perfect imitation of the sound. \nManny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy- \nMANNY (barely audible) Chuy... \nCHUY (whispers) Friends. \nMANNY NO, NO, CHUY, NO... \nCHUY Friends. \nSUSAN (Yelling to Leonard) GO!! \nSusan presses the button. The doors close again. \nLEONARD The kid... \nPETER The kid's with them!! \nLEONARD What do you-? \nPETER Go!! Just go!! \nCONTROL BOOTH \nLeonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board. \nSUBWAY CAR \nJOLTS into action. \nOUTSIDE \nThe train LURCHES forward. \nWheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re- assemble quickly, ready to attack. \nTHE ALBINO \nchanges position and charges towards the car. \nTHE MOVING CAR \nreaches a \"Y\" section.  The car moves to the track to the right. \nINSIDE SUBWAY CAR \nLeonard's eyes go wide as he sees \nLEONARD He didn't do it! \nSUSAN What? \nLEONARD Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!! \nOUTSIDE CAR \nIt keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination. \n...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and repair equipment on the tracks. \nA crash seems inevitable. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nLeonard pulls \nTHE BRAKES \nbut they don't work at all. \nFrom below the car we see the wheels spinning freely, heading for collision. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nSusan grabs Leonard from the control booth. To Peter \nSUSAN MOVE BACK!!! \nThey rush back against the opposite door. \nSTORAGE YARD - SUBWAY CAR \nCRAAASHH!!  The car BASHES into a parked section of train in a GRIN of tearing metal... \n...flips off the track... \n...and onto its side... \nThe car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air. \nINSIDE SUBWAY CAR \nAll three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter has badly damaged his right arm. \nSUSAN You all right? \nPeter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard. \nLEONARD (Simply, re: his leg) Can't feel it. \nPeter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders. They raise him up. \nOUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR \nThey move unsteadily outside. \nSUSAN Which way? \nLEONARD Across both tracks!! \nPETER Shit. \nThey head off over a concrete island in the direction of the correct track. \nFURTHER BACK \nPETER I can.  We can do this... \nHe shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL \nThe Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics. \nIt stops. \nTurns toward the elevator. \nINT. SHAFT \nSusan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by handhold. Peter is right below her. \nShe can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously with the effort. \nSUSAN We're gonna make it! \nPeter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next handhold. \nWHAM!  Something hits the gate below them! \nINT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE \nThe Mimics are tearing at the metal gate. \nThe Albino remains still, watching them work. \nPETER AND SUSAN \nSusan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts catching in her throat with the effort. \nPETER Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going, even flow! \nSusan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the next level. \nPETER C'mon... \nSUSAN Ah... \nPETER Talk to me. \nSUSAN Peter... \nSusan pulls herself up. \nSUSUAN I'm really glad I'm not pregnant. \nREVERSE \nWe look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and the Albino have gotten into the shaft! \nThe Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against opposite walls. \nSUSAN AND PETER \nSusan is crying, barely any strength left. \nPeter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is barely hanging on himself. \nLIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down. \nMIMICS \nrushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT \nPeter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next floor. \nKCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up. \nNow the elevator is coming down. \nPETER Hang onto me. \nPeter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them able to get a foothold on the ledge- \nPETER Hang on tight! \nHe begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan looks back down. \nSUSAN'S POV - SHAFT \nThe Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its mandibles. \nSUSAN AND PETER \nboth KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through to the \nINT. SUBWAY TRACK \nPETER Come on! \nPeter and Susan stumble away. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT \nThe Albino sees the elevator approaching from above. \nIt gives a few CLICKS to its minions. \nThe two other Mimics race up the shaft... \n", "test1_input": "Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN, the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY. \nSUSAN (Laughs.  To Chuy.) That's wonderful!  What grade are you in? \nChuy doesn't answer. \nERNEST No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about. \nErnest discreetly points to his forehead. \nMANNY (immediately) He's special. \nLEONARD He can imitate anything, you just watch him. \nPETER (Irritably, to Leonard) Excuse me, I'm talking to you. \nLEONARD No, you talkin' at me. \nLeonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and walks past Peter as if he were invisible. \nERNEST (discreetly, to Susan) Is there some reward for this? \nSUSAN I guess that could be arranged. \nErnest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture. \nPETER For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me? \nLEONARD You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. \nLeonard saunters away with Ernest in tow. \nPeter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm, heads off in another direction. \nChuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of their steps. \nINT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY \nSusan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes. \nPETER You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us? \nSUSAN I heard how you talked to him. \nPETER Oh, so I'm the bad guy now? \nSusan spares him an ironic look. \nSUSAN He was just doing his job. \nPETER Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus! \nAt the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by sunlight. \nPETER He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK \nA train blurs by. \nA FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls. \nA SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING. \nHe notices something off to a corner, walks over to it. \nA SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage. \nHe touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly. \nHe touches it again... \n...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him reflexively. \nErnest jumps back. \nAnother SET OF LEGS emerges... \nOddly enough, Ernest relaxes. \nERNEST Chrissakes... \nHe grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP. \nUnderneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated, toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim light, they almost seem like a single organism. \nERNEST Guys, c'mon. \nThe Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts getting annoyed. \nERNEST I told you to stick by the maintenance area. \nBAG LADY Nah... It's private property now. \nErnest looks at her, confused. \nSKELETAL BUM He eats down there. \nERNEST Who? \nHOMELESS MAN The Stickman. \nBAG LADY Long John. \n", "test1_true": "Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An arrow below it points east. \nERNEST Graffiti artist, uh? (To Homeless People) Look guys, just get off my beat, you hear?  Get moving. \nErnest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him, pick up their things and head into the gloom. \nErnest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti painting of The Stickman. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER \nErnest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in weakly from grates above. \nHe stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER. \nA SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal... \nA FIGURE crouched over something. \nWe hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds. \nCU ERNEST \nSquinting to see over his flashlight beam. \nERNEST Hey, buddy! \nNo answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and ingested.  Ernest is revolted. \nERNEST Get off my track... \nThe crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN. \nAnother distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff of hot wind that signals an approaching train. \nErnest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance. \nThe Overcoat Man stands up. \nErnest stops in his tracks. \nFor he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood. \nA dead dog. \nThe Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his chest... \n...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING FROM HIS TORSO. \nERNEST Sweet Jesus... \nThe Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He begins walking toward Ernest. \nErnest backs away. \nThe Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS PAST! \nCRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful arms. \nThrough the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the dark figure, then raised above, taken away. \nTRACK \nThe can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS. \nThe track is empty again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER \nWe PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'. \nINT. EXHIBITION FLOOR \nEXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc. \nAn opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the displays; most just camp out at the buffet table. \nPeter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her. \nPETER Heya. (Kisses her on the cheek.) Where's the boss? \nSiri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit. \nSIRI Ant mound. \nPeter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one of her eyes. \nPETER You okay? \nSIRI It's just a headache.  We were sandblasting Trump Tower here since four this morning. \nPETER Maybe you should sit... \nSIRI I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could use a good word right now. \nShe nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves. \nSiri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the insect bite on her hand. \nPETER \n", "test2_input": "Josh flashes the ultra-violet light over an abandoned underground encampment, made of cardboard walls, electrical wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. The walls are completely taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and messages. Everything from \"Kilroy was here\" to elaborate quotations from the bible. \nJOSH There's really people living down here? \nLEONARD Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street... \nTheir flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust. The air is heavy. \nLEONARD Substance abusers, mental cases... Then about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors got started... Someone found a couple of stiffs... \nThey work their way down a steep incline. They're covered in sweat. \nLEONARD Down here's the land of talk, see? So the wildest version goes the farthest. They mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed. (chuckles) We had one fella... for years said he was Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo. \nPeter's cellular rings. He picks up -big static- \nINTERCUT WITH: \nMORGUE \nSusan's got the phone up on her shoulder, clamped against her ear. Raymond's cranking out a bunch of Polaroids. Color shots of the insect, from every angle. \nSUSAN It's me. Can you hear me? \nPETER (phone, barely audible) Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing... \nJeremy goes to the fridge for a beer. \nSUSAN I have. \nThe fridge light plays over the large insects jaws. It makes out a few new ridges and valleys. Raymond snaps a couple of Polaroids. \nSUSAN I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at... \nSusan notices something weird and undefinable about the contours of the claws... But she can't put her finger on it. \nBACK AT THE TUNNEL \nPETER We'll be back at the platform in... \nLEONARD 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore. \nPETER (To phone.) 20 minutes. (Beat.) Susan? \nThe call is lost. Peter tries to change frequencies, but it's useless. \nPeter replaces the phone in his pocket.  He walks off. \nLEONARD Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now. \nJOSH What? \nLEONARD Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around. \nNo one notices the OVERCOAT MAN carving on the wall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nOn Manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has accumulated. The radio is playing a sad, elegiac Tango. \nMANNY No, no, please understand... I can't wait that long. \nLooking disheveled and tired, Manny clutches the phone, listening intently. \nMANNY Please. I write it down. (he writes) 2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean \"case number\"? Okay. So, now what?  When can you...? \nHe holds a color snapshot of Chuy sitting on a mailbox. \nMANNY No, I can't wait...no, listen... \nClick. Manny slowly hangs up. He stares at his notepad, at the number 2873. \nMANNY Hijos de puta. \nHe crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window, picks up Chuy's last wire figure- \nFIGURE, CLOSER \nAnother human-looking figure, long and thin, but with something slightly off about it. \nIt has six limbs instead of four! \nMANNY \nfrowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street. \nMANNY Mr. Funny Shoes. \nDistant thunder is heard. \nBATHROOM CABINET \nManny takes a STRAIGHT RAZOR from the bathroom cabinet, opens the blade. \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY \nSusan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up. \nA sign over the entrance says \"STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY\". Susan looks around- the area is semi- deserted, a bit creepy. \nShe takes a deep breath, descends. \nINT. SUBWAY - DAY \n", "test2_true": "Very creepy.  Susan's footsteps ECHO in the empty tunnel. She sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder- nobody is following her- \nPLATFORM \"A\" DELANCEY \nSusan observes the locker room door impatiently. A small crew of REPAIRMEN are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights. \nShe sits and waits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEEP IN TUNNEL \nPeter, Josh and Leonard walk through a darker area. The floor beneath them suddenly changes, becomes tile. \nJOSH (Sniffing) Smells like acid. \nPeter stops, looks around. \nPETER Ammonia. \nJosh walks to the right, where the smell seems to emanate from.  At last they come to \nINT. VAULTED AREA - CONTINUOUS \nJosh LIGHTS a flare, sets it on the ground, walks ahead.  The ominous RUMBLE of a subway is heard in the distance. \nA cracked WATER MAIN above.  Water dribbles to the ground. \nJOSH Peter... \nPETER Yeah...? \nJOSH There's some weird shit here. \nPETER Weird shit...? \nJOSH Take a look. \nLeonard shines his flashlight ahead. \nRevealed, quite literally, is a world of shit. \nLARGE FECES scattered everywhere:  on the floor, hanging sausage-like from the ceiling.  One can almost taste the stench of old ammonia. \nPeter puts on a rubber glove, inspects one of the fecal stalactites. \nJOSH Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird shit. (Beat) Whatever it is, it's not human. \nJosh breaks off a sample, drops it in a jar with a hard THUNK.  Leonard turns away in distaste. \nLEONARD And it needs some metamucil. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned flophouse. \nHe peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there, on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger shoeprints... \n...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints. \nMANNY Chuy... \nHe kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too strong. \nALLEY \nManny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for a way in. \nA DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns. \nSomething moves in the shadows!  Something long and thin, haloed  by the rain. \nIt moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting moment as it totters around to the rear of the building. It's The Overcoat Man! \nThe man hurries past. Manny sprints after him. \nALLEYS \nManny comes running around a pile of grocery crates. \nThere is the OVERCOAT MAN. \nCARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks, unloading produce. \nThe OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and hopping, he skitters into an alley. \nFOLLOWING \nManny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue. Once it takes effect he moves on. \nThe OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How?? It's too high!!! \nThe old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal fabric cuts his shirt. \nOn the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except for... \nA SEWAGE GRATE \nManny lifts it. \nSEWAGE PIPE \n", "test3_input": "PETER (hissing a whisper) They're coming! \nOUTSIDE \nThe shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder... \nCONTROL BOOTH \nSusan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED ROD.  The lever crank. \nSUSAN I got it! \nSusan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal shaped hole.  Perfect fit. \nLeonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and slow... \nSUSAN Hurry! Please! \nTHROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR \nThe doors begin to swing shut very slowly. \nOUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV \nsees the moving doors, starts heading for them. \nCONTROL BOOTH \nLeonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as possible. \nSUBWAY CAR \nPeter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up the closing process. \nSHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close. \nCONTROL BOOTH \nLeonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank one more time... \nLEONARD Come on, you son-of-a... \nSUBWAY CAR \nA SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON. \nSilence. \nAll four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the \nWINDOWS \ncaked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the red flares. \nTHUCK! Something BUMPS against the door. \nA machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof. \nThe car SHAKES. \nOUTSIDE \nThe dark platform is alive with phantom shapes. \nINSIDE \nSCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a nail over a chalkboard. \nTHUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides... \nAn obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car. \nPETER \nA BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face is reflected in a security window. \nCRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection. \nABOVE MANNY \nClaws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent. \nBELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD \nLarge forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in. \nSusan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of the clicking... \n...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg. \nSUSAN Oh, God. (Looks at Leonard.) The blood... \nKLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them! \nSusan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as \nIN THE SUBWAY CAR \nKLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling! \nSUSAN AND LEONARD \nemerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's shoulder. \nSUSAN His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor! \n", "test3_true": "But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions. \nLeonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around his wound to mask it. Manny helps. \nPeter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken window as a barricade. \nDespite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the scent. \nPETER It's no use! They know we're in here! \nSUSAN They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired! \nPETER Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them! \nThe whole car is now shaking and buckling. \nSUSAN Exac... \nShe looks over at the severed Mimic corpse nearby.  A realization... \nSUSAN (To Manny) Give me your razor. \nManny looks at her blankly. Susan just takes the blade. \nThe whole car is now shaking and buckling. \nShe runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice. \nShe SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor... \nPETER What are you doing? \n...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow... \n...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of softballs.  She SLICES them open. \nOrange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering. \nLEONARD (covers his nose) Shit! \nPeter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to him. \nSUSAN Rub it on the windows! \nPETER What- \nSUSAN Just do it!! \nHolding his breath, against the stench, he smears the crap on the windows, the doorframe... \nMANNY \nlooks to the roof, listening. \nAnd remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START SUBSIDING. \nSusan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink. \nLEONARD What are you putting that crap on me for? \nSUSAN Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other. \nShe smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt. \nCUT TO: \nSUBWAY CAR - LATER \nLeaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak for every Mimic he sees. \nPeter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has created a small \"model\" of the station using pocket debris and the wall map. \nLEONARD (O.S.) Okay. That's us. \nManny's lighter represents the subway car. \nLEONARD This track we're on? Goes down into the repair area. (Makes an \"X\" further down) The elevator's over here. Leads up to the active tunnels. \nTHUMP! An oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against the glass. Manny moves away. \nPETER Can we get this car there? \nLEONARD Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator. \nSUSAN But the power... \nLEONARD Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables... \nMANNY Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard? Hop? \nPETER (To Leonard) Just talk me through it. I can go with Manny. \nLEONARD It would take a minute or so. (beat) You won't last that long out there. \nSUSAN Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV! \nTense silence. He points at the glands on the floor. \nPETER We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them! \nSUSAN Peter- \nPETER It worked before... \n"}

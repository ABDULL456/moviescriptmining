The figure begins moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps forward and drops out of frame. \nCHUY \nHis eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow arc. \nChuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get a better view. \nGROUND LEVEL \nThe Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake. \nCHUY \nWe isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other noise FADES AWAY. \nChuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby. \nHe begins to click them together. \nImitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago. \nTHE CHINESE PREACHER \nis being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through this hole. \nCHUY \nwatches, still clicking with his spoons. \nTHE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY \nis stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing against the wall next to the vent. Impossible. \nThere is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body like a rag doll. \nCHUY \nHis spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear terrible cracking and scraping sounds. \nTHE WINDOW \nThe Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of the opening. \nCHUY \nwatches, still fascinated. \nCHUY (very low) Funny, funny shoes... \nHe starts a new wire sculpture. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN \nPeter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun. \nPeter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS. \nPETER Excuse me, ladies... \nWithout slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past them. \nEXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER \nPeter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a water fountain. \nAs he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the sidewalk. \nThe derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off. \nIntrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points to a manhole cover set among the bushes. \nPeter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines. \nThen the painted motif finally reveals itself. \nGRAFFITI \nA talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is little more than a malignant blotch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY \nA room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS -- most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a punkish young Indian research assistant. \nSusan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the model's mandible set. \nSUSAN ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles. \nShe grabs the outer mandible set. \nSUSAN See?  This little piggy will grab the prey. \n", "test1_true": "SUSAN Then this little piggy will tear it in half... \nAnd a third!!! \nSUSAN ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.  These are precision tools here. Can you remember that? \nThe guys nod. \nSUSAN Good.  Then get it right. \nA piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads, revealing... \n...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging sweats. He smiles at Susan. \nCUT TO: \nEXHIBITS \nPeter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ. \nPETER (teasing) \"Baby in a bottle...\" \nHe gives it to Susan. \nSUSAN Don't tease. \nAround them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff, as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an \"ARCHITECTS OF NATURE\" banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools. \nPETER You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns. \nSUSAN (laughs) Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they? \nShe gently touches her belly. \nSUSAN Trust me. I've never been this late. Never. \nShe shakes the bottle. \nSUSAN If nun's pee is what it takes... \nPeter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a larvae model from a pile on the floor. \nSUSAN You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that. \nPETER Don't get kinky here... \nPeter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits perfectly inside. \nPETER Okay, meet me out front. (to Susan) I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight. \nSUSAN I'll be late. \nHe kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group working on that sculpture. \nSUSAN Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions... \nSIRI (a wicked smile) Just like Trump Tower, then. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET \nA Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic jam. \nINT. VAN \nPeter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured, can-do guy -- drives. \nJOSH ...So I say \"buddy, you have every violation in the book.  Gimme one good reason not to close you down.\" You know what the Kraut says to me? \nIn the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging sweats and into his worksuit. \nJOSH The blintzes!  \"Try the blintzes...\" \nPETER (distractedly) Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates... \nJOSH Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. (honks furiously) We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren. \nPETER Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell \"Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!\" \nEXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY \nThe Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out. \nCOPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH badge. \nJOSH Health Department... \nThe cops let them pass. \nPETER You really love flashing that thing, don't you? \nJOSH Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want? \nTwo cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry. \nPETER Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were the first on the scene? \nWOYCHEK (gestures to Rice) We were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. Then I looked through that cellar window. We both did... \nPETER You gone in? \nWOYCHEK No. We waited. \n", "test1_id": 309, "test2_input": "SUSAN (an edge in her voice) The scent won't last... \nPETER That's why we should do it now. \nSusan knows they have no other choice. \nLATER \nSusan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center. \nLEONARD It's just a regular old pump switch, okay? Right by the track signal board. \nManny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them- \nLEONARD The lights come up, you pull the switch. \nMANNY I pull. \nLEONARD You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. (turns to Peter) You... \nThe two men look into each other's eyes. \nLEONARD You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it? \nPETER Depends.  You got a memo? \nLeonard's hard feelings give way to an almost imperceptible smile. \nUsing a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back of Peter's hand. \nLEONARD All right then.  You gonna find two wires.  One's green.  The other's blue... \nSUSAN \napproaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window. \nMANNY He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things... \nSUSAN Manny... \nMANNY I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... \nSUSAN We'll find him. We'll be back and find him. \nManny doesn't respond. \nREADY TO GO \nSusan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she speaks. \nSUSAN You're going to have to keep it really slow.  Their eyes react to sudden movements. \nPeter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops him. \nSUSAN Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes... \nPETER Try not to sweat? \nLeonard turns to Susan and Peter. \nLEONARD Okay, people... \nLeonard's voice comes through like a clarion. \nLEONARD (OS) ...are we ready for this? \nSusan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's an odd parody of Lamaze exercise. \nLEONARD Whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. Six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off. \nA final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get. \nHe looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand. \nPETER I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are... \nSUSAN (overlapping) That's it. That's it. Breathe easy. \nA sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face. \nPETER In the tool box under the kitchen counter... \nSusan kisses him softly on the lips. \nManny approaches.  Show time. \nSusan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control booth. \nSUSAN Open it. \nLEONARD \nbegins turning the lever crank slowly. \nSUBWAY DOORS \ngradually begin to open, and stop half way. \nThe darkness outside is alive with CLICKING. \nPETER AND MANNY \nslowly move between the opening of the door and make their way to \nINT. PLATFORM \n", "test2_true": "SUSAN \nwatches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics \nOUTSIDE \nLARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other. \nPeter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's working. \nPeter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER BOX. \nManny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the platform to the SWITCH ROOM. \nSUBWAY CAR \nSusan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass, filled with the bloody bandages. \nPLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS \nPeter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering to himself. \nHe lowers himself slowly to the track. \nPLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM \nManny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics. \nBY THE TRACKS \nPeter gets to the track.  He turns \nAnd is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC! \nIts antennae move toward his head, curious. \nIts human-mask face plate clicks apart and together. \nPeter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply... \nSUBWAY CAR \nLeonard has now fully opened the doors. \nSUSAN \npulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive. \nThe sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics outside. \nSusan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of the car... \n...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track. \nOUTSIDE \nThe other Mimics take instant notice. \nBY PETER \nThe Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed, it's gone, heading toward \nTHE DEAD MIMIC \nstuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow into a feeding frenzy. \nThe other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother to shreds in cannibalistic orgy. \nSUBWAY CAR \nSusan watches in disgust. \nSUSAN Choke on it, motherfuckers. \nLeonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to shut. \nPETER \nbreathes a sigh of relief. \nHe goes to the powerbox, opens it up. \nHe shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand. The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO THE GREEN WIRES. \nPETER (to himself) Green...Blue... \nHe looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls. \nAll the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic casings having long ago faded into goo. \nINT. SWITCHROOM \nManny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s style LAMPS are built into their side. \nManny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH. \nOnce there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he waves back to LEONARD. \nHe pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans against the wall. \nA CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the entrance of ANOTHER ROOM. \nIt is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL. \n", "test2_id": 310, "test3_input": "SUSAN (Yelling to Leonard) GO!! \nSusan presses the button. The doors close again. \nLEONARD The kid... \nPETER The kid's with them!! \nLEONARD What do you-? \nPETER Go!! Just go!! \nCONTROL BOOTH \nLeonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board. \nSUBWAY CAR \nJOLTS into action. \nOUTSIDE \nThe train LURCHES forward. \nWheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re- assemble quickly, ready to attack. \nTHE ALBINO \nchanges position and charges towards the car. \nTHE MOVING CAR \nreaches a \"Y\" section.

We're goin' the wrong way!!! \nOUTSIDE CAR \nIt keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination. \n...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and repair equipment on the tracks. \nA crash seems inevitable. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nLeonard pulls \nTHE BRAKES \nbut they don't work at all. \nFrom below the car we see the wheels spinning freely, heading for collision. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nSusan grabs Leonard from the control booth.

The car BASHES into a parked section of train in a GRIN of tearing metal... \n...flips off the track... \n...and onto its side... \nThe car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air. \nINSIDE SUBWAY CAR \nAll three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter has badly damaged his right arm. \nSUSAN You all right? \nPeter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard. \nLEONARD (Simply, re: his leg) Can't feel it. \nPeter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders. They raise him up. \nOUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR \nThey move unsteadily outside. \nSUSAN Which way? \nLEONARD Across both tracks!! \nPETER Shit. \nThey head off over a concrete island in the direction of the correct track. \nFURTHER BACK \n", "test3_true": "PETER AND SUSAN \ntry to hurry, but it's no use given Leonard's condition. \nLEONARD (Quietly) Lemme go. \nPeter and Susan both disregard the order. \nSUSAN We're no leaving you! \nLEONARD No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it! \nLeonard suddenly grabs his POLICE BATON from his belt clip.  He pushes the two away. \nLEONARD NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat! \nLeonard turns away from them. \nPeter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA officer is staying put. \nLEONARD Come on.  Come to poppa. \nReluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel. \nLEONARD \ntakes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FURTHER DOWN \nPeter and Susan run. \nSUSAN There. \nAn open CAGE ELEVATOR on a platform nearby.  A sign overhead: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. \nThey rush toward it. \nINT.

He glances at the third rail beside him, then down the track. \nLEONARD Come here, you mealy-mouthed... \nThe sound gets louder. \nLEONARD Multi-legged... \nLeonard raises his baton in top MTA form. \nLEONARD Maggot-munchin' motherfu... \nTHUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard! \nLeonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton. \nThey begin to tear at his limbs. \nLeonard rolls... \n...kicks his good leg out... \n...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL. \nAN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming Leonard and the Mimics. \nINT. BY THE CAGE ELEVATOR \nThe crackling sound echoes through to Peter and Susan. \nSusan hits the elevator button again. \nSUSAN I can't tell if it's working! \nPeter has unbarred the gate. \nSUSAN \nlooks up, into the shaft. \nTHE ELEVATOR \ncoming down, but it's taking its own sweet time. \nSUSAN Oh, come on, come on! \nPETER Jump in. \nPeter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate behind them. \nINT. SHAFT \nA skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a handhold. \nPeter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.

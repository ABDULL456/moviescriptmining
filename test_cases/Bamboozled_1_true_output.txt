Delacroix nods. 
MAN (CONT'D) Don't need yo money for drinks. Besides, she's drunk already. C'mon, let's go. 
The guy grabs his friend by the wrist and drags her kicking and screaming out the room. 
CLOSE ON JUNEBUG 
JUNEBUG Don't bring your woman out if you can't keep her in deep check.  If my woman ever did something crazy like that I'd put my size 12 dead up in her ass. 
This gets the biggest laugh of the night. 
EXT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Delacroix knocks. 
JUNEBUG (O.S.) What do you want? 
DELACROIX I want to speak with you. 
JUNEBUG (O.S.) Go away, unless you got my money. 
DELACROIX It's me, Peerless. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM 
He enters into a closet, it's a makeshift dressing room.  A younger lady, much younger than Junebug - DOT - stands behind him as she massages his neck. 
Junebug gets up from his chair, rushes to his son and they embrace. 
JUNEBUG Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya. 
DELACROIX It's been a long time. 
JUNEBUG Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT. 
DELACROIX Pleased to meet you. 
DOT Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about. 
DELACROIX Is that so? 
JUNEBUG Honey, pour me and my son a drink. 
They both sit down as drinks are poured. 
DOT I'll leave you two alone. 
She kisses Junebug on the forehead before leaving. 
JUNEBUG Good woman.  I trained her right. 
DELACROIX Daddy, she's younger than me. 
JUNEBUG My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic. 
He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp. 
JUNEBUG (CONT'D) Purely for medicinal purposes. 
DELACROIX I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped. 
JUNEBUG I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink. 
DELACROIX How did you end up here? 
JUNEBUG How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy? 
Delacroix takes a sip of his drink. 
DELACROIX That's what I'm askin'. 
JUNEBUG Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do. 
DELACROIX Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors. 
Junebug pours himself another stiff one. 
JUNEBUG That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic. 
DELACROIX Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back? 
JUNEBUG All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category. 
He downs another one.  Junebug drinks like a fish. 
JUNEBUG (CONT'D) Enough about me, what's happening with you? 
DELACROIX The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through. 
JUNEBUG Dem white boys giving you a hard time? 
DELACROIX Nuthin' I can't handle. 
JUNEBUG The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle. 
DELACROIX Where do you go from here? 
JUNEBUG Three nights Charleston, South Carolina. 
DELACROIX I didn't mean that, in life. 
JUNEBUG In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?

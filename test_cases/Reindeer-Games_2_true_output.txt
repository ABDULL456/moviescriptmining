The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his leg. 
Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes. 
RUDY Don't do it ... 
The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor. 
EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS 
The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops. 
The door opens. And Rudy steps out. 
The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter. 
The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's Ashley. 
She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them shivering. Both of them standing there. 
And finally: 
RUDY You Ashley? 
Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles. 
RUDY I'm Nick. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY 
Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on. Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside. 
Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them. 
She's watching him in silence. 
RUDY I like your coat. 
Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own: 
RUDY This -- this is just something they gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing when we signed up, y'know? 
Ashley nods. 
RUDY How's your coffee? 
Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down. 
ASHLEY Good. 
Rudy nods. Silence again. 
RUDY Gotta be ten degrees out there. 
ASHLEY Radio said negative five. 
RUDY Negative five? 
ASHLEY Yeah. 
RUDY I don't think it's negative five. 
ASHLEY Radio said. 
Beat. 
RUDY Wind chill. That's probably what they meant. 
Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip. 
RUDY I was scared. Scared you were gonna take one look at me and change your mind. Scared I was walking into heartache. All those words... you put a picture in your mind of where they come from and when you see where maybe it's not the same as your picture. 
He trails off. 
ASHLEY I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way -- 
RUDY No, no -- 
ASHLEY Saw my outfit or something, my coat -- 
RUDY No, hey, I like your coat -- 
ASHLEY Saw me -- 
RUDY Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here. 
ASHLEY You are to me. 
Rudy goes silent. Whoa. Ashley considers. 
ASHLEY Thought you wrote you had a mustache. 
RUDY I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to -- 
ASHLEY No, no, no. Be like you want to be. 
Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white mustache. He stares straight-faced.

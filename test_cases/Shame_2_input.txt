SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued- 
Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a woman legs splayed- 
FROM SCREEN Hey, where's Brandon? Are you Brandon's girlfriend? Do you want to play? 
SISSY looks closer, mildly appalled. 
FROM SCREEN (CONT'D) Do you wanna play with my tits? I know Brandon would really like it.. And I know exactly what Brandon likes. 
BRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom. 
SISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment. 
74   INT. BEDROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              74 
LATER- 
The thump of music- 
BRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder, hands grasping his hair. Then suddenly he enters the whole contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag. 
Then, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone numbers on the back. 
BRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts. 
He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the floor. He picks it up, moving on. 
75   INT. KITCHEN. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              75 
An open fridge- 
BRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by date mush into the bag. 
Cans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an old joint, magazines all get dumped on route. 
BRANDON heads out, picking up more detritus along the way, old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones- 
A pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads down along the corridor. 
76   INT. LIVING ROOM. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                          76 
BRANDON strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers smelling and cracked from under a chair. He peers up, looks around the room almost bare- 
His laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers, initially resistant and then something finally compels him to do it- 
He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall. Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff. Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the heaving bag of crap out into the corridor. 
The SLAM of the front door- 
77   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       77 
BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up along the street in waiting for collection. 
Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk. 
A SIREN goes past- 
The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS. 
BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door firmly. 
78   INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  78 
BRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable. 
Suddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately. 
She responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She surrenders. 
They pull away, looking at one another. She smiles, laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on. 
BRANDON Come on. 
BRANDON leads MARIANNE away. 
79   EXT. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                                  79 
BRANDON and MARIANNE stepping out of a cab, BRANDON leading MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping.

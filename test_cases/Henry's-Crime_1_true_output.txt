VOICE (O.S.) I see you guys in the bank. I see you guys in the alley next to the bank. They turn. FRANK, the bank guard, is standing right there. He's in his street clothes. 
FRANK Now I see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank. Frank sucks his teeth. 
FRANK (CONT'D) I know what you're up to Gentlemen. Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them. 
FRANK (CONT'D) And I want in. 
MAX In on what? Frank snickers. 
FRANK We can't talk here. Let's drive. Max looks at Henry. 
INT. JOE'S CAR - DRIVING 
Joe's driving. Max is in the passenger seat. Henry in the back next to Frank. 
HENRY What's on your mind, Frank? 
FRANK The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange. They exchange glances. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in Canada, picks up all the currency and brings it back home. They're listening... 
FRANK (CONT'D) I'd say on average eight to twelve million, held in our vault at First Buffalo for just a few hours before it's picked up for redistribution. Now they're paying attention. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time. A beat. He leans closer... 
FRANK (CONT'D) I can give you that date. I can help with alarms. I can be your guy on the inside. 
MAX Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to...which you're not. But just say...why would you help us rob your bank? 
FRANK I got my reasons. 
JOE This sounds like a set-up, man -- Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes. 
FRANK I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I got my reasons. 
MAX Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them. A beat. 
FRANK The wife got sick a few years ago. Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs. So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help cover the difference. We were going to retire to the Loire valley. 
(DARKLY) We had to use all our savings to cover the bills. 
JOE 
(GETTING IT) The man gave it to you, huh. 
FRANK I spent everything we had -- then she died...thirty years I've been at that bank. 
HENRY What was her name? 
FRANK Annie. Her name was Annie. 
HENRY I'm Sorry. The moment just hangs there... 
FRANK November 23rd. The money's delivered at eight and picked up at midnight. He turns to Henry. 
FRANK (CONT'D) I retire in two weeks. This is it. 
(THEN) You set up the table. I make sure dinner arrives hot. 
EXT. THEATRE - MORNING 
MAX and HENRY walk up to the theatre. They've got coffees. It's drizzling. They both look up. 
HENRY Shit. ON THE MARQUEE : "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM" 
HENRY (CONT'D) Opening night. 
MAX And? 
HENRY That's soon. 
MAX We're going to have pull some nights. Henry thinks... 
HENRY Maybe we should wait. Do it closing night. 
Max turns. 
MAX We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal. 
(THEN) I told you there were going to be tests, Henry. Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max. 
MAX (CONT'D) You're going to have to leave her. 
(BEAT) No looking back.

SAMANTHA (O.S.) No problem. 
Dad pulls up in his car, arriving to pick them up. 
DAD Hey, alright! Looks good! How many you got left, two? Alright, alright, we're done. Let's get out of here. Come on, Sam. 
Dad spots a McCain sign in the front yard across the street. 
DAD (CONT'D) (to Mason) Go get that McCain sign, would you? 
MASON (hesitating) What? 
DAD Get the McCain sign! Go rip it up, come on! Get it, get it, get it... Go! Go! Go! 
Mason runs across the street to grab the sign. 
DAD (CONT'D) Good job, buddy. Yeah. Proud of you, son. 
Dad closes the stolen sign into the trunk of his car, before the three of them drive off down the street. 
SAMANTHA You guys are gonna get us arrested. 
DAD Hey, look. I'm a patriot, alright? Sometimes in this life, you gotta fight. 
INT.   BOWLING ALLEY CAFE - EVENING 
They sit around a table talking. 
DAD (O.S.) And what is it that you do at these parties? 
SAMANTHA I don't know... talk, dance, listen to music. 
DAD Uh-huh. And that's more fun to you than going camping with your brother and your father who love you? 
SAMANTHA Yes.   Sorry. 
DAD Wow.   Is there gonna be alcohol there? 
SAMANTHA Probably not. Maybe some of the seniors. 
DAD Mm-hmm. I know what this party is. The parents are out of town, right? Somebody's uh, scored a keg, right... You guys are gonna have a good time, trash the whole house... Right? Am I right? 
SAMANTHA No. 
DAD   (O.S.) No?    No? 
SAMANTHA No, Dad.     Amy's really responsible. 
DAD Mm-hmm.      Who's gonna be there? 
SAMANTHA Marie, Christine, Amy... Everyone. 
DAD Is uh, is that guy on your Facebook page, is he gonna be there? Hm? 
SAMANTHA Who? 
DAD Come on, the guy that has got his arm wrapped around you with his hair over his eyes and -- 
SAMANTHA Garrett? 
DAD Garrett, is that his name?     Alright, is Garrett gonna be there? 
SAMANTHA Probably? 
DAD Probably. (to Mason) Uh-huh, you see? I learn more about her from her Facebook page than I do from our scintillating conversation. (to Samantha) Is he your boyfriend? 
SAMANTHA Kind of. 
Dad turns to Mason for further information. 
DAD Have you met him?       Has he been around the house? 
MASON Sometimes. 
DAD Sometime-zz?     Zzz? 
Dad turns his attention back to Samantha. 
DAD (CONT'D) You have a boyfriend... Wow.       Have you heard of Sarah Palin? 
SAMANTHA Yes. 
DAD What's the one thing that you know about Sarah Palin's seventeen year old daughter? 
SAMANTHA She's pregnant? 
DAD That's right. And what is the one thing that you are not going to be in a couple of years when you turn seventeen? 
SAMANTHA Pregnant? 
DAD That's right! Alright, now what are the, the two ways that you can achieve that goal? The first is... not have any sex. Okay? That's the first way. Okay? Just not engage in that. That did not work out very well for your mother and me. And what's the second way? 
Mason stands to leave the table. 
DAD (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
MASON Bathroom. 
DAD You don't have to go to the bathroom. Sit down, Mason. Just... Just sit down. What's the second way? Alright? Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff? 
SAMANTHA Oh, Dad.    Dad. 
DAD No, come on. Has she talked to you about... contraception? 
The kids are visibly uncomfortable with the conversation. 
DAD (CONT'D) Huh? What has she -- condoms?    Has she talked about that? 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) Oh, Dad.    Please! 
DAD What?   What? 
SAMANTHA That's enough. 
DAD Well.    Does Garret have a condom? 
SAMANTHA Ohh!    God!   Dad! 
DAD What? What, come on Sam. We have to be able to talk about this. Alright? Come on, we do. We can do it. We can do it. Just stay with me here. Alright? It's as hard for me as it is for you. But, seriously though, alright, I read an article in the paper the other day... that said that although U.S. teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy. Okay? 
A woman, TAMMY, walks up to the table, interrupting their conversation. 
TAMMY Hey.    What's goin' on? 
DAD Oh, hey.    Hey, Tammy.    How you doin'? 
Dad stands to greet Tammy. 
TAMMY Nice to see you. 
DAD Wow, yeah, good to see you. Um, Tammy, this is my daughter Samantha. 
TAMMY Hey.

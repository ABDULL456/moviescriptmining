Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing -- CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world... \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nA CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to: \nEXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN \nPOV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES: \nSPECIAL FORCES LEADER We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch. \nINT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT \nSUPER: \"JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON\" Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American; eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated). \nCOLONEL THOMPSON Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero. \nEXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN \nThe Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent. \nINT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS \nAn airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away: \nPENTAGON TECHIE #1 We have system control. \nCONTINUED: \nCOLONEL THOMPSON Activate laser mic. \nEXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS \nDRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield -- \nINT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY \nOver speakers, VOICES speak \"Balochi.\" A TRANSLATOR listens: \nCALLISTER Is it him? \nTRANSLATOR Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshani\u00e2\u0080\u00a2dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei. \nCOLONEL THOMPSON Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a \nBEARDED MAN: \"37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI.\" \nCALLISTER I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room: \nDIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road. \nTECHIE Sire they're pulling off the highway. \nTECHIE #2 We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: \"RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION.\" The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery. \nCOLONEL THOMPSON If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go. \nCALLISTER (beat, torn) Alright, stay with him... \nCONTINUED: THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune. \nEXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY \nMothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site -- \nTECHIE We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles -- \nCOLONEL THOMPSON Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: \"5I$ PROBABLE MATCH - \nJERRY That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating. \nKWAME -- what? But she said the collator's broken. \nJERRY And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his NAMETAG: \"JERRY.\" Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up: \nJERRY (CONT'D) Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF: \nINT. \"EL\" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING \nThe KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an \"electronic elsewhere.\" And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims: \nSHEPARD SMITH a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH: \nCONTINUED: \nSPOKESMAN Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world... \nEXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING \nAn ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his attention: \"INSUFFICIENT FUNDS.\" He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, \"FUCK,\" it says \"FUCK 1 KNEW IT.\" \nINT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING \nSaying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO: \nINT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING \nA DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming: \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry. \nJERRY Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God -- \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes? \nJERRY (puts cash in her hands) -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him -- \nINT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table. \nCONTINUED: \nJERRY So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far --- \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands. \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) You are hungry, I am guessing. \nJERRY Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- (looking down at bowl) Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine. \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI So where is girl? I don't see her? \nJERRY Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart. \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI Like the others. \nJERRY Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered. \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up. \nJERRY Your -- I'm like your dog? \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly: \nJERRY why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup -- \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse. \n(MC)RF ) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. (hands Jerry the cup) You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit: \nJERRY This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning -- \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices. \nMRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly: \nKYLE You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!! \nRACHEL: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab -- \nINT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY \nA CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them -- \nRACHEL Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!! \nWAIT!! Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles: \nMRS. MILLER Under the wire -- \nRACHEL (gulping breaths) Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met-- \nMRS. MILLER -- of course, Barbara Miller. (looks at watch) You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her -- \nCONTINUED: \nRACHEL Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time -- \nKYLE I will, mom -- \nRACHEL -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- (turns to Mrs. Miller) He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight -- \nMRS. MILLER I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto -- \nRACHEL You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more -- \nKYLE It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya.. \nRACHEL Fun? What's that? (hugging him) I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house. \nKYLE -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller: \nRACHEL Call me! \nMRS. MILLER Your mom gonna be okay? \nKYLE It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA... \nCONTINUED: (2) We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: \"HASSAD DRY CLEANERS.\" Loads the trumpet inside as we: \nINT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON \nSolemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES: \nWOMAN #1 (V.O.) you didn't know either? \nWOMAN #2 (V.0.) No idea. \nWOMAN #3 (V.0.) I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was... \nWOMAN.#1 (V.0.) I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him: \nWOMAN #1 (CCNT'D) when was the last time they saw him? \nWOMAN #2 Margaret said years... \nINT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY \nTROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him... \nCONTINUED: It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment. \nWILLIAM Six months without a boo or a bah. \nJERRY Didn't realize it'd been that long. \nWILLIAM Your mom was worried. So where were you this time? \nJERRY Nowhere. (then, a touch reticent) Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p- \nWILLIAM -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world. \nJERRY I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears: \nWILLIAM You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket: \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) I want to give you some, uh... \nJERRY If you're asking if we were the kind of freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul traveled a lot, so we didn't -- \nCONTINUED: \nMORGAN Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting places. \nJERRY What're you... saying. \nMORGAN I'm just saying you didn't talk much. maybe you did. \nJERRY Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause didn't hear my rights read to me-- \nMORGAN You familiar with the slogan, \"Declare War on War?\" \nJERRY what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon crossed out in red: \"DECLARE WAR ON WAR!\" \nMORGAN Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group \"Project Underground\" at Berkley. \nJERRY (stares-at pic; LAUGHS) Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an \"Anti-Oxygen\" rally for her. I swear to God, dude-- \nMORGAN Don't \"dude\" me. I'm not your friend. I don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd you drop out of school? \nJERRY Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I didn't really see the point. \nMORGAN You haven't been able to hold a job \nJERRY Unless I've been fired from Kinko's, which is a statistical impossibility, I'm holding a job right now. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMORGAN Construction work, bartender in Singapore, telemarketing, real estate office, messenger, supermarket sign painter, taxi driver, gas station in Florida, fishing boat in Alaska-- \nJERRY -- what can I say? Guess I haven't found myself yet -- \nMORGAN Who deposited the seven-fifty? \nJERRY For as second I thought God, maybe. The ATM was obviously broken -- or do.. accidents not happen in your . universe? \nMORGAN JERRY The money originated from the --this is all -- listen, this HSBC bank of Singapore -- is all very interesting -- but opened with a transfer from a this has nothing to do with corporation called 'The Star me!

Just curious if you knew any of Paul's friends in Beirut, or if he knew any of your friends -- what do you mean in Singapore, oh but that's \"friends\"?! right, we haven't really established whether or not you two were close-- (losing it) -- I guess we were rett close when I looked into his open casket this morning and saw the bad make-up job covering the gash in his skull! Or how about when I watched him being lowered into the ground -- that establish anything for you?! Somebody set me up! Morgan stares at him, unmoved. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMORGAN \"Somebody.\" Who? \nJERRY A woman, I don't know! She called me and told me I was gonna be arrested. GET \nREAL, MAN! DO I LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST TO \nYOU?!?! \nMORGAN No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we caught in Afghanistan. Except his real name was Johnny Walker Lindh. Grew up in Marin County with a basketball hoop in his driveway and a carton of Tropicana in his fridge. He was blonder than you.. though. \n(RISES) When I come back, you'd better tell me who you work for-- And heads out the door, SLAM! Jerry yells; \nJERRY \nI WORK FOR KINKO'S!!. \nINT.

They've all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket: \nLATESHA He fits the profile: disaffected, 'susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn't vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he's not a player. He does sketches of his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying about the woman who called him -- we checked the records, no calls came in before we picked him up -- \nKREBS What about the brother? \nLATESHA Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in Crystal City. \nCONTINUED: \nMORGAN That kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying \"coincidence?\" \nKREBS So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or a dumbshit mule. \nGRANT (eager to contribute) Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle about him or the gear. He's not exactly a pro-- Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring out the next move: \nKREBS Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel; and let's dryclean family and friends. Again. (to Morgan, veiled \nTHREAT) I don't want the FBI rushing in on this.

Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS: \nLATESHA Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him: \nLATESHA (CONT'D) My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble.

PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nTHE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor \"B-35.\" Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked \"B- 36.\" It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing: \nINT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS \n12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance system.

On screen, a narrated \"virtual tour\".of the hotel: \nTV VOICE dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort... \nBELLHOP Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS. \nJERRY Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him. \nRACHEL This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here? \nCONTINUED: \nJERRY Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar.

Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes... \nWOMAN'S VOICE The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance. \nRACHEL Where are we going now? \nARIA We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face. \nJERRY (trying to process) No, he worked for the State Department..: \nARIA Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman. \nJERRY What's the hell is a 'Horseman'? \nINT. MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS \nSCOTT You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it.

There were :four of us... til Paul died.

As in: \"Did you notice him acting strangely?\" \nSCOTT Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except... \nLATESHA Except what? \nCONTINUED: \nSCOTT The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP: \nARIA (V.0.)

That is not your concern right now. \nRACHEL Are you kidding me? \nJERRY Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother. \nARIA (V.0.) I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious: \nARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Your brother succeeded in everything he did. \n(MNRF) \nCONTINUED: \nARIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it -- \nARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow. \n(BEAT) And because you've seen what happens to deserters. \nRACHEL -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK. \nARIA (V.0.:) You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open. \nARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Use it.

Rachel watches him an emotional beat... \nRACHEL \n(SOFTLY) Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door.

MAINFRAME TANK - B-36 - DAY \nLatesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott typing at.the console. A MACHINE ARM drops down from above, spider-like.: The device animates as a CRANIAL SCANNER opens: \nSCOTT Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: \"PROCESSING FOR MATCH... HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT.\" Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) (clicks on mic) Aria, go voice active, please. \nCONTINUED: \nARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)

Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera -- \nLATESHA There's no feed from inside here? \nSCOTT No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel. \nSCOTT (V.0.) (CONT'D) So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLATESHA Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera. \nLATESHA (CONT'D) Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE -- \nSCOTT Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP -- \nARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.) I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze. \nSCOTT Negative, I'm prioritizing this. \nARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly: \nLATESHA It's like he's trying to say something... \nSCOTT A code. He's blinking code \nLATESHA It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it -- \nRACHEL -- Paris? \nARIA (V.0.) Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C. Move quickly. \nEXT.

Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view... A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching: \nRACHEL (a murmur) she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back: \nTSA AGENT Can't be too careful. \nJERRY (forces a smile) You're doing a great job.

Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes: \nGET ON THE SLIDEWALK. They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES: \nTAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT. Above a door, the \"EXIT\" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up, too late; the door's shut again. Sees an AIRPORT JANITOR -- \nMORGAN (CONT'D) Open this NOW! The janitor quickly swipes his ID through the keycard scanner, but it BUZZES RED. Aria's locking them out.

PENTAGON - MAINTENANCE AREA - DAY \nDEAFENING NOISE: blow torches, steam pipes, radios, and a huge CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as Pentagon detritus gets recycled. Latesha and Scott hurry in -- MOVING through quickly -- scanning -- when they SEE it: a forklift whirring towards the. compactor carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers. Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped. Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly: \nLATESHA SCOTT Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything. \nLATESHA We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor \nCOMPACTOR OPERATOR Lady, you can't do that! \nLATESHA The hell I can't! Come on! Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God- knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers, turning them over, shaking them, looking inside-- \nSCOTT Shit, there're hundreds of them... \nLATESHA keep looking, it's here... \nCONTINUED: WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction. The operator looks at the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep ploughing through the tanks as... THE ARM MOVES AGAIN. And this time Latesha heard it. Looks up.

Grabs Latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back-- \nSCOTT Latesha! -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the operator runs up to her, beside himself -- \nOPERATOR I don't know what happened! It wouldn't stop! Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her. \nSCOTT -- you okay? Jesus (but her eyes are LOCKED on the Cameras) Latesha? \nLATESHA yeah. I need to get out of here. \nSCOTT Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on -- As they start walking out.

COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures: \nCOLONEL THOMPSON Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying: \nWEAPONS DEVELOPER Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger. \nCALLISTER What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? (half smile) A song on a radio? A howling dog? \nWEAPONS DEVELOPER No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce. \n", "test1_id": 2787, "test2_input": "CONTINUED: \nCOLONEL THOMPSON Fine job. \nWEAPONS DEVELOPER Thank you, sir.

HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY \nLatesha walking down a hallway. Endless miles of shiny marble and military paintings. Her CELL RINGS. It's Morgan: \nMORGAN (V.O.) Whaddya got? \nLATESHA \n(SOTTO) Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit? They brought me all the way to the Pentagon. Paul Shaw wasn't State -- \nEXT.

Black-file: classified B-36. \nMORGAN B what? \nINT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS \nShe turns a corner. DOWN THE HALLWAY a PHALANX of GENERALS, MILITARY PERSONNEL and SCURRYING ASSISTANTS heading towards a set of DOUBLE-DOORS. Some very big meeting about to happen - \nLATESHA That's the point. No one'll tell me. I cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing. Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any feathers. I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a -- WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over her -- \nMP Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to -- When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go. \nM.P. -- sorry. \nLATESHA (to M.P.) Everybody in this place have a six-foot height requirement? (continues walking; back to Morgan) Anyway.

Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is it. Before suddenly rushing forward and calling out -- \nLATESHA Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The doors close in Latesha's face. \nLATESHA (CONT'D) Well, shit. \nINT. DRY CLEANING VAN - CITY STREETS - INDIANAPOLIS - DAY \nThe van speeds down a highway, passing a sign: \"WELCOME TO INDIANAPOLIS: YOUR HOME TOWN!\" Jerry drives, pensive. Rachel stares out the-window, the shock of what she's seen only fueling her rage at the whole situation. \nJERRY how old is he? Your son. \n", "test2_true": "JERRY What's he doing on a train? She really doesn't want to talk. BUT: \nCONTINUED: \nRACHEL He goes to a music magnet. His school's on a tour of Washington. They're playing at the Kennedy Center. \nJERRY wow. And you. Hm. She turns to him. Eyes burning into the side of his head. Knows what he's thinking. \nRACHEL Parents weren't allowed to go... is that okay with you? \nJERRY Is it okay? I could give a shit. \nRACHEL Then what's with the qualified nod? \nJERRY I'm not allowed to nod? \nRACHEL Not if you're iudging me.-- \nJERRY. Judging?! I'm just making conversation. \nRACHEL You think I should have gone with him anyway. \nJERRY I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it. \nRACHEL Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there? \nJERRY Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad? \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRACHEL As if it's any of your business -- you know what you are --? \nJERRY Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than you --? \nRACHEL -- you're one of those \"thirties are the new twenties\" man-children.

Is that you don't know the first thing about me! \nRACHEL I know you work at a copy store! What are you, thirty-one, thirty-two? You're obviously articulate \nJERRY -- love being stuck in a van with my fucking guidance counselor -- \nRACHEL -- and I know your brother just died and he worked for the State Department -- \nJERRY -- you need to stop talking about my brother, I've had enough of that -- \nRACHEL JERRY -- you're in denial if you -- Ham: I'm not talking about don't think that has anything this -- to do with what's happening right now -= -- Dammit!! I'm not kidding! :but I can tell you that Stop! STOP! whatever he did, whatever he was part of has put my son in danger whether you believe it or not!! SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb, pops open the door. \nRACHEL \nJESUS!--WHAT'RE YOU D--?'. Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut -- \nCONTINUED: (3) \nRACHEL (CONT'D) You can't leave me! \nJERRY Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door \nRACHEL Don't walk away! \nJERRY (throwing up arms) I'm done. \nRACHEL Please! \nJERRY You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin : \nRACHEL Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear. \nJERRY I'm sorry? What'd you just say? \nRACHEL I can't do this without you. \nJERRY You mean without the \"man-child?\" Rachel's reserves crumble. \nRACHEL Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train-- (almost whispering) -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her. \nJERRY No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again -- \nCONTINUED: (4) \n", "test2_id": 2788, "test3_input": "RACHEL Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van. \nEXT. TOWER 108 - DAY \nTHE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM. Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene. \nPOWER WORKER Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared. \nSHERIFF No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. (points off) Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints. \nMORGAN And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call: \nAGENT GRANT Agent Morgan!\" (out of breath, sotto) Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice. \nMORGAN Inside?! You absolutely sure on that? \nAGENT GRANT Yes, s-- (catches himself) Yes I am. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS -- \nGRANT Looks like a bone mic, military grade. \nCONTINUED: \nMORGAN Can't even get these things on the black market. (looks around landscape) Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him: \nSHERIFF We'll be needing that for evidence! \nEXT. 56TH STREET - DAY \nJerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves for the inevitable... \nRACHEL a Federal bank? \nJERRY Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison. \nINT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY \nA wall-mounted clock ticks to \"11:00\"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES: \nMANAGER Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box. \nJERRY (WHAT THE FUCK?! then:) yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: \"SAXON, CARL.\" Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN. \nINT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY \nThey exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX. He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle Eastern Man gave Jerry: \nCONTINUED: \nMANAGER Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box. \nRACHEL You gonna open it? \nJERRY Maybe it's not gonna be so bad. \nRACHEL Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: \"EAR:MIC. NOW.\" \nJERRY RACHEL Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear: \nWOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know: \nRACHEL -- what?! \nJERRY -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Excellent. \nRACHEL What now -- what are we? \nBUT THE VAULT NEXT DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS-- \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJERRY RACHEL -- they're coming--we're supposed to rob them -- -- are you kidding me?!?! (hands her a GUN) -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even let Kyle play with water guns! -- hey, I applaud your parenting skills -- take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and REACTS, going for his gun: \nJERRY Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly -- \nJERRY (CONT'D) Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case. \nCOURIER #1 You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that. \n", "test3_true": "RACHEL \nDROP THE GUN ASSHOLE!

They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it. \nJERRY RACHEL impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO: \nINT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY \nAlone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle: \nRACHEL JERRY -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?! \nWOMAN'S VOICE You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now: \nJERRY Would you stop doing that?! \nWOMAN'S VOICE There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed. \nJERRY (calling out) Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN-- \nINT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY \nTWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING -- \nRACHEL How do I look? \nJERRY Like you got into a fight. Me? \nRACHEL Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing. \nJERRY Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Two jerseys and two hats, please -- \nVENDOR Peyton or Vinatieri? \nJERRY (shit!!!) I don't know what that means -- \nRACHEL Jerry... \nJERRY (shit... shit...) Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel-- \nJERRY (CONT'D) Put these on -- \nRACHEL \nJER-- \nJERRY Do it! \nCONTINUED: They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2.. \nWHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS \nCOLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS. The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them. Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them -- Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door -- \nCHAUFFEUR Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game. \nJERRY Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry -- \nCHAUFFEUR I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: \"JUST MARRIED.\" \nEXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY \nLatesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each as tall and broad as the next -- \nLATESHA (looking UP at them all) Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders. \nLATESHA (CONT'D) Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID: \nLATESHA (CONT'D) Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance.

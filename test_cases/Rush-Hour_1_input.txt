WALTHER Carson? (Carson nods) Walther. Who told the Ambassador? 
CARSON His Security Chief. (beat) There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street. We're trying to reach the parents. 
WALTHER Goddamn it... (sotto) Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean Premier's niece! We're hearing rumors they're gonna make a major issue out of what happened here... 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer. 
Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins, Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door. 
CARSON I'm not so sure what happened here. Something smells. Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him... 
WALTHER What the hell are you talking about? 
AMBASSADOR HAN (OS) Mr. Walther? 
Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with repressed emotion. 
WALTHER Ambassador Han... my deepest -- 
AMBASSADOR HAN -- I have no wish for condolences. Just answers. 
WALTHER As soon as we have any to give... 
Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands. 
Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp breath and sits on the steps. 
AMBASSADOR HAN (into phone) Yoon..?! 
CARSON (to FBI agents) Start a trace! 
Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key. 
WALTHER (into phone) Mr. Secretary... they're alive! 
COLONEL LEE (to Carson; incensed) You are tapping our phones?! 
CARSON (while crossing to Ambassador Han) Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl Streep. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face. 
MRS. HAN (into phone) We are not hurt. But this man is very serious -- 
He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself. 
JAVAL (into phone) I want you to remember the feeling you had when you thought your family was dead, and use it to inform the choices you're about to make. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY 
CARSON Say you want to talk to the kids... 
AMBASSADOR HAN (into phone) I need to know my children are all right. 
JAVAL (VO) (thru phone) Be in front of a television in two minutes. Tune it to channel four. You'll get the picture. 
Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up. 
AMBASSADOR HAN There is a television in my office. 
As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles: 
ROBBINS (VO) (thru radio) We're screwed on the trace -- he's on a cell phone. 
INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console. 
DAVE Play the tape back. I might be able to pull the electronic serial number out of the subcarrier. 
CARSON (VO) (thru radio) Ask Dave if he knows how to find the phone's serial number. 
ROBBINS (smiles; into radio) Hey, great idea... 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4. 
ANGLE ON TV 
It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture. 
CLOSER 
There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND." 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

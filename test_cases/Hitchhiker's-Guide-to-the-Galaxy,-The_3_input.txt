Zaphod looks up.    Deep Thought is shushing him? 
DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D) The show's back on. 
A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume. 
Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed. 
ZAPHOD Great. This is just great. Let's go find something else for my entire life to be about. 
He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm. 
FORD Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We have to get it. You gave the guy your head. 
ZAPHOD I know.    Why did I do that? 
He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns... 
FORD Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have a g... 
Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A robotic arm pushes it forward. 
Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away, 
CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT 
Ford hands Zaphod the gun. 
FORD (CONT'D) Here.     Take it. I don't do guns. 
Zaphod takes it with a smile... 
ZAPHOD Thank you. 
...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has happened. 
ZAPHOD (CONT'D) Great!    This is a bust, too! (CONTINUED)

FORD Hey, man, you must be really frustrated. To go through all you did only to come here and get no answer, which means no fame and money, and you deserve that, man. Because you're great -- you're just really, really great. 
Zaphod isn't sure what just happened. But he smiles anyway. Trillian, however, is onto something. 
TRILLIAN Give me that thing. BACK TO: 
98      INT. MAGRATHEA. PLANET FACTORY. CONSTRUCTION PLATFORM       98 
The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and clouds obscure our view. 
SLARTIBARTFAST The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the boring jobs. 
ARTHUR Oh, you had that problem, too? 
SLARTIBARTFAST In spades. So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face. 
ARTHUR What? You did that? I've been there! 
The cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet. 
SLARTIBARTFAST Then I gather you've met some of the inhabitants. 
ARTHUR The Vogons? 
SLARTIBARTFAST (shuddering) Relentless blighters.

TWO MISSILES screech overhead and soar up toward... 
THE VOGON SHIPS -- descending from space. The missiles each hit a ship. They explode. Two more missiles fire, taking out two more ships. But several ships do land. Marvin watches from within the Stonehenge formation.

CLOSE ON ZAPHOD 
ZAPHOD ...and you're right, I shouldn't be so upset 'cause life goes on and I should just go on with it, right? 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- Ford is hesitantly aiming the gun at Zaphod. 
TRILLIAN Shoot him again. 
Ford reluctantly pulls the trigger.    CLICK. 
ZAPHOD Hitchhiking is good.    Towels are good, too.

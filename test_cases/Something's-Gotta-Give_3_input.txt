Yeah and totally changing their tastes. Like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like...ever...and I'm talking really liking it. It's...unnerving. 
JULIAN 
I think you can expect just about anything right now. People have done some wild things after having a heart attack...selling businesses, getting divorced, moving... Some people say it saved their lives. 
HARRY 
But most people go back to being themselves, right? I'll go back to being me, won't I?

ULIAN 
We'll see. 
ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS 
She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life. She picks up the phone. 
HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN. 
HARRY 
(on his cell) Hi. 
ERICA 
Hey.    What'd he say? 
HARRY 
He said you're wonderful. 
ERICA 
No, really, what'd he say...How are you? 
HARRY 
He said I'm good..that I can go. 
. ERICA 
(obviously conflicted) Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really. . . great. 
HARRY 
Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute sure. You think you can deal with me for one more night? 
A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT 
Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest people in the room, dancing with each other. 
A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM 
Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the crowd enthusiastically applauds. 
HARRY 
(big breath) Okay, here goes... 
ERICA 
Here goes what? 
HARRY 
Here goes me singing to you... (pulling a DISC out of his pocket) Bought my own music. 
ERICA 
You knew they had karaoke? 
HARRY 
Baby, it's why we're here. . Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica. 
HARRY 
This is for you, Ace... (then, under his breath) wish me luck. The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love". 
HARRY 
(sings) I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To Give your heart a song to sing... And then a kiss, but more than this... I wish H         you love... arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses. 
HARRY 
Don't want to blow this part... Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . . 
HARRY 
(sings) Et en juillet une limonade...Pour vous refroidir dans quelque lefy glade... And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues singing, we: 
CUT TO: 
LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY 
Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house. 
INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME 
Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong. 
ERICA 
(holding some cigars) Here you go, you can have these back now. (Harry looks confused) I confiscated them your first night here... 
HARRY 
(smells them) Thank you darlin' ... 
ERICA 
Try not to smoke them... (hands him a small bag) And I packed you a sandwich, just in case your blood sugar got low. And some of that iced-tea you like, and a nonfat, low cholesterol cookie. And a peach. 
HARRY 
what a doll... (notices) Got something else? From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center. 
ERICA 
Something to remember me by. Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her. 
HARRY 
There is that... 
ERICA 
And hey, we'll always have Paris. 
HARRY 
Honey, no words can ever express my gratitude for taking me in and taking care of me and... 
ERICA

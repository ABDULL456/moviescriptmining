HILDY And up a dime. 
ENDICOTT (studying a second) I call. What you got? 
HILDY (displaying her cards) Three bullets! Any good? 
ENDICOTT (throwing his cards away) Beats king up. 
Hildy rakes in the money. 
MCCUE What are you going to do with all that money, Hildy? 
WILSON Yeah -- you can't spend it in Albany. 
HILDY Oh, I'll think of something. 
MED. SHOT 
taking in door and including group. Bensinger, another reporter, comes in from the corridor. He stands out from the others because of his tidy appearance, and carries a book under his arm. 
MURPHY Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging? 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
BENSINGER (cockily) Why don't you fellows get your own news? 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
HILDY Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow? 
TWO SHOT FEATURING HILDY AND BENSINGER 
BENSINGER Hildy! 
He comes over to shake hands. 
BENSINGER Are you back? 
HILDY No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself. 
BENSINGER What doing? 
HILDY I'm getting married tomorrow. 
BENSINGER Well, congratulations! Good luck! 
THE TABLE ANOTHER ANGLE 
ENDICOTT Why don't you use him for a bridesmaid, Hildy? 
SCHWARTZ Come on, Hildy, your deal. 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER AT HIS DESK 
He opens a drawer, the one in which Hildy put her stockings. 
BENSINGER Say, who put these stockings in my desk? (he turns to the group) 
McCUE's VOICE I don't know, but I think they got rats in the building. 
BENSINGER (makes a gesture of disgust and picks up telephone) This is Bensinger. I just saw the Sheriff. He won't move the hanging up a minute... All right, I'll talk to him again, but it's no use. The execution is set for seven in the morning. Get me a rewrite man. 
CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT 
dealing the cards. 
ENDICOTT Why can't they hang that guy at a reasonable hour, so we can get some sleep? 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
BENSINGER (into phone) Jake, new lead on the hanging. This new alienist from New York -- Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer -- is going to interview Williams in about half an hour -- in the Sheriff's office. 
MED. SHOT AT TABLE - FEATURING MURPHY 
Murphy reaches for the phone. Without dropping his cards, he jiggles the hook. 
MURPHY That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him. (into phone) Gimme the desk. 
ENDICOTT This Egelhoffer's pretty good. 
MURPHY Yeah? What did he ever do for his country? 
ENDICOTT Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation! 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
He is referring to his notes as he talks: 
BENSINGER (into phone) Here's the situation on the eve of the hanging: 
CLOSE SHOT MURPHY 
He continues playing his cards: 
MURPHY (into phone) This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging. 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
BENSINGER (into phone) A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution. 
CLOSE SHOT MURPHY 
MURPHY (into phone) Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes. (consults his hand) Up a dime. 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
BENSINGER (into phone) The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty. 
CLOSE SHOT MURPHY 
MURPHY (into phone) And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings. 
MED. SHOT AT TABLE FEATURING HILDY 
ENDICOTT Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!' 
MURPHY What have you got, Hildy? 
HILDY Kings and sixes. 
MURPHY (throwing down) That's good. 
HILDY (sweeping coins in) 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee. 
WILSON That's why I keep losing. My grandma was a modest woman -- nobody ever saw her knees, not even my grandpop.

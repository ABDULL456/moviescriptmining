MASLOW No idea- 
He finishes his soda and takes his garbage to the can. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) But I can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're the most attractive researcher that I've ever worked with. 
He smiles and turns before she flushes a bright shade of red. 
16   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                       16 
A teapot begins to sing. 
Raizo pours the boiling water into a plastic bowl of noodles. He covers the bowl and waits a moment for the soup to cook. 
As he stares, we hear. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   17. 16   CONTINUED:                                                   16 
OZUNU (V.O.) The body must obey the will.                         * 
17   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DAY         17 
Several of the younger members of the clan are sitting at the table, about to eat. 
Ozunu stands before them. He removes a small blade from inside his robe. Places the blade against his palm. 
OZUNU Hunger and thirst, your bowels and                   * breath, even the blood in your                       * veins, are the body's weaknesses.                    * 
The knife slices down along his palm, opening a split; the flesh parts, yet no blood flows. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) Master them, and you master the self. 
He closes his fist. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) This is the power of the Ozunu clan. 
He concentrates, squeezing his hand tightly until he opens it revealing that the wound has closed. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) This is the way of the ninja. 
The children look at each other, except for Raizo who stares at Ozunu. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) Eat tonight and you work twice as                    * hard tomorrow. 
Ozunu leaves. 
The children look at the soup, their mouths watering. All around, the older Ozunu clan members eat noisily. One of the children can't resist any longer and begins scooping up the noodles. In short order, others do the same.

All except for Raizo, who sets down his chopsticks. Willing himself not to be hungry. 
17A   BACK TO SCENE                                              17A 
The grown Raizo looks at his soup.    We cannot tell if he is going to eat or not. 
OZUNU The world feeds on the weak. 
18    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE        18 FLOOR - NIGHT 
Young Raizo stands in the central chamber of the compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not, however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong move will make them shift noisily. 
This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor. 
OZUNU Suffering exists only because                       * weakness exists. 
Ozunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any dancer. 
He makes no sound. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) You must hate all weakness. Hate                    * it in others, but most of hate it                   * in yourself. 
He takes another step, and another.    Each soft as a falling feather. 
He is a third of the way across the floor - his body gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor sings beneath him. 
Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches. 
Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing blows that leave deep cuts.

Raizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise, and leaving no trace of his passage... 
...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints.

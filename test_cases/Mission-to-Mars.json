{"test1_input": "\"MISSION TO MARS\" \nScreenplay by \nJim Thomas, John Thomas & Graham Yost \nStory by \nLowell Cannon, Jim Thomas & John Thomas \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY \nBlue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day. \nSUPER TITLE: \"HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020.\" \nAs we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE. \nPHIL T minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition... Liftoff! \nA tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, excited SHOUTS. \nEXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON \nDESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube. \nCHILDREN (all at once) My turn! My turn! No, I was next! No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can I do one? I want to do one! \nPHIL Guys, guys, please! This is risky stuff here. And I'm a highly trained professional. \nDerisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for silence. \nPHIL Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch another booster... \nAnother astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and Phil catches it. \nPHIL ...just as soon as he completes his fuel intake. \nANGLE FOLLOWS COTE \nWho grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed about. A banner, strung between trees, reads \"BON VOYAGE, MARS ONE!!!\" \nWILLIS It'll take us six months just to get to Mars. Another year on the surface, then six months back. That's two years... \nPassing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well. \nWILLIS I guess what I'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on Earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. Y'know? \nPRETTY GIRL Nice try, Nick. \nAs the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his beer, swigs it. \nANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open- pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily at the chef. \nKIROV Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty good long rendezvous. \nWOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a Hawaiian shirt and a \"KISS THE CHEF\" apron. An entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting this as he smiles at Malik. \nWOODY What are you suggesting, Sergei? \nKIROV Maybe you should bring a baseball bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series. \nWOODY Please. Half you guys are foreigners. We'd crush you. \nKIROV No, no, we have equal crews. Three men, one woman. Same handicap. \nHe grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him. \nWOODY Easy now, you're talking about my wife. (seeing her approach) And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop. \nDR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. Then she glances at Kirov, all business now. \nTERRI Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. Thousand bucks make it interesting? \nHe's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement. \nCOTE Eh bien. Winner take all. \nTERRI Good. (smiles sweetly at Kirov) Bring some balls. \nThe other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt grin. \nWOODY You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of \"Yes, dears.\" \nThe others laugh. \nANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad. \n1ST WIFE ...just not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples to go on this type of mission together. \nOne of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter. \n1ST WIFE (embarrassed) Nothing personal, Terri. It's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind. \nTERRI (carefully neutral) All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips. \n", "test1_true": "Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really have much in common with these women -- before moving on. ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around. \n3RD WIFE Anybody seen Jim McConnell? \n4TH WIFE I don't think he's coming. \n1ST WIFE God, that poor man. How's he doing? \n2ND WIFE Totally losing it, from what I hear. Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her grave almost every day. (lowers her voice) They say he could lose mission status. \n3RD WIFE Oh, that's so sad. That is just so tragic. You go to a routine physical one day, and wham. \n4TH WIFE After all those years of training, too. It was their whole dream. \n1ST WIFE Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna be in the history books. First man on Mars... \nShe shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in agreement, following her glance... \nIn the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him. \nCLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her with an apologetic smile. \nDEBRA He's not coming, Luke. \nLUKE Jim deserves this, too. All his friends are here. And it's my last night. \nDEBRA (gently) Your last night with us, too. \nHe looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his arms around her waist, kisses her forehead. \nLUKE I love you, Deb. \nDEBRA I love you too, baby. But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby. \nLUKE Yeah. I will. Where is he? \nDEBRA Up in his fort. \nHe kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, with a mixture of pride and sadness. \nANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into \nEXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON \nLuke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead. \nIn the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to PRETTY GIRL #2. \nWILLIS Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. But I guess I'll have my memories to keep me warm... \nLuke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder. \nA SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby on a tripod. He looks lonely. \nLuke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky. \nBOBBY Who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime? \nLuke is surprised by the question. A pause. \nLUKE Mommy will. \nBOBBY I like when you do it. Now we're never gonna finish our book. \nHis voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. Luke is moved. Another brief silence. \nLUKE Well, I'll tell you what. I've been thinking about that. And what I thought was -- how 'bout if I bring along my own copy? (Bobby looks at him) Then every night, wherever I am, I'll read a little bit more of it. And I'll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. That way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'Cause I don't know about you, but I'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island. What d'you say? \nBobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. Luke is proud of his son's courage. \nLUKE Good deal. Can I have a hug? \nBobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. They both turn. \nAn open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone. \nLuke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness. \nEXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON \nThe Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards the party, then pauses again. \nDebra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She smiles tentatively. \nJIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in. \nYet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural leader. \nDebra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining. \nDEBRA We were afraid you wouldn't come. \nMCCONNELL I caught a whiff of your barbecue. After that I was helpless. \nDEBRA All the way out in Galveston? \nMCCONNELL Something like that. (she smiles) It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it. \nDEBRA Spoil it? He's been going crazy looking for you. \n", "test1_id": 1926, "test2_input": "TERRI Jim, I don't -- \nMCCONNELL Shake it out near the hull! \nTerri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the \"ceiling\" of the outer hull, like a miniature tornado. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody still drifts over the hull, searching intently as his frustration builds. \nWOODY C'mon, c'mon, where are you...? \nCOMPUTER (V.O.) Fifty per cent atmosphere... \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nTerri, staring at the ceiling, sees something remarkable. \nTHE SODA STREAM \nSwirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She can now see the ugly puncture for the first time. \nMCCONNELL (gasping) Woody, the breech is in sector four! Sector four, copy that? \nWOODY (V.O.) Copy, I' heading there now. \nTerri turns, excited by McConnell's triumph; she's just in time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale. \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away from him, but clearly visible. \nWOODY (to himself, marveling) Sonofabitch. You never did that in the simulator. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nTerri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in air, color returning to his skin as he revives. \nINT. COCKPIT. NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S GUTS. \nAn incredible tangle of tubes, wires, chips, as Phil's gloved fingers -- both hands now -- probe desperately through them. \nPHIL Where are you, you little bastard, where are you...? \nPHIL WINCES WITH PAIN. \nAs he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart, streaking into electronic snow. He shoots a tense glance at \nTHE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR \nWhich is flickering crazily. It shows the ship moving much closer to its critical MOI point, indicated by a flashing red triangle aimed down at the Martian surface. \nCOMPUTER Forty percent atmosphere... \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody, popping his thrusters, moves as fast as he can towards the protruding finger of crystal, but he's not there yet. \nAll of a sudden Woody's thrusters cut out. The ship is moving by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls. Nothing. \nThen just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him, the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to move to the hole. Woody lets out a breath. \nWOODY (to himself) Whoa. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nMcConnell, holding his breath, grabs a patch gun from a storage locker. Terri's still got the 0-2 cannister. He nods to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the \"ceiling.\" They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been only partially dammed by the soda ice. \nINT. COCKPIT. NIGHT \nVERY CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S INTERIOR \nAs Phil's gloved fingers finally locate the plug he's been searching for. He hopes. And grip it firmly. \nPHIL Gotcha! \nPHIL TAKES A DEEP BREATH. \nSays a silent prayer. Then he yanks the plug. SHRILL WHINES, ELECTRONIC CRACKLES from all around him, as the systems are abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be mishandled. Terrifyingly, a couple of the monitors arc to each other as they die. Dodging sparks, Phil stares at \nTHE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR \nAs it also flickers and dies. Now they're flying blind. \nCOMPUTER Thirty percent atmosphere... \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody arrives at the ice finger, knocks away the big crystal, then pulls his patch equipment from a pouch. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nIn the Hab, Terri uses the base of the 0-2 cannister to smash away the interior ice chunk, then McConnell, who's getting wobbly again, blasts the hole with the epoxy gun. As he works, Terri gives him another hit of air. \n", "test2_true": "The lights flicker out in the Hab. \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nOutside, Woody slaps a big square patch over the hole, rips off the backing. \nCLOSE ON THE PATCH \nAs it changes color and shrinks, drawing itself down into the metal of the hull. \nINT. COCKPIT. NIGHT \nVERY CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S INTERIOR. \nAs Phil's fingers re-connect the same plug. \nPHIL PULLS HIS HAND OUT \nFrom inside the computer bay. He's trembling, sweat-streaked inside his faceplate. Blood has soaked through his gauze pads. His good hand hovers over the red main power switch. The moment of truth. \nPHIL OK... OK now... \nWith a dramatic click, he throws the switch, hard-booting the computer system back on. He stares at the screens. \nNothing happens! \nPHIL Come on. Come on...! \nFrightened, furious, Phil bangs on the switch with his cordless screwdriver. When all else fails, hit something. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nFeeble starlight from the viewports. McConnell and Terri, drifting side by side, stare at one another, expecting to die within seconds. It feels like an agonizing eternity. \nCOMPUTER Twenty percent atmosphere... \nMcConnell's eyes widen, as he realizes this is the same as the last reading. \nCOMPUTER Pressure stabilizing... Atmosphere level increasing. \nTerri and McConnell look at each other. Tears of relief in her eyes. He is exhausted, nearly spent, but manages a grin. She holds the 0-2 mask up to his face, and as he grips it, breathing deeply, they hug one another. \nINT. COCKPIT. NIGHT \nThe lights and computer screens are flickering back on. All of them! The cockpit lights up like a Christmas tree. Phil bounces up and down like a madman, babbling in triumph. \nPHIL Yes! Awriiiight! Had it all the way. Yes! \nForgetting his injury, he pounds his gloved fist on the console in triumph. \nPHIL Shit! \nHe wrings his injured hand, then his gaze is caught by \nTHE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR \nWhich pops back on, showing the ship and the MOI point coming perilously close together. \nPHIL'S EYES WIDEN IN FEAR \nAs he keys his mike urgently. \nPHIL Get back in here, guys! \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody floats above the repaired hole, scanning the nearby surface of the hull. \nWOODY Jim, there's a lot of scarring... I'd better check for other punctures while I'm out here. \nMCCONNELL (V.O.) Negative, negative. Woody, get back inside. We've gotta start the checklist for orbital insertion. \nWOODY (a beat; reluctantly) Copy, I'm heading there now. \nWoody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he reaches this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him. \nSUNRISE OVER MARS \nAs the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly glory. It's so close now that individual features can be seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris, and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle. \nWOODY \nStares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath. \nWOODY Hey, Beautiful... \nThen he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through the EVA hatch. \nCAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There's a good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower. Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME... \nWE MOVE IN CLOSER \nOn one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of the eraser at the end of a pencil. So small, so apparently harmless... \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY \n", "test2_id": 1927, "test3_input": "EXT. ERV. DAY \nPerched atop the ERV's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover. He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand. \nPHIL I've got ERV access. I'm going in. Terri, you okay? \nEXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY \nTerri is still scooping sand. She's just cleared the first row of gauges. \nTERRI Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to get back to 100% capacity. \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY \nMcConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew taped their final, fateful message. \nHIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE \nStill sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins, startled, and sees \nHIS OWN REFLECTION. \nIn his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets. \nMCCONNELL SHIVERS \nThis place is filled with ghosts. \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY \nPhil, in the pilot's seat of the ERV, pushes a computer's power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy static. \nPHIL ERV appears structurally intact. Computers are fried, just as we thought. \nEXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY \nTerri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her heels, studying the tangle of pipes. \nTERRI Copy that. I've got busted filters here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup job, but so far no major damage. \nINT. GREENHOUSE. DAY \nAN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS. THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV \nOn a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever assortment of collection jars. Liquid water. \nMCCONNELL \nReaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, he looks down at his forearm instrument pad. \nBlinking red letters read \"25 deg. C.\" And something else -- the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in here! \nMCCONNELL \nPunches in more numbers, and gets the readout: \n\"Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%.\" \nMCCONNELL \nSlowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards his helmet. \nMCCONNELL I'm in the greenhouse. You better... you better come see this for yourselves. \nINT. ERV. DAY \nPhil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse. \nPHIL What is it? \nThere's no answer. He rises. \nEXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY \nTerri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant, translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure can be seen, moving slowly. \nTERRI Jim...? \nINT. GREENHOUSE. DAY \nMcConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has come into play. He pauses, looking up... \nOverhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with duct tape, like some giant Erector set. \nAs McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground. \nMcConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a glimpse of the almost unrecognizable \nLUKE GRAHAM \nWhose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off. \nMCCONNELL Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell! \nWe see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles in the air. \nLUKE You're not here! \nMCCONNELL Luke, it's Jim! \n", "test3_true": "MCCONNELL Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby! You were reading Treasure Island with him...! \nAs he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell scrambles to his feet. \nMCCONNELL Don't hurt him! \nMcConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath. \nLuke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after another, as if still not quite certain whether they might vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse. \nLUKE Phil... Terri... \nLuke looks with incomprehension at McConnell. \nLUKE Jim... I don't understand. You're not supposed to be here... Why are you here? Where's Woody? \nMCCONNELL He didn't make it Luke. \nLuke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He looks to Terri, who looks down. \nLUKE Oh no. \nLuke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. ELSEWHERE IN THE GREENHOUSE. DAY (MINUTES LATER) \nLuke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse. Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested vegetables and greens. The others crouch around him. \nMCCONNELL Luke, what happened here? \nA flash of fear in Luke's eyes. \nLUKE (whispers) We fired the radar. It came. They all died. \nMCCONNELL What came? \nLUKE They all died, but I was spared. Why? Had to be for a reason. Then, all of a sudden, I knew why I was spared. \nHis voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper. \nLUKE So somebody would be left to figure out the secret. \nHe taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice. The others exchange an uneasy glance. \nMCCONNELL Luke, we still don't understand. \nLUKE Come. Comecomecome. \nHe rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand, without waiting to see if they'll follow. McConnell, Terri and Phil stare after him for a long moment. Phil breaks the silence. \nPHIL Is it just me? Or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic? \nTERRI Long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain. He could be suffering from a form of asphyxia. \nMCCONNELL Or maybe his whole crew died and he's been marooned alone on Mars. Let's give him time to adjust. \nMcConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Phil, trailing, mutters to himself. \nPHIL Greatgreatgreat. \nEXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY \nLuke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear Luke over his RADIO. \nLUKE So... let me be sure I understand this. Your ship blew up, with all its supplies. Then you emptied the cargo out of the REMO, and it was totalled on landing. You've got no food, no water, no spare oxygen, nothing but what I see here...? \nMcConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin. \nLUKE What kinda rescue mission is this? \nMCCONNELL That kind. \nHe points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil. \nPHIL Check it out. New nav boards for the ERV. I got four round-trip tickets, baby, right in here. \nLUKE (softly) Four. \nIn some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death seems to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by the shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze. \nLUKE Terri... I'm so sorry. He was a good man. \nTERRI Thanks, Luke. \nLUKE When there's time, we'll talk. \nShe nods, grateful. A beat. He looks at the others. \nLUKE This way. \nHe starts off across the sand, and they follow. \nEXT. GRAVE SITE. DAY \nThey stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as Luke completes his account of the disaster. \n", "test3_id": 1928}

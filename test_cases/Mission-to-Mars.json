{"train": "Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles. \nLUKE C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you. \nMcConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER) \nAll the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood. \nEXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT \nThe yard is nearly deserted. The \"Bon Voyage\" banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a napkin blows across the ground. \nIn the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers. \nCLOSER ON THIS TRIO \nAs Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones. \nWOODY (abruptly) I wish we were all going. Together. \nThe intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat. \nLUKE Then you've got a short memory. Think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training. \nWOODY Oh, you're not gonna bring that up again -- \nLUKE (laughing) I'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there? \nWOODY You just can't let that go -- \nLUKE Oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship? If they sent us off to Mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos. \nWOODY (laughs) Bullshit, we would've made a great crew. \nMCCONNELL That was never gonna happen. I was always teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. You know? Systems. Payloads... \nLUKE Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time Magazine! \nWOODY Yeah, who landed the crippled Block II Shuttle? \nLUKE Yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings? \nWOODY Let it go, Luke. \nMCCONNELL (smiles) Sure, I made a little noise. But putting the first footprints on Mars? Nah. That's for guys who... (looks at Luke) ...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place. And guys who... (looks at Woody) ...read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks. \nHe grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand away, laughing. \nWOODY You read the same damn science fiction books that I did! You're just not man enough to wear jewelry! \nHe pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh. \nWOODY You want Flash. You know you want him. Well you'll have to come through me! \nLuke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head. \nMCCONNELL God, she would've loved to see you two clowns. Just one more time. \nHe tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, walking away a few steps. \nWoody and Luke exchange a worried glance. \nEXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT \nMcConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. McConnell has regained his composure. \nLUKE Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time you donated this thing to a museum? \nWoody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins. \nWOODY Internal combustion, boys. Accept no substitutes. \nLuke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell. \nWOODY Jim, if there's ever... if there's anything Terri and I can do -- \nMCCONNELL I'm okay. Really. Thanks. \nWoody reaches out to shake Luke's hand. \nWOODY See you when I get to Mars, Luke. Don't solve all the mysteries of the universe, okay? Leave a little something for the next guys. \nLUKE I'll see what I can do. Just make sure you bring some fresh beer. \nWOODY You got it. \nWith a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this. \nLUKE Should've been your mission, Jim. Yours and Maggie's. \nMcConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still. \nLUKE None of us ever wanted Mars the way you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve years of hoping for this assignment, training for it -- \nMCCONNELL That's all over now. \nThey all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is incredulous, exasperated. \nCOTE Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, he picked today's sector. \nKIROV Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific duty to check that thing out. \nLuke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution. \nLUKE Great. That's great. The first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make NASA look ridiculous... You know how many books have been written about that damned mountain? \nCOTE The Egyptians put it there. \nKIROV No, the Amazons. \nWILLIS No, it was little green men! \nLUKE And all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll have every UFO kook on Earth spouting off on the six o'clock news... C'mon, people, gimme a read here. Is that a cinder cone? \nKIROV Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic upwelling? \nCOTE No fissures. No caldera. \nLUKE It's an upwelling, for sure. But maybe not volcanic... \nThe others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with growing excitement. He points to the screen. \nLUKE Look at the color. And see how shiny it is? I could swear that's ice... \nCOTE This far south? \nWILLIS Impossible. You can't have ice at this latitude. Not unless... \nThey look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from one to another of them. They're almost trembling. \nWILLIS Oh my God. \nLUKE How far away is it? \nKIROV Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take us twenty minutes to get there. \nLUKE (considers a moment) Let's send a packet to Micker. Then we'll go check it out. \nEXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY \nAIRLOCK DOORS \nSlide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear. They walk over to... \nTHE FOUR-MAN ROVER \nThe astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke puts the rover in drive. \nWIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY \nAs the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL, PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which arrived as a separate, unmanned flight. \nRows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY \nA vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA and U.N. flag decals. \nSUPER TITLE: \"INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG.\" \nWe MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers. \nLUKE This is a truly anomalous formation. Looks like nothing we've seen so far. The structure appears to be crystalline, at least from the angle displayed by ARES-8 ... \nINT. MMCR. DAY \nOn a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE. \nLUKE (grins) We're all trying not to go too nuts up here, but -- we think there's a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface, geothermal column of water. And if we're right... \nHe looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries. \nLUKE ...then we've found the key to permanent human colonization. \nIN THE MMCR \nThere's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic, epochal discovery. \nMCCONNELL \nSits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for instructions. \nMCCONNELL Tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this. Full-court press. \nThe technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the intense excitement of those around him, stares up at \nTHE SCREEN \nWhere Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create. \nLUKE Anyway, we'are going out to take a closer look at it, try to get an idea of its composition. (checks his watch) By the time you receive this, we should be just about on-site. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nWE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously still with all four wheels... \nWE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE, its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we come to the area where the fissure had been, and see \nTHE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN \nLeaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke. The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see \nEXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY \nAn extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face. \nThe surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, slopes, ramps. The \"eyes\" -- hatches of some kind? -- are closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask. \nWe see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble continues, low and insistent... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MARS TWO (DOCKED). COCKPIT. DAY \nWe're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its docked position alongside the Space Station. \nWoody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual. \nWOODY (reads) \"Problem: Hatch door malfunction, backup power fail, manual override fail. Solution: Replace circuit breaker 907B.\" \nHe straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical junction box at one end of the console. \nWOODY Okay... Piece of cake. \nHe swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's seat. \nWOODY God, who dreams up these nightmares? \nTERRI Don't try to change the subject. \nWOODY I'm not! We're talking about your sister's wedding, right? \nTERRI Very funny. We're talking about dancing lessons. Before my sister's wedding. \nWOODY Honey, do you mind? I've got a catastrophic power failure here. \nHe peers into the housing with exaggerated concern. But Terri's not so easily sidetracked. \nTERRI Woody, we're a married couple. Would it kill you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile? \nWOODY I danced with you at our wedding. \nTERRI I'm not talking about shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt. I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug -- \nWOODY Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go to Mars. That's life. \nTERRI I'm serious. We've got two more months in this training rotation, but just as soon as we get home, we're starting lessons. If we never dance, people will think there's something wrong. \nWOODY If they see me dance, they'll know there's something wrong. \nReaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker. As he reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation. \nTERRI You are such a lug. \nOverhead, an intercom CRACKLES. We hear PHIL. \nPHIL'S VOICE Cockpit, this is Control. \nTERRI Control, this is Cockpit. \nPHIL'S VOICE Uh, Terri, they want us all back in the Station. Report to Micker. \nTERRI Who says report to Micker? \nPHIL'S VOICE The little men who live in my head. \nWOODY Phil, c'mon! We just started this drill. \nPHIL Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me to round up the team. Now. \nWoody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong? \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY \nA crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded than we've ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering feverishly into microphones. \nOn the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red. \nWOODY AND HIS CREW \nAre staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck stand nearby, briefing them. \nBECK Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous data stream from Mars went silent. All data -- med, environmental, everything -- suddenly stopped. While we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong, we got a signal from the folks at the Large Array at Soccoro. \nMCCONNELL At the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars. \nWOODY What do you mean, \"intense\"? \nMCCONNELL (hesitates) Catastrophic. \nPHIL What about SIMA? \nTerri looks at Phil -- SIMA? \nPHIL The Saturn Imaging Probe. It's going to slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system. It could be retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels at Mars One Base Camp. \nWOODY Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us Luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right back home. \nMCCONNELL Yes. We can design the mission to have a free return capability. It's a long trip, but if you don't land it's the best option. \nBECK We're getting ahead of ourselves. You're forgetting the bigger problem. (they look at him) The orbits are all wrong. Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now. \nMCCONNELL But we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel. We've modelled that, Ray. I've modelled it. \nBECK On paper, yeah. But those stresses have never been tested in space. \nMCCONNELL The ship can take it. \nBECK I wasn't thinking of just the ship. \nA tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these two tough-minded men, once good friends. \nMCCONNELL I know the protocols for a Mars Recovery Mission better than anybody, because I helped design them. And I'm saying these guys can do it. \nWOODY He's right, Ray. We've got a real shot. \nA pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody. \nBECK Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow. Then I'll put it in the works. \nMCCONNELL You'll have it by 0600. \nHe looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager. \nMCCONNELL Let's get to work. \nMcConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts out, too, Woody stops him. \nWOODY Chief, could I have a word? \nBeck looks at him a moment, nods. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY \nIn a quiet corner, Woody and Beck are alone. \nWOODY I've no longer got the right crew. \nBECK (surprised) What do you mean? Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle. \nWOODY Bjornstrom is a geologist. He's good, but not for this. My people just lost eight months of training. This is a different mission, with a different objective. \nBECK I haven't been given authorization for a mission yet. \nWOODY But when you are, it ought to be given the best chance for success. I want McConnell to fly right seat. \nBeck's expression hardens. \nBECK He's no longer on mission status. \nWOODY Yeah. Because you washed him out. \nBECK He washed himself out. He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations, but he refused to take them. \nWOODY Ray, he's the best pilot I ever saw, and you've got him benched at a desk. \nBECK Everybody has to pass the psych prelims. No exceptions. Jim knew that. \nWOODY Maggie was his wife. He didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers. \nBECK That was his call. But I had to make one too. It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again. \nWOODY His wife wasted away in front of his eyes. What was he supposed to do? Suck it up? Get with the program? What was his crime? That he was upset? That he cried...? \nBECK I couldn't trust him! \nBeck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat. \nBECK (his voice softer) Not in a crisis... I'm sorry Woody, but Jim lost his edge. Are you gonna stand there and tell me Jim McConnell is the same man he was two years ago? You want me to bet four more lives on that? \nThis stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on harder, with even greater intensity. \nWOODY When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him. It knocked the hell out of all of us. But you know and I know that he's still the best we've got. He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars. He's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together. Ray, we can do this. Give me McConnell as co-pilot, and we will bring Luke home. And that's a promise. \nBeck looks back at him, his features taunt. \nINT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY \nWoody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as \nIN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV \nBeck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's console. Other personnel have moved away, giving them room. Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly. After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search the room till they find \nWOODY'S FACE \nWOODY We'll have to be ready to move fast. Maybe even advance our ETA. Those things can cover the whole planet, and last up to a year. \nA beat. They both hope he's wrong. \nMCCONNELL When does SIMA do her fly-by? \nWOODY Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing. \nThey exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars. \nMCCONNELL (softly) My money's on Luke. \nINT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING \nCLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK \nJust turning over to read \"0545.\" \nTERRI \nPulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby is her electron microscope. \nMCCONNELL (LOWER HAB) \nLies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed. The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau. \nPHOTO OF A WOMAN \nRests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling, dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with intelligence and energy. \nMCCONNELL \nShifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads \"0546.\" \nPHIL (LOWER HAB) \nStands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances at another digital clock, which reads \"0547.\" Shakes his head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's \"Blue Moon.\" \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY \nPhil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of \nWOODY AND TERRI DANCING \nLike a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious. \nHe sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head. \nPHIL What brought this on? \nWOODY Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. Once we're in Mars gravity, it's back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt. \nTERRI I'll take what I can get. \nShe grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees \nMCCONNELL \nWho has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: Aren't they something? \nOver the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, then an announcement. \nCOMPUTER Attention. Incoming packet. \nThey all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to a console, shuts off the music. \nMCCONNELL It's SIMA. \nINT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER \nThe crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we can tell the news is not good. \nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN \nIt's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life. \nWOODY Looks deserted. \nPHIL It's still standing, though. So is the ERV. And look, there's the greenhouse. \nMCCONNELL We know Luke survived for at least a few hours. Question is, are there any signs of recent activity? \nThey all scan the screen. Phil spots something. \nPHIL There. \nHe grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look. CLOSE ON THE SCREEN \nUsing where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some fifty meters from the hab. \nPHIL What the hell are those? \nMcConnell gets it first. \nMCCONNELL Graves. \nAn impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand, everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil, Cote, Kirov, others. They're watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE, shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody. \nTHE FIRST PHOTO \nIs of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling in front of a Christmas tree. He's grinning ecstatically as he holds up a brand new model rocket. \nLUKE Jim's first ship was seriously underpowered... \nLAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad haircut and the pajamas. \nTHE SECOND PHOTO \nIs of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a telescope on its tripod. \nWOODY Maggie was always starstruck... \nMore LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth, leaning into each other, looking very happy. \nMAGGIE I'll get you guys for this. \nMore LAUGHTER. Everyone's having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA swings back towards the TV screen as \nTHIRD PHOTO APPEARS \nJim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand. Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles. \nLUKE When they met at the Air Force Academy, it was \"love at first flight.\" \nGROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers. \nWOODY After that, NASA training was tough. All Jim could think about was exploring a heavenly body. More ribald LAUGHTER, as \nFOURTH PHOTO APPEARS \nMaggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in space suits. \nLUKE But Maggie, as you can see, kept him on a short leash. Until... \nA FIFTH PHOTO \nShows McConnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown. \nWOODY Mission accomplished! \nANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT \nAs he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS, the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not alone. He looks up. \nWOODY \nStands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering. \nIN THE VIDEO \nLuke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves his hands, hushing everybody. \nLUKE Today we celebrate a new chapter in their story. And guys, it's a pretty historic one. \nBoth men raise champagne flutes. \nWOODY Let's hear it for the newly-announced Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. To Jim and Maggie! \nCHEERS at this, repeats of \"Jim and Maggie!\" Luke grins, giving a little signal, and we see \nA FINAL PHOTO \nOf Maggie in Jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image. \nLUKE When you guys land, it'll prove once and for all there's no intelligent life on Mars. \nMore hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri sits nearby. \nMAGGIE Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right? \nASSORTED VOICES Oh no, here we go! Don't get her started! Somebody put on some music! \nMAGGIE It's our sister planet! \nPHIL Oh brother! \nLAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She's a good sport. \nTERRI Maggie, why does this have to be about us? Mars is a great opportunity for pure science. \nMAGGIE We'll do the science. And we'll do it very well. That's what we've trained for. But what if there's more...? In all our myths, in every human culture, Mars has always held a special attraction. What if that means something? Only we don't understand it yet... \nThe mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too. \nMAGGIE The universe is not chaos. It's connection. Life reaches out for life... \nShe looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand. \nMAGGIE This is what we were born for, isn't it? To stand on a new world, and look beyond it to the next one. It's who we are. \nA silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't meant to get so carried away. \nIN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL \nReaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen. He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat. \nANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL \nAs she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding. He's staring at a gauge. \nPHIL Outgassing! Losing pressure! \nTERRI Woody, seal the breech! \nANGLE ON WOODY \nAs he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks this open pulling out a \nPATCH GUN \nThen spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track \nTHE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD \nWhich give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the \"ceiling.\" \nWOODY PUSHES OFF \nRising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a shattered faceplate -- its label reads \"MCCONNELL\" -- to REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here, going into the vacuum of space. \nQuickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS, ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail. \nWOODY Kill those alarms! \nMcConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared. The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon. \nPHIL'S BLOOD DROPLETS \nHave stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core tunnel that leads to the lower Hab. \nMCCONNELL \nStares at a gauge that confirms what's happening. \nMCCONNELL Still outgassing in the lower Hab! There must be another hole down there, even bigger. \nPHIL Losing pressure fast! We're gonna decompress! \nWOODY Computer, how long until zero atmosphere? \nCOMPUTER (after a beat) Four minutes, nine seconds. \nPHIL If we get below 20% atmosphere, the power will shut down! \nTERRI Are you sure? \nPHIL Positive! A vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure. The nav computers will fry! \nMCCONNELL (to Woody) We'll lose all control. We won't be able to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit. \nJust then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punches keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him. \nPHIL It's already starting. The primary L- 1 hub has been smashed. The systems are crashing. \nWoody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more calm than he really feels. \nWOODY Everybody switch to suit oxygen. We beat this in the simulator, we can do it here. Jim, you've got the ship. I'm going EVA. \nThey stare at him, stunned by their immense task. \nWOODY C'mon, people, let's go! Let's work the problem! \nINT. EVA AIRLOCK. MOMENTS LATER \nTerri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but something's in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into his suit, pulls out... \nTHE CHAIN \nFrom around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship dangling. \nWOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI \nAs they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look. \nAt the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful. \nPHIL Jesus, it's still bleeding. \nTERRI Keep the pressure on! \nCOMPUTER Eighty percent atmosphere... \nINT./EXT. AIRLOCK. NIGHT \nThe outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody drifts through it into space. He's now wearing the MMU, an oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle astronauts. \nINT. EVA ROOM. NIGHT \nMCCONNELL'S HELMET. \nWith its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's glove. \nMCCONNELL \nFloats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer. \nTERRI Jim, I don't -- \nMCCONNELL Shake it out near the hull! \nTerri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the \"ceiling\" of the outer hull, like a miniature tornado. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody still drifts over the hull, searching intently as his frustration builds. \nWOODY C'mon, c'mon, where are you...? \nCOMPUTER (V.O.) Fifty per cent atmosphere... \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nTerri, staring at the ceiling, sees something remarkable. \nTHE SODA STREAM \nSwirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She can now see the ugly puncture for the first time. \nMCCONNELL (gasping) Woody, the breech is in sector four! Sector four, copy that? \nWOODY (V.O.) Copy, I' heading there now. \nTerri turns, excited by McConnell's triumph; she's just in time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale. \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away from him, but clearly visible. \nWOODY (to himself, marveling) Sonofabitch. You never did that in the simulator. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nTerri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in air, color returning to his skin as he revives. \nINT. COCKPIT. NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S GUTS. \nAn incredible tangle of tubes, wires, chips, as Phil's gloved fingers -- both hands now -- probe desperately through them. \nPHIL Where are you, you little bastard, where are you...? \nPHIL WINCES WITH PAIN. \nAs he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart, streaking into electronic snow. He shoots a tense glance at \nTHE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR \nWhich is flickering crazily. It shows the ship moving much closer to its critical MOI point, indicated by a flashing red triangle aimed down at the Martian surface. \nCOMPUTER Forty percent atmosphere... \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody, popping his thrusters, moves as fast as he can towards the protruding finger of crystal, but he's not there yet. \nAll of a sudden Woody's thrusters cut out. The ship is moving by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls. Nothing. \nThen just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him, the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to move to the hole. Woody lets out a breath. \nWOODY (to himself) Whoa. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nMcConnell, holding his breath, grabs a patch gun from a storage locker. Terri's still got the 0-2 cannister. He nods to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the \"ceiling.\" They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been only partially dammed by the soda ice. \nINT. COCKPIT. NIGHT \nVERY CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER'S INTERIOR \nAs Phil's gloved fingers finally locate the plug he's been searching for. He hopes. And grip it firmly. \nPHIL Gotcha! \nPHIL TAKES A DEEP BREATH. \nSays a silent prayer. Then he yanks the plug. SHRILL WHINES, ELECTRONIC CRACKLES from all around him, as the systems are abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be mishandled. Terrifyingly, a couple of the monitors arc to each other as they die. Dodging sparks, Phil stares at \nTHE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR \nAs it also flickers and dies. Now they're flying blind. \nCOMPUTER Thirty percent atmosphere... \nEXT. SPACE. NIGHT \nWoody arrives at the ice finger, knocks away the big crystal, then pulls his patch equipment from a pouch. \nINT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT \nIn the Hab, Terri uses the base of the 0-2 cannister to smash away the interior ice chunk, then McConnell, who's getting wobbly again, blasts the hole with the epoxy gun. As he works, Terri gives him another hit of air. \nAs Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat, McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce hug. \nWOODY (whispers) Know what? You've got enough left. \nMcConnell looks at him, understands. \nTerri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes. \nTERRI Piece of cake? \nWOODY Well. Easier than the cha-cha. \nHe scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately. \nPhil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own eyes. His voice catches for a moment. \nPHIL I don't know what you're getting so cocky about. We scored better times in the sim at least twice. \nMCCONNELL (grins) How's his hand? \nTerri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil. \nTERRI Seems OK. Couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile. Try to close your fingers, Phil, nice and slowly. \nPhil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully. \nPHIL Well, at least I'll still be able to drive. \nAfter a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars with LAUGHTER, which builds and builds; they're almost giddy with the relief of the tension... \nEXT. DEEP SPACE. DAY \nMARS RECOVERY \nSails INTO VIEW, with small attitude thrusters firing as the great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital-capture burn. Mars looks very large, blood-red. The entire spectacle is majestic, awe-inspiring. \nWOODY OK, we're ready to light this candle. Go/No Go for braking burn and MOI. Engines? \nINT. COCKPIT. DAY \nAll four astronauts are strapped in, fully suited and helmeted. Mars looms through the cockpit windows. The atmosphere is electric with excitement. \nMCCONNELL Go. \nWOODY Systems. \nTERRI Go. \nWOODY Nav. \nPHIL Go. \nWOODY We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines. \nHe flips three switches, in rapid sequence, and... \nEXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY \nAs we MOVE IN on the damaged fuel line, we see a tiny but steady spray of fuel venting from the hole caused by the meterorite. This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks, which slowly drift away from the ship. They're quite beautiful. \nPHIL (V.O.) Optimum angle of entry minus seven degrees. Six... Five... \nINT. COCKPIT. DAY \nWoody looks at the others for moment -- everyone is set, looking good -- then reaches for a last switch. \nPHIL Four... Three... \nWoody hesitates, then glances at McConnell. \nWOODY Jim? \nMcConnell, moved by this honor, nods. He reaches out to throw the switch himself. \nMCCONNELL Let's go to Mars. \nAs the countdown indicator reaches \"0000.00.00\", a final signal PINGS, and he flips the switch. \nEXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY \nIn total silence, the engines ignite. The second they do, the streamers of frozen fuel explode in a white flash. \nINT. COCKPIT. DAY \nWith alarms sounding, the four astronauts are slammed violently forward, against their restraints. \nWOODY What the -- \nMCCONNELL Shut down engines! \nHe and Woody both reach out, straining against the incredible G-forces, and manage to grab a red emergency lever, yanking it down hard. \nEXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY \nToo late! IN SLOW MOTION, we see a terrifyingly violent chain reaction. The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after another. The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship, including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded, charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes what's left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit -- to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars. \nINT. COCKPIT. DAY \nIn the windows, Mars goes crazily in and out of view. The astronauts, flung this way, then that, are all fighting against unconsciousness. \nTHEIR POV \nEveryone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them. \nTERRI \nHappens to glance directly below. \nTERRI There she is! \nTHEIR POV \nThe black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against the red of Mars. \nWOODY Jesus. She's not where I thought she'd be. \nPHIL We're going to miss her. \nWOODY \nLooks again at his display screen, frustrated. \nMCCONNELL What do you think? \nWOODY We can't catch it. Not like this. \nMCCONNELL (thinking quickly) Use the tether. \nFrom a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out... \nTHE TETHER GUN \nAbout the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner- like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun. \nMCCONNELL We'll only have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach. \nWOODY It'll be better if I leave you the gun while I run out to the REMO. I've got enough fuel left for that. \nMCCONNELL You'll be going too fast. \nWOODY I'll aim to overshoot, then brake like hell; arc it in. \nMcConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes, trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands McConnell the gun. \nWOODY Seeya in a few. \nMcConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the tether gun. \nWOODY AND THE REMO \nWoody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He checks his armpad display screen. \nWOODY Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm gonna take the edge off. \nWoody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he can. \nCLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS \nGlowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off. \nWOODY'S EYES \nShow alarm. He checks his display. \nWOODY I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long. (beat) Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with suit jets. \nWoody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets. \nWOODY'S POV \nHe's still going very quickly. \nWITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL \nFloating close together. The tether line is still unspooling from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as he races towards the REMO. Terri's heart is in her throat. \nTERRI Oh Jesus. Jesus... \nMcConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm. \nBACK ON WOODY \nStill speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out. \nWOODY Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make contact... \nMCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL \nStare at Woody's distant figure. \nINTERCUT -- \nMCCONNELL At what velocity? \nWOODY Impact's gonna be a little rough. \nMCCONNELL At what velocity? \nWOODY (beat) Thirty-two. \nWOODY You listen to Jim, honey. It's a good plan. \nTERRI No! We are going to -- \nPHIL Oh Jesus, look! The ship! \nPhil points. McConnell and Terri look. \nTHE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT \nIs now several kilometers below and behind them. It's glowing red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere. \nMCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE \nAre all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to look up again. He sees something alarming. \nMCCONNELL Look out! \nTHEIR POV \nThey are drifting quickly into the REMO. \nMCCONNELL Brakes! \nALL THREE \nFire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the tether gun. \nTHE HOOK \nReleases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door. \nMCCONNELL Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start dumping the cargo, or there won't be room for us. \nPHIL But we need those supplies for -- \nMCCONNELL Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody! \nWOODY \nIs looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that Terri has reached it safely. \nWOODY Will do, Jim. \nHe turns to look at... \nMARS \nRight below him, filling his field of view. A long beat. \nWOODY (softly) Hey, Beautiful... \nBACK AT THE REMO \nTerri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO. McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining. \nMCCONNELL Terri, no! \nBut it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO. \nMCCONNELL \nIs reaching to activate his own jets, when \nPHIL'S HAND \nGrabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half- maddened, agonized, staring after Terri. \nMCCONNELL Goddammit, Terri, it won't work! \nBut Terri keeps on going. \nWOODY \nLooks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars. Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him. \nWOODY Terri, what are you doing? \nINTERCUT -- \nTERRI I'll tell you what I'm not doing, Woody. I'm not going to watch you die. \nWOODY Terri -- \nTERRI You'd do the same for me. \nAT THE REMO \nPhil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle of Woody's suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil looks at McConnell, anguished. \nMCCONNELL Get inside. Dump the cargo, then start the systems. (Phil hesitates) Now. \nINTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI \nAs Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice. \nWOODY No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if it just wasn't possible. \nTERRI I can do it! \nHER THUMB \nHovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice, from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty years in the blink of an eye. \nMCCONNELL Come back, Terri. \nTerri's thumb is still poised. Death would be better. \nANGLE ON MCCONNELL \nOutside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside, staring out anxiously towards Terri. \nMCCONNELL (quietly, simply) He's gone. \nHe sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri. \nMCCONNELL Please, Terri... (long beat) We need you. \nTERRI'S THUMB \nPushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward. \nTERRI'S FACE \nInside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO. \nINT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY \nOn the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled \"MARS RECOVERY\" is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer figures crawls beside it. \nSUPER TITLE: \"SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG\" \nBeck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset data. \nNEW CAPCOM Okay, they're Go for the burn and MOI. Should be initiating the burn just about... now. \nSuddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks, breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes. \nA moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising babble of scared, confused voices. \nRAY BECK \nTakes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place, right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a row... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT \nThe REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. The hatch is sealed. \nINT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT \nMcConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has been opened; he's facing \nSMALL UTILITY MONITOR \nAlready glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator lights, com ports. \nMCCONNELL \nStares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He turns, looking back at \nTERRI AND PHIL \nHunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold. \nPHIL'S FACE \nIs a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear. \nTERRI \nIs worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock. \nMCCONNELL \nKnows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly. \nMCCONNELL Phil? (no response) Hey, Phil...? \nPhil looks up at him dully. \nMCCONNELL We're going in blind. We'll deploy the chutes by laptop. I need to get on the data bus, put in a software patch, and try to soften this tin can's landing. I could use your help with the patch. \nAfter a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence. \nMCCONNELL That's great. Good job. (turning to Terri) Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps? \nTerri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches for another one, begins looping them together. \nMCCONNELL \nStudies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, but at least they're moving. \nEXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER) \nSmall thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position for entry into the atmosphere. \nThen all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it falls away from us, towards Mars at night. \nEXT. ERV. DAY \nPerched atop the ERV's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover. He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand. \nPHIL I've got ERV access. I'm going in. Terri, you okay? \nEXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY \nTerri is still scooping sand. She's just cleared the first row of gauges. \nTERRI Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to get back to 100% capacity. \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY \nMcConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew taped their final, fateful message. \nHIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE \nStill sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins, startled, and sees \nHIS OWN REFLECTION. \nIn his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets. \nMCCONNELL SHIVERS \nThis place is filled with ghosts. \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY \nPhil, in the pilot's seat of the ERV, pushes a computer's power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy static. \nPHIL ERV appears structurally intact. Computers are fried, just as we thought. \nEXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY \nTerri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her heels, studying the tangle of pipes. \nTERRI Copy that. I've got busted filters here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup job, but so far no major damage. \nINT. GREENHOUSE. DAY \nAN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS. THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV \nOn a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever assortment of collection jars. Liquid water. \nMCCONNELL \nReaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, he looks down at his forearm instrument pad. \nBlinking red letters read \"25 deg. C.\" And something else -- the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in here! \nMCCONNELL \nPunches in more numbers, and gets the readout: \n\"Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%.\" \nMCCONNELL \nSlowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards his helmet. \nMCCONNELL I'm in the greenhouse. You better... you better come see this for yourselves. \nINT. ERV. DAY \nPhil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse. \nPHIL What is it? \nThere's no answer. He rises. \nEXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY \nTerri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant, translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure can be seen, moving slowly. \nTERRI Jim...? \nINT. GREENHOUSE. DAY \nMcConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has come into play. He pauses, looking up... \nOverhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with duct tape, like some giant Erector set. \nAs McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground. \nMcConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a glimpse of the almost unrecognizable \nLUKE GRAHAM \nWhose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off. \nMCCONNELL Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell! \nWe see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles in the air. \nLUKE You're not here! \nMCCONNELL Luke, it's Jim! \nLUKE ...When I came to and dug myself out of the sand, my faceplate was cracked. Leaking badly. I barely made it back to Base. It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there and look for their... \nHe has to pause, collect himself. \nLUKE Renee was the only one I could find. But it didn't seem right, somehow, to dig just one grave. \nThere is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps. He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze. \nMCCONNELL Has it been blowing like this for a while? (Luke nods) We saw a big storm from space. But Micker said it was turning south. \nLuke looks off into the distance, studies something only he seems to see. \nLUKE If it holds course. \nMcConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at Luke. \nMCCONNELL This -- whatever it was -- this force. You say it came directly out of the top of the mountain? \nLUKE You don't believe me. That's okay. But I'm not crazy, Jim. \nMcConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this. \nMCCONNELL What did you mean by its \"secret?\" What secret? \nLUKE (pause) You better see for yourselves. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY \nMcConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks. Their helmets are off. It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty. \nTHEIR POV -- \nThe Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew. \nLUKE See, where they made their mistake was, they must've planned for it to be visible from Earth... \nThe others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs his hands together, poised over the keyboard. \nMCCONNELL Who's \"they\"? \nLuke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery feverish intensity, a secret excitement. \nLUKE Don't you understand? Hundreds of millions of years have gone by. You've got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, meteor impacts -- hell, in that much time, the whole surface would've changed. So no wonder we never saw it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us too. Too much dirt on it. \nThe others exchange worried glances. Is he totally nuts? \nTERRI Saw what? \nLUKE This. \nOn the computer screen they're looking at... \nCLOSE ON THE MONITOR \nPictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground- level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face. The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural. \nMCCONNELL, PHIL AND TERRI (INT. MARS ONE HAB.) \nThey are stunned. Can hardly believe their eyes. \nPHIL Jesus... \nTERRI What is that...? \nLUKE I don't know. But whatever it is, somebody built it. And not us. \nA few moments of silence while they try to absorb this. \nMCCONNELL What about the sound? That signal you heard before the explosion? \nLUKE Good, Jim, good. That's the key. \nA click of the mouse and they all HEAR, over speakers, the DEEP PULSING BASS TONE. \nLUKE Hear the pauses? That's what made me realize it's a pattern -- a repeating pattern. \nMCCONNELL Mathematical? \nLuke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this. \nLUKE That's what I thought. There are distinct blocks in the pattern, and within each block the tones come in groups of three. Threethreethree. For months I struggled to analyze it, trying different constructs... Then I thought about dimensions. \nMCCONNELL X-Y-Z coordinates... \nLUKE Right! Three groups equals three dimensions... So I tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and tone. And finally I got... this. \nHe types another command. They all look at the monitor, the glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again. \nCLOSE ON THE MONITOR \nWhere we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally familiar double helix, of a DNA molecule -- the elegant blueprint of life. \nBACK TO SCENE (INT. MARS ONE HAB.) \nPHIL My God... Is that what I think it is? \nPHIL So what happens when it gets the right answer? \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY \nAs McConnell looks at Luke and Terri. \nMCCONNELL (hesitates) I don't know. But we've got to find out. (to Luke, pointing) Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes? Then dub them into your recording of the signal? \nLUKE I think so, yes. \nMCCONNELL What about the radar gun? Will it accept that input? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face? \nLuke stares at him, startled by what he's implying. \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY \nPhil is also growing increasingly nervous. \nPHIL Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if you're wrong? Whoever goes out there... I mean, what if you're wrong? Three people have already died over that thing. \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY \nAs Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell. \nTERRI Four. \nMcConnell looks at her. \nMCCONNELL Terri, if we leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain. \nTerri shakes her head. \nTERRI We just don't know enough about that -- that thing out there to take any more chances. \nMCCONNELL What are we here for, if not to take chances...? \nHis passion startles them; they've never seen him so emotional. He points at the computer screen. \nMCCONNELL This means we're not alone. It means we're on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind's history. But we've still got to prove it. Who knows when someone else will get back here? Or if they ever will? You know what Congress is like. They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights. We could be the last explorers to come here for decades. We're it, guys. (pause) We're it. \nLUKE (quietly) We don't have to go out there. There's a better way. \nThey look at him, surprised. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nThe familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back. Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass rumble of the Face is very loud from here. \nLUKE Checking video feed... \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY \nMcConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the image starts to sharpen. \nLUKE There! \nON THE MONITOR \nThey see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE... \nTHE FOUR ASTRONAUTS \nStare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick as he maneuvers the remote surveyor. \nMCCONNELL How close do we need to get? \nLUKE I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop by that boulder. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY \nAres-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire. \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY \nLuke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods. \nLuke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY \nFrom the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops. \nFor a moment nothing happens. \nThen the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains. \nANGLE ON THE FACE \nAs suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. No inside details can be seen. \nINT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY \nMcConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon, awed. They're barely breathing. \nPHIL Oh my God... \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK \nPhil keys his own mike. \nPHIL Yeah, Jim. Your signal's breaking up a little in the storm, but I read you. \nEXT. THE FACE. DUSK \nMcConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light. \nMCCONNELL We're at the Face. We're gonna need a few minutes here. Same deadline, launch at 1950. With or without us. Do you copy? \nPHIL (pause) Copy that. \nTerri and Luke exchange a tense glance. \nTERRI Jim, are you sure you want to do this? \nMCCONNELL I'm not sure of anything anymore. But I didn't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet. \nLuke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal. McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath. Then they walk forward together, into the light. \nINT. THE FACE. DUSK \nThe astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a free hand. \nThe light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls, ceiling, even a floor. \nMCCONNELL Surface seems firm and level. \nLUKE Roger that. Texture is smooth. \nTERRI I've got good footing and no obstructions. Let's check our -- \nBehind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them. \nTERRI It's solid again! We're trapped. \nMCCONNELL Don't move! Keep this orientation. \nThe three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the brightness, some twenty feet apart. \nMCCONNELL (keys his mike) Phil? Phil, can you still hear me? \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK \nPhil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved. \nPHIL Computers are online! Ready to load software. But guys -- we're losing visibility here. \nHe glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio. \nPHIL Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone there...? \nNo answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread. \nPHIL Don't leave me. \nINT. FACE. DUSK \nMcConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his right glove. \nTerri and Luke see this. \nTERRI (alarmed) Jim, what're you doing? You'll depressurize! \nMCCONNELL I don't think so. \nMcConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the hiss of rushing air. \nLUKE Jim, seal it! \nMCCONNELL No. That was air going into my suit, not out. Look at your own suits -- they're not rigid anymore. We've got pressure in here. \nLuke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right. \nTERRI Above Mars atmospheric? That's impossible. \nMCCONNELL We're millions of miles from Earth and we're inside a gigantic white face. What's impossible? \nTerri types on her arm keypad. She's amazed. \nTERRI There's six psi in here... (taps more keys) Nitrogen and oxygen. \nLUKE Otherwise known as air? \nTerri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. Luke follows suit. \nTERRI Hey, there may be some lethal trace gasses I haven't picked up yet, or... or... oh, the hell with it. \nTerri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed another kind of test... \nHIGH, STRIATED WALL \nAppears through the glare, soaring up before their startled eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts. \nTHE ASTRONAUTS BLINK \nRaising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame \nAnd the words: \"IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED\" \nINT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT \nMcConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds him, when something catches his attention. He arches his neck, looking down. \nA COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID \nIs beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are covered. \nMCCONNELL'S EYES \nWiden in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder but \nHIS GLOVED HANDS \nSlide helplessly across the smooth surface. \nMCCONNELL \nLooks down again. \nTHE COBALT LIQUID \nIs up to his knees. Now his thighs... \nMCCONNELL \nCranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, can he somehow climb to safety? \nABOVE HIM \nThe entire \"ceiling\" of the Face is becoming translucent. He can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a collision course. \nINT. ROVER. NIGHT \nLuke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to be heard over the ROARING WIND. \nTERRI I've lost the Base Camp beacon! \nLuke looks over alarmed. \nCLOSE ON A DIAL \nAs the needle spins freely, giving no direction whatsoever. \nTERRI No good! We're driving blind. \nLUKE I'll try to keep on a straight line! It's our only chance. \nTERRI Don't worry! I've worked with Phil for four years! I know Jim gave him a direct order, but he won't leave without us. \nEXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT \nThe Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It disappears from view! \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT \nPhil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With resignation, he keys his mike. \nPHIL This is ERV, do you read? ERV to Rover, do you read...? \nPhil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red switch that reads \"LAUNCH.\" He hesitates, then actually has his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike. \nPHIL This is ERV, do you read? \nLUKE (very faint) Save the fuel, Phil. We're coming in. \nAnd Phil chokes back a sob. Blinking back the tears, he tries to compose himself, then keys his mike. \nPHIL Uh, Phil's not here right now. He left for Earth five minutes ago. Please leave your message at the beep. \nEXT. THE FACE. NIGHT \nFROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising from the forehead of the Face, from its \"third eye,\" spinning and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex. But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, causing a dark counter-swirl. \nEXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT \nPhil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust. \nTHE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out, struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands, helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused. \nPHIL Where's Jim? \nTERRI He got another ride. \nPhil stares at her, bewildered. \nLUKE Tell you on the way. Let's go! \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. MARTIAN SHIP. NIGHT \nLOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring. \nHe strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid. \n", "test1_input": "\"MISSION TO MARS\" \nScreenplay by \nJim Thomas, John Thomas & Graham Yost \nStory by \nLowell Cannon, Jim Thomas & John Thomas \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY \nBlue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day. \nSUPER TITLE: \"HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020.\" \nAs we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE. \nPHIL T minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition... Liftoff! \nA tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, excited SHOUTS. \nEXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON \nDESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube. \nCHILDREN (all at once) My turn! My turn! No, I was next! No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can I do one? I want to do one! \nPHIL Guys, guys, please! This is risky stuff here. And I'm a highly trained professional. \nDerisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for silence. \nPHIL Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch another booster... \nAnother astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and Phil catches it. \nPHIL ...just as soon as he completes his fuel intake. \nANGLE FOLLOWS COTE \nWho grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed about. A banner, strung between trees, reads \"BON VOYAGE, MARS ONE!!!\" \nWILLIS It'll take us six months just to get to Mars. Another year on the surface, then six months back. That's two years... \nPassing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well. \nWILLIS I guess what I'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on Earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. Y'know? \nPRETTY GIRL Nice try, Nick. \nAs the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his beer, swigs it. \nANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open- pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily at the chef. \nKIROV Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty good long rendezvous. \nWOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a Hawaiian shirt and a \"KISS THE CHEF\" apron. An entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting this as he smiles at Malik. \nWOODY What are you suggesting, Sergei? \nKIROV Maybe you should bring a baseball bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series. \nWOODY Please. Half you guys are foreigners. We'd crush you. \nKIROV No, no, we have equal crews. Three men, one woman. Same handicap. \nHe grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him. \nWOODY Easy now, you're talking about my wife. (seeing her approach) And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop. \nDR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. Then she glances at Kirov, all business now. \nTERRI Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. Thousand bucks make it interesting? \nHe's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement. \nCOTE Eh bien. Winner take all. \nTERRI Good. (smiles sweetly at Kirov) Bring some balls. \nThe other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt grin. \nWOODY You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of \"Yes, dears.\" \nThe others laugh. \nANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad. \n1ST WIFE ...just not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples to go on this type of mission together. \nOne of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter. \n1ST WIFE (embarrassed) Nothing personal, Terri. It's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind. \nTERRI (carefully neutral) All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips. \n", "test1_true": "Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really have much in common with these women -- before moving on. ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around. \n3RD WIFE Anybody seen Jim McConnell? \n4TH WIFE I don't think he's coming. \n1ST WIFE God, that poor man. How's he doing? \n2ND WIFE Totally losing it, from what I hear. Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her grave almost every day. (lowers her voice) They say he could lose mission status. \n3RD WIFE Oh, that's so sad. That is just so tragic. You go to a routine physical one day, and wham. \n4TH WIFE After all those years of training, too. It was their whole dream. \n1ST WIFE Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna be in the history books. First man on Mars... \nShe shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in agreement, following her glance... \nIn the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him. \nCLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her with an apologetic smile. \nDEBRA He's not coming, Luke. \nLUKE Jim deserves this, too. All his friends are here. And it's my last night. \nDEBRA (gently) Your last night with us, too. \nHe looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his arms around her waist, kisses her forehead. \nLUKE I love you, Deb. \nDEBRA I love you too, baby. But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby. \nLUKE Yeah. I will. Where is he? \nDEBRA Up in his fort. \nHe kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, with a mixture of pride and sadness. \nANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into \nEXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON \nLuke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead. \nIn the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to PRETTY GIRL #2. \nWILLIS Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. But I guess I'll have my memories to keep me warm... \nLuke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder. \nA SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby on a tripod. He looks lonely. \nLuke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky. \nBOBBY Who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime? \nLuke is surprised by the question. A pause. \nLUKE Mommy will. \nBOBBY I like when you do it. Now we're never gonna finish our book. \nHis voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. Luke is moved. Another brief silence. \nLUKE Well, I'll tell you what. I've been thinking about that. And what I thought was -- how 'bout if I bring along my own copy? (Bobby looks at him) Then every night, wherever I am, I'll read a little bit more of it. And I'll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. That way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'Cause I don't know about you, but I'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island. What d'you say? \nBobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. Luke is proud of his son's courage. \nLUKE Good deal. Can I have a hug? \nBobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. They both turn. \nAn open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone. \nLuke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness. \nEXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON \nThe Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards the party, then pauses again. \nDebra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She smiles tentatively. \nJIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in. \nYet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural leader. \nDebra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining. \nDEBRA We were afraid you wouldn't come. \nMCCONNELL I caught a whiff of your barbecue. After that I was helpless. \nDEBRA All the way out in Galveston? \nMCCONNELL Something like that. (she smiles) It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it. \nDEBRA Spoil it? He's been going crazy looking for you. \n", "test2_input": "Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nCote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain. Luke turns to Cote. \nLUKE Well? What's under there? \nCOTE (puzzled) Je ne sais pas. I... I think there's something wrong with the equipment. \nLUKE What? \nCOTE I mean, it can't be right. It says... it says there's metal under there. \nLuke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the display screen. \nCOTE (points) There's ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand, and then... solid metal. \nLUKE That doesn't make any sense. You're reading a vein of ore. \nCOTE (shakes her head) No. It's under the whole mountain. \nThe deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns. \nLUKE Nick, could the problem with the antenna be interfering? \nWILLIS Could be. \nLUKE (to Cote and Kirov) Try it closer and up the power. I'll watch the screen. \nINT. MMCR. DAY \nMcConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N. ambassadors. \nMCCONNELL Ah, we're all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted, Mars One. The folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every photomap they've got. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nCote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain, resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating tone continues. \nLuke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis, who's still working on the rover's antenna. \nLUKE Nick, how we coming on that antenna? \nWILLIS Goin' as fast as I can, boss. \nCote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis. \nKIROV Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I am. I can't get this to work. \nWillis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts towards the radar gun. \nINT. MMCR. DAY \nMcConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it. \nMCCONNELL Medical wants me to remind you that you're three days late on your blood tests. I know they're a bore, but you've got to get them done, or else... or else I don't know what. Just do them, okay? \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nWillis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running. \nKIROV All set here, chief. \nLuke sidles over to the display screen on the rover. \nLUKE Okay. Crank up the juice and let's see what's in this sucker. \nINT. MMCR. DAY \nMcConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates. \nMCCONNELL I think that's about it for business. But on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a damn. \nLAUGHTER in the MMCR. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nLuke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound... \nKIROV \nFlips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops. \nLUKE \nLooks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression. \nLUKE Why did that stop? \nA split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH, a mighty rushing of wind, as \nA GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER \nStarts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface of the slopes. \nTHE FOUR ASTRONAUTS \nStare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too fascinated to even be scared. \n", "test2_true": "We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent outer \"skin\". \nTHE ASTRONAUTS \nExchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes... \nINT. MMCR. DAY \nMcConnell still hovers by the microphone. \nMCCONNELL Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't have anything better to do with your time, I can make some suggestions to mission medical. There are worse things than blood tests. \nLAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nLuke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns. \nSAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE \nAs the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is becoming more general across the area. More violent. \nLUKE IS ALARMED \nAnd the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him, retreating. \nLuke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off the cylinder. \nThen he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved. In fact he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries over to him, tugs his sleeve. \nWILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA \nBut still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees \nTHE TOP OF THE VORTEX \nBeginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they're looking into the huge open \"mouth\" of it, as sand and rocks fly into the swirling darkness... \nThe monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little group of astronauts. And lunges towards them... \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nLuke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards the rover. But the suction is so great, it's as if they're held back by wires. \nThe ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex, the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight train... \nAHEAD OF THEM \nIn the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast. \nSuddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets... \nLUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP \nAs bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An instant later he sees \nKIROV \nSnatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream as he vanishes... \nTHE GROUND AT LUKE'S FEET \nAbruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him alive... \nCLOSE ON LUKE \nBarely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final instant, as... \nHIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS \nIs sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning and tumbling like a rag doll... \nCLOSE ON WILLIS'S FACE \nHis features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, and... \nDISTANT ANGLE - LUKE'S POV \nWillis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as abruptly... \nSTOPS. Vanishes. \nThere is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own way as the roaring storm itself had been... \nWIDE ANGLE \nOn the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away, settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again calm, peaceful. \nAnd then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns. \nINT. MMCR. DAY \nAs McConnell finishes his message to Luke. \nMCCONNELL Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and Bobby are doing fine. Said to tell you, they're, ah, they're on their \"third time through the book, page -- (glances at a note) -- page 125.\" They send their love and say take care of yourself. Same from us here, buddy. Till next time, then. End of transmission. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY \nMOVING ANGLE, the CAMERA EXPLORING ground zero, as the bass, pulsing rumble continues... \n", "test3_input": "MCCONNELL \nIs in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands. \nMCCONNELL They're us. We're them... \nLUKE We're Martians...? \nMCCONNELL That's what she means. \nTERRI Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion. \nMcConnell and Luke look at her. \nTERRI Almost six hundred million years ago, there was a sudden expansion of life on Earth. The first multi-celled plants and animals appeared. No one has ever understood why... \nLUKE They seeded Earth. \nWe hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow. \nTHE ASTRONAUTS \nStep back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter here, like stars against a midnight sky. \nTHE MARTIAN \nSteps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core. \nMCCONNELL \nLooks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes. \nLuke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor. \nPHIL (over radio) ...in, please. Can you... me? \nTerri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike. \nTERRI Phil, we're here! We read you. \nEven through the scratchy interference, they can hear the relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation. \nPHIL Thank God! Listen, this storm is really -- (loud static) -- few more minutes, I can't -- (more static) You've gotta get back to the ship! \nAnd then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost. \nTERRI Phil? Phil...? \nSuddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as \nTHE FIRST ORANGE BAND \nBegins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri. \nMCCONNELL We are in a ship. This is a ship. And the countdown has already started. \nTerri looks at Luke, alarmed. \nLUKE He's right. \nTERRI Then let's get the hell out of here! \nShe scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of the colored rings. \nLUKE Jim... \nMcConnell doesn't turn. \nLUKE Jim, we gotta go. \nMCCONNELL I'm not coming with you. \nTERRI (stunned) What? \nComing back, she sees how calm he is. How certain. \nTERRI What are you talking about? We've got to get home. \nMCCONNELL That's where I'm going. Don't you see? That's what all this is for. (McConnell gestures at the ship around them) You were right Terri. This is an invitation. To follow them. To follow them home. \nHe looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half smile. \nMCCONNELL I have to go. This is the mission now. To find out who we are. Isn't that why we came here? Like Maggie said, \"To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one.\" \nLuke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them both. \nMCCONNELL You know, when you think about it -- I wasn't even supposed to be here -- all the accidents, everything that got us to this point, it's just... it's just... I just know it's right. \nTerri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands. \nMCCONNELL I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But you're running out of time. You've gotta get back to the ERV and get off this planet. Now please go. \nLuke steps closer, looking at his old friend. \nLUKE I once felt like I was taking your turn. But now I think maybe you're taking mine. Guess I'm a little jealous. \nThey clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell. \nLUKE Thanks for saving my life. \n", "test3_true": "Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet, as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken beat. Her eyes are glistening. \nTERRI I wish Woody were here to see this. He would've wanted to go too, Jim. \nTerri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She's going to be okay. \nMCCONNELL He's here, Terri. We wouldn't have made it without him. \nTerri nods. She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes around it. \nTERRI Take care, Jim. \nMcConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns, picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused, looking back. \nLUKE Hey, Jim...? \nMCCONNELL Yeah? \nLUKE Have a great ride. \nMCCONNELL Always do. \nLuke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, then hurry away, into the darkness. \nMCCONNELL \nLooks down at what Terri gave him. \nIT'S WOODY'S NECK CHAIN \nWith the little Flash Gordon rocketship. \nMCCONNELL \nGrips this tightly as he looks up. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT \nThe hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri, helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of the dust storm is upon them. They can't see much more than a few meters. \nAs they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike. \nLUKE Phil? Phil, do you read? (to Terri) He's not reading. \nTERRI I can barely read you. Let's get the hell out of here! \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT \nPHIL Is anyone there? Can anyone read me? \nPhil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He hesitates, then starts hitting some keys. \nCLOSE ON HIS COMPUTER DISPLAY \nWhich reads: \"PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST.\" \nINT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT \nMcConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the indigo circle at their core. He looks at \nTHE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR \nAs it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous now, very deep and rapid. \nEXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT \nThe rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME. \nINT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT \nMcConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly \nA TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER \nBegins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up from the circumference of the indigo circle. \nThen a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube. \nMCCONNELL \nFights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift. \nINT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT \nPhil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his \nDIGITAL CLOCK \nWhich reads \"1350.\" \nPHIL IS STRICKEN, TORMENTED \nHis finger hovers over a \"Fire\" button. He licks his lips nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button. \nCLOSE ON COMPUTER DISPLAY \n"}

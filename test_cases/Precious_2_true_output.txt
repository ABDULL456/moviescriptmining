PRECIOUS What's the big deal?

135   CONTINUED: (4)                                             135 MS. RAIN Precious, have you ever had your hearing tested? 
PRECIOUS No. I never really had nothing tested...nothing like that. Glasses is what I really want so my eyes don't hurt when I be reading at night. 
The sound of a RUMBLING BUS ENGINE accelerating leads us to... 
136   INT. CITY BUS - DAY                                        136 
Rita looks out the window of a moving 102 bus and then steps across the aisle and sits beside Precious who stares out the window pensively. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Rita and me on our way. I look at subway map sometimes and wonder where I be if I go to the end of the line. Jermaine say there be a white boy wif a baseball bat when you get off. Rita say it's not true, or if it be true, it's only part true. 
The bus comes to a stop and the girls dash out the back door. 
137   EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                     137 
Precious and Rita climb up out of the subway. 
138   EXT. STREET - DAY                                          138 
Precious and Rita walk with Precious looking around as Rita hums quietly. 
139   INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY                                    139 
In a simple meeting room, women of all different ages, colors and strata sit in a large circle. 
IRENE, A GORGEOUS SLENDER BLOND WITH LUSTROUS HAIR AND SPARKLING EYES stands. 
(CONTINUED) 
139   CONTINUED:                                                139 IRENE Hello and welcome to our Tuesday night beginner's meeting...My name is Irene. I am an incest survivor... 
Precious looks utterly amazed. Her jaw drops. From here, the women's voices are so faint that they are barely audible as we hear Precious' thoughts. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                             IRENE This girl look like a movie       It started when I was about 4 star and she in here too?!        or 5 years old with him All kinda women in here.          fondling me. By the time I Princess girls, big girls,        was 12, he was having old women, young women, white     intercourse with me 3 or 4 women, lotta white women.         Times a week... 
A montage of other women standing and speaking follows. As the women talk, Precious' face fills with the wonder of seeing the world through the window of a spacecraft headed for re-entry. 
CANDACE, SIXTIES, WHITE speaks next. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CANDACE What am I hearing?! What in       ....I didn't remember what my h the world?! One hour and a        father did to me for so many alf women talk. How can this     years until after he died... happen to so many people?

Do I         of. I was confined to a pass them in the street and       mental institution for 14 do not know?                      years.... 
Finally, Precious stands. 
She looks around as if seeing from the top of a mountain. 
Finally she clears her throat and then ... 
PRECIOUS I was raped by my father and beat by my mother ever since I could remember anything at all. Raped and beat by both. 
(CONTINUED) 
139   CONTINUED: (2)                                             139 The worst part about it...the part even worse than them doin' it...was how shamed I felt during the times when my father was raping me and it felt ...good. Anyway, I see a girl and always think I know how easy or bad she have it just by lookin'. Now I wonder if everybody go through sumthin' -sumthin' that leave a shadow in they life. (exhales) Never said alla that before... 
Precious looks around the room to find herself surrounded by understanding eyes. 
PRECIOUS Anyway, thas all I'd like to say for today. Thank y'all for letting me share... 
Irene nods and Precious sits. Rita squeezes her hand. Another woman stands up to recount her story. Precious looks aglow. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Everything is floating around me now. Like geeses from the lake. I see flying. Feel flying. Am flying. Far up...Thank you Rita for getting me here on time. 
140   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MEETING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER     140 
The group slowly emerges. A table with a nice arrangement of cookies stands next to a coffee maker and soda machine. 
Irene chats with Candace over a cup of coffee. Precious and Rita talk with TWO OTHER YOUNG WOMEN, MIRIAM, BLACK 20's LONG PRETTY DREADLOCKS and LISA, WHITE 20's. 
PRECIOUS ...How you get your hair like that? 
MIRIAM Oh, you like it? I do yours one day if you want. That's what I do - fix people's hair and makeup. 
Miriam hands Precious a card. Precious reads the card carefully and puts it away with care. 
PRECIOUS Thank you Miriam.

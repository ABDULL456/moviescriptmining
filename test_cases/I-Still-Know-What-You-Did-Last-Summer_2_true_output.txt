Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of a drawer and starts down the hallway. 
JULIE (cont'd) (fatalistic) Let's just do it. 
She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway. It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room. 
6F	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position. 
She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet. 
INT THE CLOSET 
KARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a box of shoes. She SCREAMS. 
Julie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and flashlight. 
KARLA I thought you were out of town! 
JULIE What are you doing in my closet? 
They hug, jumping up and down with relief. 
KARLA I thought you were out of town! 
JULIE What are you doing in my closet? 
KARLA i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them! 
Julie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her hand and black pants draped over her arm. 
JULIE That was heart attack time, Karla. 
KARLA No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time. 
Karla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two fingers -- 
KARLA (cont'd) And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me. 
Julie flops down on her bed. 
JULIE I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed. 
KARLA Yeah, right -- whatever. 
JULIE I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings. 
KARLA (keeping it upbeat) Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street. 
Karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet. 
JULIE There's nothing between Will and me. 
KARLA (V.O.) Yet. Nothing yet. 
She emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit. 
KARLA (cont'd) What we gotta do is keep moving. No time to mope. I'm working at the club tonight. And you, dancing queen, are coming with me. 
JULIE No I'm not. 
Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one. 
KARLA Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed. 
Karla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the dress when Karla hands it to her. 
CUT TO: 
7	INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT 
It's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and rivers of cheap booze. 
AT THE BAR 
Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order. 
A handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN, 23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile. 
TYRELL You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone. 
KARLA (playful) I don't think so. It's pretty crowded. 
TYRELL Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you. 
He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something. 
KARLA (teasing) If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. 
TYRELL I'll talk real slow. 
He's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.

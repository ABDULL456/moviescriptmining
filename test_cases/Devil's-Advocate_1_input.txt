MILTON A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique. And her neck, if she's alive, has the very mystery of a border town. It's the no man's land in the battle between mind and body. (beat) You know, your natural color would really bring out your eyes... 
Mary Ann frozen there, as we --

Kevin standing at the rail.    He looks over.   Christabella not ten feet away. 
CHRISTABELLA Do you have this view? 
KEVIN Sorry? 
CHRISTABELLA From your terrace, is this your view? 
KEVIN Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about twelve floors down. What about you? 
CHRISTABELLA No, I live downtown. This is the family building. 
KEVIN Sounds like fun. Downtown, I mean. I'm just getting to know the city. 
CHRISTABELLA Is it everything you expected? 
KEVIN More. 
CHRISTABELLA (raising her glass) May we always have more than we expect. Salute. 
KEVIN Amen. 
CHRISTABELLA Are you alone? 
KEVIN You mean, tonight? 
CHRISTABELLA Is your wife a jealous woman? (beat) Silly question. We're all jealous, aren't we? (MORE)

CHRISTABELLA (CONT'D) (laughing) Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away. 
KEVIN I doubt it. 
CHRISTABELLA You like to be on top, don't you? 
KEVIN Excuse me? 
CHRISTABELLA Of the situation. You prefer to be on top. 
KEVIN Depends on the view. 
MILTON (O.S.) You know what I see? 
Milton in the doorway.      He's been watching them. 
MILTON I see the future of this law firm. (perfect Italian) Christabella, cara, prestamelo per favore, pe lo riporto piu tardi. 
CHRISTABELLA It's a boring party, anyway. (to Kevin) Ciao. 
Kevin can't help watching her walk away. 
MILTON Look,   we gotta talk. You grab Heath   and Eddie Barzoon and get up to   my place right away. And let's   be quiet about it.

Getting louder and wilder. Mary Ann looking lost. Searching for Kevin... He's not here... not there... 
MARY ANN Have you seen Kevin? 
Jackie Heath shaking her head no, as Mary Ann continues on through the party.

Mary Ann still looking for Kevin. Scanning faces. Stopping as she reaches a door. Opening it and -- 
80   INT. BARZOON APARTMENT - STUDY - NIGHT                          80 
Just enough light to make out two MEN standing across the room. Silhouettes against the window. 
MARY ANN Sorry... (in doorway) I'm looking for my husband. 
The Men -- two vaguely familiar faces from the firm. 
MAN #1 Don't think he's here. 
Suddenly, a WOMAN's head rises INTO FRAME -- 
WOMAN It's just us... 
MAN #2 But feel free to join in... 
And suddenly it's clear, she's walked in on an impromptu menage a trois. The Woman is kneeling on a table, dress hiked up, ass in the air. Man #1 fucking her from behind. Man #2 is getting blown and -- 
Mary Ann IN SHOT as the woman begins to laugh and the door WIPES the FRAME.

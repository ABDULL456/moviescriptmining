Pete's face relaxes; as do the grim faces of the others. 
HAVEN (grinning) I ain't hot. I'm just mixed up. 
PETE Forget it. I got a load for you to take back when you're done here. 
HAVEN Sure. 
PETE How soon? 
HAVEN Well, I haven't eaten anything but dust since sun-up. 
PETE All right -- grab it quick. (to the others) Work on this stuff. 
They start unloading and Haven goes to the cook house. Pete watches him go. Ben notes it. 
BEN What do you think? 
PETE We risk him, that's all. 
BEN He don't look right to me. 
PETE He don't look any worse than the rest of it looks right now. (turning) Come on, get this junk out. 
He lends a hand with Ben and Sam. 
INT. COOKHOUSE - DAY 
A big pot of stew is simmering on the fire. The cook is busy slicing french fries. Haven enters. 
HAVEN How about a handout? 
COOK Help yourself. 
Haven begins ladling out some stew into a bowl, tastes it. 
HAVEN You cook pretty good. 
COOK I ought to. I used to cook for six hundred men a day. 
HAVEN Where was that? 
COOK Leavenworth. 
Haven shrugs and takes more stew; the cook goes on cutting the potatoes. 
HAVEN This used to be my mother's special dish. She made it right out of the world. 
COOK My old woman couldn't boil a potato. 
Haven takes another gulp in the silence that follows. Then he says carelessly: 
HAVEN Who's boss around here? 
COOK I am. 
HAVEN I mean the whole works. 
COOK You talked to the man when you came in. 
HAVEN Real tough-looking fellah. 
COOK (spits) They're all tough till they get to Mick Marion. 
HAVEN Mick come out here? 
COOK Last night -- and he looked like somebody got to him. 
HAVEN How's that? 
COOK Face all beat up -- (casually) Like your knuckles. 
HAVEN I had bad luck with a crate of cauliflower. 
COOK That's what he brought down here -- a cauliflower face. (casually) You fight him? 
HAVEN (smiling blandly) Mick? Do I look like I would? 
COOK (looking at him) Just the knuckles. 
Ben's head appears in the doorway. 
BEN Hurry it up, driver! 
HAVEN Comin'. 
Haven takes a last mouthful, turns toward the door.

GUY You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony. 
BRUNO Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from today's stock reports to Li'l Abner, and I got the answer. (MORE)

BRUNO (CONT'D) Even news about people I don't know. Like who'd like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce. 
GUY (sharply) Perhaps you read too much. 
BRUNO (contritely) There I go again. Too friendly. I meet someone I' like and open my yap too wide. I'm sorry... At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents. 
GUY That's all right. Forget it.    I guess I'm pretty jumpy. 
Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter. 
BRUNO There's a new cure for that. (to waiter) Scotch and plain water. A pair. Double. (to Guy with a chuckle) Only kind of doubles I play. 
GUY You'll have to drink both of them. 
BRUNO (grinning) And I can do it. (moving in) When's the wedding? 
GUY What? 
BRUNO The wedding. You and Anne Burton. (a gesture of explanation) It was in the papers. 
GUY It shouldn't have been. Unless they've legalized bigamy overnight.

BRUNO I have a theory about that. I'd like to tell you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the simplest operation. 
The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a glass to Guy. Guy takes it. 
GUY (as if he needs it) I guess I will. BRUNO (happily) This is wonderful -- having your company all the way to New York. 
GUY (forced to explain) As a matter of fact, I'm not going direct. I'm stopping off. At Metcalf. 
BRUNO Metcalf? What would anybody want to go there for? 
GUY It's my home town. 
BRUNO Oh, I get it! A little talk with your wife to about the divorce! I suppose she was the girl next door. Held her hand in high school and before you knew it -- hooked! (proud of his perspicacity) Am I right? 
GUY (laconically) Close enough. 
BRUNO (raises his glass) Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up -- then we'll have some lunch sent to my compartment.

GUY Thanks very much. But I think I'll go to the dining car. (he hails a waiter who is passing through with a food-laden tray) Do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now? 
WAITER Not for about twenty minutes I'm afraid, Sir. 
BRUNO (pleased) See? You'll have to lunch with me. (motions the waiter back) Say, waiter, bring me some lamb chops and French fries and chocolate ice cream, Compartment D, Car 121. (turns to Guy) What'll you have, Guy? 
GUY Thanks just the same, but I really don't think -- 
BRUNO Oh, go on and order. 
The waiter is hovering impatiently.   Guy gives in out of embarrassment. 
GUY Well, I'll Just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee. 
BRUNO (delighted, lifts his glass in another toast) To the next Mrs. Haines. 
Guy nods curtly.

INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS) 
Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table. Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again. 
BRUNO Sure, I went to college. Three of them. Every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in. (bitterly) He finally gave up. He thinks I'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait. (wistfully) You my friend, Guy? 
GUY Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno. 
BRUNO (a little woozy) No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm anything special. Only my mother. (empties the bottle into his glass) My father hates me. 
Guy smiles this off as nonsense. 
GUY You must be imagining things. 
BRUNO (hitting the bottom of the bottle for the last drop) And I hate him. He thinks   I ought to catch the eight-five bus  every morning, punch a timeclock  and work my way up selling paint or  something. Him -- with all his money! 
GUY (amused by Bruno) Well, what do you want to do? 
BRUNO You mean before or after I kill him?

GUY (chuckling) Before, of course. 
BRUNO (leaning forward eagerly) I want to do everything. I got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. Have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour? 
GUY Not lately. BRUNO I did. I flew in a jet plans too. (his hand traces a swift streak through the air, and he adds sound effects) Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill! Almost blow the sawdust out of my head. I'm going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon... 
GUY (amused and curious) What are you trying prove? 
BRUNO I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky. You're smart. Marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?

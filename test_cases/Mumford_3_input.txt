A PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination on the desk in front of Mumford. The problem is -- Mumford is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination paper keeps changing shape. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) All that fun eventually had an impact on the work I was doing. I figured, what the hell, it was only college, after all. I'd straighten up when I went out in the real world... 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into Mumford's palm over a water fountain. They disappear toward camera as we dip down toward the stream of water. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I didn't want to jump into my career right out of college. And since I had no career, that turned out to be not much of a problem... 
MUMFORD'S POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the endless, deserted corridor of the huge building. We begin TRACKING DOWN the hall, checking out the various doorways. A Cleaning Crew appears far up ahead. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I had a series of challenging jobs over the next few years... 
EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM. 
INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON TWO LINES of cocaine. We DIP TOWARD THEM, then UP AGAIN and they're gone. PAN to REVEAL we're in a closet off the brightly-lit office of an all-night gas station. A PATRON is waiting impatiently out by the pumps. 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT 
BACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently. 
MUMFORD ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, pest control... lots of jobs that started with the letter "p". For some reason, I kept losing these jobs. (takes a swig of beer) The only mind-altering substance I never had a problem with was alcohol. I never got drunk. I didn't like the feeling. But really, when you're as fucked up as I was... big deal. 
Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing facing Skip. 
MUMFORD Eventually, doing all these different jobs, I noticed something. For some reason, probably because I was too stoned to talk, everywhere I went -- 
INT./EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS 
We see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The environments are radically different, but the activity is always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his heart out to camera. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) -- people would talk to me, tell me everything... their stories, their problems, their innermost thoughts. Sometimes they'd pretend they needed advice, but mostly people just wanted someone to listen. 
INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER HOUSE - DAY 
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV as he crawls into the darkness, an insecticide sprayer ahead of him. He pushes at a cinderblock -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Anyway, one day I was spraying for termites when I had a vision -- 
The cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders comes rushing out toward camera. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) -- it was time to put my college degree to work and get a job with a desk. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICES - DAY 
FROM BEHIND A DESK in the middle of a huge sea of desks. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I took the civil service exam and found myself working at the Internal Revenue Service, District 14, Central Administrative Office. I started off as a general records clerk... 
SERIES OF SHOTS: computer records scrolling rapidly, paper files being pulled, documents being routed. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) I guess the standards weren't too high there, because my superiors got excited and pushed me to take the advancement tests... 
INT. YMCA GYM - NIGHT 
An intense basketball game. The ball zips from behind camera (Mumford) to an older guy, MUMFORD'S SUPERVISOR, under the basket; he lays it in easily, then comes over to high-five. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) One guy in particular thought I should be a Revenue Officer. There was more money to be made as your classification went up. Which had a lot of appeal to me... 
INT. KITCHEN TABLE, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT (PAST) - NIGHT 
A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins. Spread across the messy kitchen table is the regular user's paraphernalia. 
MUMFORD (V.O.) ...since, even though I was certain I could stop anytime I wanted, I had developed a real affection for cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I had ever had. 
INT. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY 
MUMFORD'S POV SHIFTS around the office. First, he's looking at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE OFFICER, who remains unruffled -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue Officer, where you were face to face abusing -- and getting abused -- all day long...

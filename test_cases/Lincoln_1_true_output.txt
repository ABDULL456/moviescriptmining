ELIZABETH KECKLEY Then you'll see to it. 
Lincoln looks at her, considering. Then: 
LINCOLN Are you afraid of what lies ahead? For your people? If we succeed? 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY White people don't want us here. 
LINCOLN Many don't. 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY What about you? 
LINCOLN I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley. Any of you. You're ...familiar to me, as all people are. Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked creatures such as we all are. You have a right to expect what I expect, and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other. I assume I'll get used to you. But what you are to the nation, what'll become of you once slavery's day is done, I don't know. 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY What my people are to be, I can't say. Negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom since the first of us was a slave. I never heard any ask what freedom will bring. Freedom's first. As for me: My son died, fighting for the Union, wearing the Union blue. For freedom he died. I'm his mother. That's what I am to the nation, Mr. Lincoln. What else must I be? 
INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - LATE NIGHT 
The room is far filthier and more cluttered than before. Bilbo and Latham are playing cards. Schell is asleep in bed. 
W.N. BILBO My whole hand's gonna be proud in about five seconds, let's see how proud you gonna be. 
ROBERT LATHAM Oh, it is? What you got goin'? 
There's a quick knock on the door. 
W.N. BILBO Yeah? 
ROBERT LATHAM Go away! (TO BILBO) That watch fob, is that gold? 
W.N. BILBO You keep your eyes off my fob! 
Seward enters, displeased, as they show their cards, laughing. 
ROBERT LATHAM Nines paired! 
W.N. BILBO Oh my God damn! 
SEWARD Gentlemen. You have a visitor. 
Latham jovially collects his winnings. He stops short when Lincoln steps into the room, cloak and stovepipe, very tall. 
W.N. BILBO Well, I'll be fucked. 
LINCOLN I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...? 
Schell startles awake as Bilbo puts down his cigar and wipes his hand on his vest. 
W.N. BILBO W.N. Bilbo. 
LINCOLN Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen. 
ROBERT LATHAM Sir... 
W.N. BILBO Why are you here? No offense, but Mr. Seward's banished the very mention of your name, he won't even 
let us use fifty-cent pieces `cause they got your face on `em. 
LINCOLN The Secretary of State here tells me that, uh, you got eleven Democrats in the bag. That's encouraging. 
ROBERT LATHAM Oh, you've got no cause to be encouraged. Sir. Uh... 
RICHARD SCHELL Are we being...fired? 
Lincoln sits at the card table. 
LINCOLN "We have heard the chimes of midnight, Master Shallow." I'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us. 
RICHARD SCHELL The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir. The patronage jobs simply won't bag `em. They require more...convincing, Mr. President. 
Lincoln nods. He turns to Bilbo. 
LINCOLN Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya?

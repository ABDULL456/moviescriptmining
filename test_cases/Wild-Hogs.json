{"test1_input": "DOUG \nDUDLEY-- \nDUDLEY \n(IGNORING DOUG) I wish! I just have a Sportster. It's worth, like, half of yours. \nJACK A Sportster!? That's what I grew up on. I've been wanting another Sportster. It's a deal! \nDUDLEY Seriously? You're serious!? \nDOUG Dudley, maybe you should-- \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 46. \nDUDLEY Doug, don't worry. Yeah, I'll have a cooler bike than you, but that doesn't mean I'll get all cocky. \nDOUG \nDUDLEY-- \nDUDLEY Hey, I don't care what you say! I ride a panhead now! I'm better than you! \nJACK Come on, Dud. Let's go see how you look on it. Jack smiles and leads Dudley outside. Doug, Bob and Woody share an uncertain look. \nWOODY Anybody else got that \"pre-rape\" feeling? \nEXT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS \nEveryone is standing out front. Dudley starts to get on the classic motorcycle. Jack stops him. \nJACK Oh, no, no. That's Oilcan's ride. My ' 51 panhead is right over there. Jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles. Among it is the junked carcass of a '51 panhead next to an old, rusty sidecar. Dudley looks confused. \nDUDLEY That? That's a piece of junk. \nJACK Yup. Your piece of junk. Woody, Doug and Bob look at each other. This isn't good. Doug tries to laugh it off. \nDOUG All right, guys. We get the joke... Good one. Anyway, we actually should get moving along. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 47. \nJACK Oh, it's no joke. You want to know the joke? Suburban assholes that buy leather outfits and think they're bikers. And it's a joke I'm damn sick of. So I'm keeping your friend's bike, I'm keeping this jacket, and you guys are going to turn the hell around and go back to wherever you came from, because the next hundred miles of this highway belongs to the Hells Angels. The color drains from the Wild Hog's faces. \nDUDLEY Like an adopt a highway thing? \nJACK Like a \"Go home or we're going to split your skulls open\" thing. Bob makes an audible whimper. Doug elbows him, and tries to look brave. \nDOUG All right. We respect that this is your turf, and we're sorry for bothering you. But we can't head back without my friend's bike. So clearly we're going to have to work something out here. Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods. \nJACK You're right. We're going to have to work something out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER \nWe see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar, looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt). The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody waves for them to stop. They do and Woody looks back to the bar. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 48. \nWOODY All right. Let's just give them a few minutes to get back inside - then shoot right past them. \nBOB What? Are you nuts? \nDOUG The trip's over, Woody. Let's just head back home. \nWOODY We're going to turn back after all these miles? Just because some fat bully's pushed us around? \nDOUG BOB Yes. Yes. Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley. \nDUDLEY I go wherever you go. \nWOODY Good. See? Dudley's got some balls. \nDUDLEY No, my sidecar's just attached to your bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I could only roll so far... \n", "test1_true": "DOUG That's the point, Woody. Our lives aren't on this highway. They're back home. We have families, jobs, wives... or cats... We're not going to piss off a biker gang. We're going back. Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment. \nDOUG (CONT'D) Come on, Woody. You don't want to take this risk. You have Claudia, and your job... You have a great life back home. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 49. Woody looks up at him. Something about this has sparked something in Woody's eyes, but he covers it up with a calm smile. \nWOODY You're right, I do. But maybe I should talk to those guys one more time. I mean, I'm an executive at an Investment firm. I've made a career out of convincing people and these are just people. You guys wait here. Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each other and shrug. Dudley hurries out of the sidecar. \nDUDLEY I'll wait here, too. You'll get better gas mileage. Dudley gets out and falls to the ground. \nDUDLEY (CONT'D) Leg's asleep. Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar. \nEXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME \nWoody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods. \nWOODY \n(TO HIMSELF) Come after us now, assholes. Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird recklessness as he slices through each gas line. \nEXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nWOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are waiting. \nWOODY They're cool with it. We can press on. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 50. \nBOB Seriously? \nWOODY Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to reason. I told them Dudley was dying. \nDUDLEY What? \nWOODY Well, technically we're all dying, Dudley. Just very slowly. Dudley looks concerned. \nDUDLEY Oh my god, you're right. \n(REALIZING) I'm slowly dying. \nWOODY Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid it out for them. I said, \"Hey, go ahead and assault us. Because we might be not be real bikers, but we know real lawyers. And the moment you touch us is the moment you get your ass sued. Because this is the real world - with real laws, and real consequences.\" And they backed down. The guys are impressed. \nDOUG You really said that? \nWOODY Yup. And I think they'll give us Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's go. Quick. Before they change their mind. Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys shrug, impressed, and follow him. After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar. \nINT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME \nJack is playing darts with the other bikers. He goes to throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 51. He quickly turns, which makes the dart he was throwing fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the bikers, (OILCAN). \nOILCAN Ow! Shit, man! Jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away. Jack shakes his head, enraged. \nJACK Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen. The guys nod and head outside. Oilcan pulls the dart out of his shoulder, and stops by Jack on the way out. \nOILCAN Try and watch the throws, okay Jack? Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into his peck. \nOILCAN (CONT'D) Owww! Jesus! (off Jack's icy glare) Sorry. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BIKER BAR - A MINUTE LATER \nThe Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their motorcycles. They get to the end of the driveway, and the bikes sputter and choke to a stop. ANGLE ON: JACK. He's on his hog, with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. He looks down in confusion at the suddenly stalled bike. \nJACK What the f-- (sees cut gas line) You've gotta be kidding me. Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and onto the ground. A puddle of gas from the sliced line catches on fire. \nJACK (CONT'D) shit. The flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a fuse, back towards the bar. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 52. Almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look, the flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the puddles of gas. They all watch in horror as the fire ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar, then the roof ... \nEXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - SAME TIME \n", "test1_id": 705, "test2_input": "(MOUTH FULL) I did. \nDOUG I hope you choke on it. CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins - identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good. \nCHARLEY Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party! These are my deputies: Earl and Buck Dooble. Earl shakes the guys hands. \nEARL I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember, the brother with the word \"ear,\" in his name, has both on his head. \n(LAUGHS) I can only say that because I'm on his right side. Which as you can see, is blown off. Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious. \nBUCK I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck telling us apart! Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing ear to the guys. They draw back a little. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 71. \nDOUG Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've got a great town here. \nCHARLEY Yeah, we got everything here. Good people, good fishing... \nEARL We do have convicted child molesters, though. We have to disclose that. \nCHARLEY Not if they don't have kids, Earl. \nEARL Just to be safe, though. (yells at crowd of people) Hey!! Thomas Milborn! A bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks. \nEARL (CONT'D) \n(ANNOUNCING) Convicted child molester. Thomas Milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his pockets. The guys look at each other uneasily. \nBOB Well... Still a nice town. \nWOODY If you're not a kid. \nDOUG Or Thomas Milborn. \nANGLE ON: DANCE FLOOR AREA: DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of Usher's \"Yeah.\" Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and shakes his head to the music. Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 72. ANGLE ON: The Wild Hog's table. The guys sit with Charley, Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious look. \nCHARLEY Looks like your friend and Maggie are hitting it off. \nDOUG Yeah. I think he really likes that girl. \nCHARLEY Well, Maggie's a great woman. \nEARL Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but you know... He's a deformed freak. Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley, deaf to the conversation. \nBUCK I used to like that girl... but then I realized, I can do better. The guys look at Buck. \nCHARLEY So, why are you guys taking this road trip, anyway? \nDOUG Ahh, just to escape for a bit. \nWOODY Hey, we're not escaping anything, man. We're on this trip to live. \nCHARLEY I know what you mean. Sometimes things in life can bother you, and sometimes nothing in life can bother you. Either way, you've got take a break from it. Happiness is somewhere between boredom and stress. Doug is surprised at Charley's insight. So is Woody. \nWOODY Exactly. Which is why we need to keep riding until we figure out where that happiness is. You don't get old Doug back by just staying put. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 73. \nCHARLEY Old Doug? \nDOUG Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't sing Bon Jovi anymore. \nWOODY You did lose him, Doug. You know why? You're housebroken. You're too comfortable. You've got to snap out of it! Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right. \nCHARLEY \n(TO DOUG) Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable can be a bad thing. You have to wake up and slap the bull once in a while. \nWOODY Right! Slap the bull! (then, to Charley) What? \nCHARLEY Slapping the bull is kind of the local test of manhood. It's a way to prove you aren't controlled by fear. We've all done it. \nEARL Yup. Even torn-open head, here. He nods at Buck, on his left. \n", "test2_true": "WOODY We're slapping the bull. \nDOUG I don't think we need to. I mean, we can have our own test of manhood. Let's see how many ears of corn we can eat or something. I'll start. Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody just grins with that reckless look in his eyes. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 74. \nWOODY We are slapping the bull. Doug knows it's no use. He nods, defeated. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COW PASTURE - THAT EVENING \nDOUG, BOB, WOODY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL approach a fence surrounding a pasture. Charley smiles. \nCHARLEY Here we are. The Lucas test of manhood. Slap the bull. Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture. He's a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns. \nWOODY Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull? \nEARL Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail it out of there, because he can kill ya. \nDOUG Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea, so... go ahead. Woody nods. \nWOODY All right. I'm going in. \nDOUG / BOB You are? \nWOODY Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out of that bull. Like, pimp-style. The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed. Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard on the ass. The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with an exhilarated look on his face. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 75. \nWOODY (CONT'D) Whhhheeeeeeew! Woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over. The guys all applaud. \nWOODY (CONT'D) Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just slapped a big fat bull right on his ass! Did you hear how pissed he was!? I just pissed of a bull! (back to Bull) Bitch! Woody high fives all the guys. \nDOUG All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that bull. The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the fence, watching. \nWOODY \n(TO CHARLEY) Thanks for bringing us out here. Doug really needs this. \nBOB Yeah. This is good for him. \nCHARLEY Sure. Glad we could help. \nBUCK Yeah, and we've never seen it done twice in a row. It'll be interesting to see how the bull takes being slapped now that he's alert. \nWOODY / BOB Alert? Woody and Bob look at each other, then to the Bull - which Doug is about to slap. \nWOODY Doug, wait! It's too late. Doug slaps the bull hard, and turns to run. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 76. \nDOUG Wheeeeew!! Yeah! Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into an angry charge towards Doug. The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to terror. \nDOUG (CONT'D) Ahhhhhhhh! It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and starts lining up another charge at him. \nWOODY Oh, no you don't! Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field. \nWOODY (CONT'D) Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull! The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him. \nWOODY (CONT'D) Run, Doug! Go! Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody. Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again. The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air. Woody lands hard, with a grunt. The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob jumps over the fence. \nBOB Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of this!? Come get this! Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes flying past him. \nBOB (CONT'D) Hah! Missed me, you fat bastard! \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 77. Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry towards the fence. Charley and Buck hold a gate open for them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up, but they've already made it to the gate. They go through and Charley shuts it behind them. They lean back on the fence, trying to gather their bearings, except Bob - who is thrilled. \nBOB (CONT'D) Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged that stupid cow! How cool am-- Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious. \nBOB (CONT'D) You son of a bitch! You want to keep it going!? You want to take cheap shots!? Come on! Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys restrain him. \nBOB (CONT'D) \n", "test2_id": 706, "test3_input": "DOUG What do you mean? Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 90. \nBUD It's the funny thing about life. It has to be an adventure to feel right. But when you become a husband and a Dad, you realize adventure is risk, and a family man has no place in his life for risk. Doug takes this in, then realizes. \nDOUG You're right. That's why I stopped singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a risk. That was old Doug. And now it's gone. I've taken away all the risk. \nBUD Yup. And if you try to make livin' too safe, then it's not livin' at all. \nDOUG It's not. And I have a will, now. So, I only have so much livin' left. And somehow I've lost the best part of it. \nBUD Well, maybe these will help you find it. Bud puts a styrofoam container on Doug's lap. Doug looks into it. \nDOUG These are worms. \nBUD Yup. To fish with. \nDOUG I don't get it. \nBUD Friends that screw up. Angry bikers. That's not something you should be avoiding. That's something you need. Doug takes this in. \nDOUG What's that have to do with worms? \nBUD Go down to the lake and find out. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 91. Bud smiles and walks off. Doug looks down at the worms, considering... \nEXT. LAKE - LATER \nDoug walks up to the shore and sees Woody, trying to push a canoe towards the water. Woody notices Doug. \nWOODY Hey. \nDOUG Hey. Going fishing? \nWOODY Yup. Woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at Doug. \nDOUG I've got worms. \n(BEAT) I mean, in here. Doug holds up the styrofoam cup. Woody shrugs. \nWOODY All right. Let's go. Doug helps Woody shove the boat out into the water. They both hop in as it floats away from the shore. They sit there staring off in silence. \nDOUG Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about Claudia. And the job. \nWOODY \n(STARING OFF) Thanks. \nDOUG But, you shouldn't have lied to us-- \nWOODY You know what? I screwed up! It happens. Maybe from now on I'm better off just doing things on my own! Woody starts to get up, but then looks at the water around him, and sits. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 92. \nDOUG You would have stormed off right then, huh? \nWOODY \n(DEFLATED) Yeah. Doug nods and looks out at the water. They sit there in silence for another moment. \nWOODY (CONT'D) I didn't want to lose, Doug. I've lost everything else and I didn't want to lose this trip with you guys. When we're together, it's like we're all college kids still. I'm not a guy with a broken marriage and failed career. I'm just with my best friends, being happy. And to keep it going, I forgot about what made it so great... That friends never let each other down. Until now. I screwed up the last thing I had left. You guys deserve better. I'm sorry-- Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from Doug. They sit there for another moment. \nDOUG Well, what's the point of being in a motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in a little trouble? Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit. \nDOUG (CONT'D) It'll be okay, man. Woody smiles a little as well. \nWOODY They won't kill us, right? Just a... really bad beating. \nDOUG Yeah. We won't die. I don't think. \nWOODY No way. And how much could a punch really hurt? Not much, probably. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 93. \n", "test3_true": "WOODY Let's go find the Bob and Dudley. Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle. \nDOUG Did you bring the paddles? \nWOODY No. I wasn't even going to take this thing out, but I didn't want you to think I was just standing at the lake waiting for you. \nDOUG Why were you here? \nWOODY Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait for you. Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a styrofoam cup. \nBOB Hey, guys. \nDOUG Hey, Bob. Worms? Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods. \nBOB Are we all good? \nWOODY Yeah, Bob. We're all good. Woody smiles at Doug. \nDOUG \n(TO BOB) Throw us that paddle. Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the canoe, but it lands ten yards short and sinks. \nBOB Shit. Hold on. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 94. Bob grabs another paddle and throws it. This time it lands even shorter. Bob looks around for another paddle. \nDOUG Were those the only two paddles? \nBOB \n(BUMMED) Yeah. \nDOUG Oh. Bob sits down on the grass. \nBOB You guys'll drift in. \nDOUG \n(BUMMED) Yeah. Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still as glass. They sit there awkwardly as Bob waits on shore. \nINT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nA cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making something in a big pot, as a crowd of townspeople eat in the kitchen and dining room. MAGGIE and DUDLEY cross through the kitchen, and out to the front porch. \nEXT.

You were just out to have a good vacation. Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely. \nDUDLEY This has been the best vacation of my life. I met you. Maggie blushes. \nMAGGIE You bikers probably tell all the girls that. This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled. \nDUDLEY Maggie, I have to tell you something. I'm not really a cool biker or a cool... anything. I'm a computer programmer. A nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She watches me sleep and I don't know why. I think she's waiting for me to stop breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm not. Maggie takes this in.

Your cat is crazy if it doesn't like you as much as I do. Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Well, I better get back inside. I've got to set some chairs up in the family room for the lunch rush. People gotta eat. \n\"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 96. Maggie smiles and heads inside.

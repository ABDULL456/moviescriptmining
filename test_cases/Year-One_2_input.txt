OH That's so-- unselfish of you. 
HIGH PRIEST Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely. Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being. 
(COY) Here's a riddle: what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub? (pointing thumbs at 
HIMSELF) This-guy. Ohquickly changes the subject. 
OH So where does that hall lead to? 
HIGH PRIEST (his eyes light up) Come, I'll show you. He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols. HIGH PRIEST                                                     (cont'd) Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies-- the earthly domain of the

Official White HIGH PRIEST                           (cont'd) Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred, so powerful, that to enter is instant death for any mortal. 
OH Wow. (a long beat) So who cleans it? 
HIGH PRIEST it needs no cleaning. 
OH No, of course not. (can't let go of it) Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out? 
HIGH PRIEST (starting to get annoyed) I assume they finished it, then the Gods descended. 
OH Yeah, that's probably it. (another long beat) So you're saying we can't go in? 
HIGH PRIEST I just told you! To enter is instant death! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings. 
OH 
(QUICKLY) Right, right, right. 
(BEAT) What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in? 
HIGH PRIEST Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought it up. Let's go. (pushes Oh along) Move. Move. He shoos him down the hall.

Zed and Princess Inanna stealthily enter the temple. 
ZED (looking around nervously) What are we doing here? 
INANNA I want you to enter the Holy of Holies. 
ZED Yes! Finally. Now you're talking! Should I enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--? 
INANNA 
(POINTS) That's the Holy of Holies-- you have to go in there and talk to the Gods. 
ZED The Gods are in there? 
INANNA So they say, but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest. They say it's instant death for anyone else to enter. 
ZED Then why am I going in? 
INANNA 
(IMPATIENT) Because you were chosen? If the Gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already. 
ZED 
RIGHT-- 
INANNA This is what you've been chosen for! To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city. Then come back out and tell me what it's like inside.

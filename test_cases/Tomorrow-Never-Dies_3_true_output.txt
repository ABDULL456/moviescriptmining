It looks just like the jet fighter videos from the Gulf War. 
INT. GARAGE - SECOND TURN - UP RAMP - 
Bond's car roars around a second turn, with sparks flying as it scrapes the walls. AHEAD, a MASSIVE ONE-PIECE DOOR is FOLDING DOWN FROM THE CEILING. A city street beyond. 
INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - 
SIDNEY We're not going to make it! 
Bond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY begins to run through a set of numbers. Bond explains: 
BOND If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code. 
SIDNEY If not? 
BOND (pointing to a button) We blast through. 
THE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED - 
BOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. HE PUNCHES THE MISSILE BUTTON. 
TWO MISSILES ROAR OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR - 
THEY EXPLODE AGAINST THE CLOSING DOOR - TO NO EFFECT. 
BOND'S CAR GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER - 
SIDNEY SCREAMS! BOND BRACES, AND - 
BOOM! CRASH! SILENCE. BLACK. After a moment, we HEAR THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON CEMENT. 
INT. GARAGE - 
The lights come on. The car is a twisted wreck, smashed against the wall. Bond and Sidney are slumped forward, unconscious. 
Harmsway KNOCKS TWICE ON THE GARAGE DOOR, to demonstrate: 
HARMSWAY - Built to withstand a nuclear blast. (to Stamper, checking Bond's pulse) Are they alive? 
STAMPER Yes. Shall we kill them? 
HARMSWAY No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan. (beat) Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING - 
It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk; where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones. 
At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS: 
THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. 
Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to: 
THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR - 
With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner. 
ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (VO) As part of our continuing report on terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant... 
NEW ANGLE (EXT. POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) - 
Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the "over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT. 
(There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.) 
ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd) - Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior engineer in charge of security. (beat) Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this plant from a terrorist attack? 
He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin. 
CHIN Totally secure. Without codes, you'd need a missile to blast through the front door; you normally can't even get this close (to the plant) without a full security clearance. 
ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER ...Could you say that a little closer to the microphone? 
He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face: 
CHIN Of course. You'd need - 
Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG. 
YUNG (to the guards) Now! 
At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR. 
BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both. 
YUNG Let's go! 
As Yung and the cameramen rush forward - 
ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT - 
Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck: 
HARMSWAY Get the machine in the water! 
They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold. (This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top, and no flexible tubing attached.) 
INT. HALLWAY/RECEPTION - POWER PLANT - 
Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area: 
POWER PLANT GUARD What happened out there? 
YUNG A generator blew. Nothing to worry about. (beat) But I need one last shot of you. Why don't you stand by the alarm? 
POWER PLANT GUARD No problem. 
The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera... And Yung pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him. 
YUNG (to the cameramen) Up the stairs! 
They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control room. Meanwhile, back at the HNN boat: 
INT. CABIN - HNN BOAT 
Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way out. He hears the door click open, and - 
A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on top. Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney. 
STAMPER Put on your clothes. (to the guard) Cuff him. 
The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to: 
INT. POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM - 
Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con- soles, with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE, and its surrounding blue COOLING POOL.

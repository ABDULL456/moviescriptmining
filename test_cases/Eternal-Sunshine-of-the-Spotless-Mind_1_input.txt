JOEL (CONT'D) I don't think your personality comes out of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a pretty topping. 
She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's surprised and pleased and nervous. 
JOEL (CONT'D) (shyly formal) So, I enjoyed meeting you. 
CLEMENTINE You'll call me, right? 
JOEL Yeah. 
CLEMENTINE When? 
JOEL Tomorrow? 
CLEMENTINE Tonight.  Just to test out the phone lines and all. 
JOEL Okay. 
We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car. 
INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT 
Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented. 
SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER 
He arrives at his apartment building and parks. 
EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street.  There are two dark figures inside. 
VOICE-OVER Them. 
He hurries inside the building. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight. 
JOEL It was snowing. 
VOICE-OVER There are two of them.  Couldn't make them out.  The orange glow of a cigarette. 
Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel. 
JOEL The driver waved.  So casual, friendly. 
VOICE-OVER I'm like a joke to them. 
Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched. 
VOICE-OVER I guess they figure they can act like they want.  They don't have to worry about me remembering. 
He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out. 
JOEL I might be making a mistake. 
VOICE-OVER Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just need to learn to live with this.  First of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it happened.  Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it.  Who said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure. But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her. 
JOEL Fuck you, Clementine. 
The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague. Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it. It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it. 
JOEL (CONT'D) Pink. (beat) There was a number on it.  I remember. AL 1718? (beat) I have to follow through with this.  I have no choice. 
VOICE-OVER The pill was pink, I remember.  It had some letters and numbers on it.  What were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four digits.  I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are.  I have no choice. 
He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone. 
JOEL (CONT'D) We're sorry, the number you have dialed... (beat) Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ... 
RECORDED VOICE We're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service.  If you think you have reached this recording in error 
JOEL (CONT'D) Bye. 
Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment building door open.  He hears footsteps. 
JOEL (CONT'D) It's them. 
VOICE-OVER It's too late. 
His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes. 
BLACK. 
He hears a key in his apartment door.

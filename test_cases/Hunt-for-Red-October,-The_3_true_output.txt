IN THE ENLISTED MESS crowded together at tables, men hear Ramius' voice: 
RAMIUS (VO CONT'D) 
(ON SPEAKERS) We are to pass quiet as water through every one of the American's sonar nets. Maintaining strict radio. silence, we are to proceed across the Atlantic to the east coast of the United States. 
IN ENGINEERING beneath a maze of pipes, technicians listen: 
RAMIUS (VO CONT'D) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Once in the home waters of the enemy, we are to conduct a series of ine firing tests, targeting major cities on the enemy's eastern seaboard. 
IN THE MISSILE BAYS 
S men are spellbound by their captain's intensity: 
RAMIUS (VO -CONT'D) 
(ON SPEAKERS) For many years, we have had to stand helplessly in the wings while poll ns compromise every advance our military has made. 
BACK IN THE CONN Ramius stands on the periscope platform holding the phone. All eyes are riveted on him : 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) it is politicians who have crippled our armed forces while talking incessantly of peace. And now it is time, comrades, to exchange the cuckoo for a hawk. 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Our missies will not be armed, of course, but imagine, if they were. In one bright moment, all that we believe in, all that we honor, would prevail forever. Ramius is finished. No one moves. Kamarov has goose bumps. 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) Comrade, navigator. 
KAMAROV Captain? 
RAMIUS Rig for silent running. 
KAMAROV

IN THE CONN Ramius and his men hear the dark RING of STEEL on STEEL in deep 
WATER: 
KAMAROV Outer doors are open, Captain. 
RAMIUS Engage the caterpi lar. 
OUTSIDE RED OCTOBER in the water...: An eerie green ring of light starts to glow in the tunnel behind thedoors. A second light appears. Then a third, flashing florescent. Behind the tunnel, in the stern, Red October's giant propeller comes to a stop. Suddenly, more light appears, distorted by a sudden rush of water. 
CUT-- TO: 
JONES in the Dalla' sonar shack, working his computer. The COB is behind him, Beaumont to his left. Red October's AMPISFIED HISS f Ms the room. Suddenly, 
THE HISS STOPS Jones frowns. The blinking light on his sonar display disappears. Curious, the COB leans over Jones, studying the screen: 
COB What happened? 
JONES Don't know. 
COB What do you mean, don't know? 
CUT TO: 
RAMIUS on the deck by the phone in Red October's Conn. Conscious of all eyes on him, he turns to a HELMSMAN: 
RAMIUS Left full rudder. 
HELMSMAN Rudder is left fuB.. 
RAMIUS Navigator, make your new course two-five-zero. 
KAMAROV Coming to course two-five-zero. Kama=ov draws a line on his chart. The new course is west into the Atlantic. Suddenly, the intercom CRACKLES:

INDIANA Hasn't the Pankot palace been de- serted since the Mutiny of 1857? 
SHAMAN (darkly) No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again. 
The shaman looks around at his unfortunate people. 
SHAMAN (Cont'd) It is Pankot Palace that kills my village. 
INDIANA I don't understand.  What's hap- pened here? 
SHAMAN The evil starts in Pankot.  Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country. 
INDIANA What evil? 
SHAMAN They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village. 
Willie looks over at Indiana -- 
WILLIE Took what? 
INDIANA It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village. 
SHAMAN It is why Krishna brought you here. 
INDIANA (politely firm) Nobody brought us here.  Our plane crashed.  We were shot down by -- 
SHAMAN (interrupting) No.  We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone.  It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva- linga -- and bring back to us. 
Indy's about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain, the elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly.  And he sees again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman. 
CUT TO: 
40.    EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 40. 
Torches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany the shaman, elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark village.  Short Round walks beside Indy. 
SHORT ROUND Indy, they make out plane crash? To get you here? 
INDIANA It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story. 
Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking.  The shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of rocks to illuminate them.  The shaman makes a gesture of devotion to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village chieftain. 
CHIEFTAIN Yes. 
Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine.  On top of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche.  The niche is empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone that was stolen. 
INDIANA Was the stone very smooth? (he sees the chieftain nod) It was probably brought here from a sacred river. 
SHAMAN (joining Indy and the chieftain) Long ago -- before my father's father. 
INDIANA And it had three lines painted across it? (seeing the shaman nod) The lines represent the three levels of the universe.  I've seen stones like the one you lost. 
Indy stands slowly.  Willie is beside him looking at the shrine. 
WILLIE I don't understand how losing one rock could destroy this village. (whispering to Indy) Is it really powerful? 
Indy gives a doubtful smile.  He turns again to the old shaman. 
INDIANA But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone? 
SHAMAN They say we must pray to their evil god.  We say we will not. 
The old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he starts speaking in Hindi. 
INDIANA (translating) He says that when the sacred stone was taken the village wells dried up first and then the river stopped. 
Indy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi.  The shaman answers in Hindi. 
INDIANA (translating) He says their crops dies and then the animals died. 
The shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out into the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in Hindi -- 
INDIANA (translating) And then they took their children. 
WILLIE Their children? 
She looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful faces always watching him.  Indy asks another question in Hindi and the shaman continues his story -- 
INDIANA (translating) He says one night there was a fire in the fields.  The men went to fight it.  When they came back, they heard the women crying in the darkness.  And the children were gone. 
The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana. 
SHAMAN You will find them when you find sivlalinga. 
INDIANA I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. 
The shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana, refusing to accept that. 
INDIANA (Cont'd) The English authorities who con- trol this area are the only ones who can help you. 
CHIEFTAIN They do not listen. 
INDIANA I have friends in Delhi and I will make sure they investigate this...

HARRY Dammit! Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus-- HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him. TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood-- 
INT. RSR CAPITAL -- CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING 
A big corner office. The phone rings. Charlie picks up. 
DAVID (TEL. V.O.) Guess who I just sat down next to on the bus? 
INTERCUTTING WITH CHARLIE 
CHARLIE Who? 
DAVID The woman from election night. 
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING 
A dazed Harry lies in the road... The taxi driver who hit him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay... 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
CHARLIE (TEL. V.O.) The one you kissed? 
DAVID She kissed me. I just didn't fight it. 
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING 
Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front tire. 
INT. BUS -- MORNING 
CHARLIE (O.S.) You're shitting me. Just randomly you sit down next to-- He's cut off mid-word. 
DAVID Charlie? David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David hits redial. Gets a fast busy. 
DAVID ' (to himself). This is ridiculous. He pockets his phone. 
EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH MORNING 
The taxi driver is with Harry now. 
TAXI DRIVER Are you okay? Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently for something. 
HARRY I'm fine-- Will you hand me that? Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK." 
TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D) Are you sure you're okay? The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram: Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese. And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page. 
HARRY Oh...shit... 
EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING 
David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office tower. He enters through the revolving door-- 
INT. DAVID'S OFFICE BUILDING'-- GROUND FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING 
Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other end of the lobby. David gets into an empty elevator. 
INT. 41ST FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING 
David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He waves as-he:passes by. No wade back. She must not see him. 
DAVID Okay... Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself. 
INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING 
David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul in sight. Not a single secretary is here. 
DAVID (loud, playful) Doesn't anybody bother getting in before eight at this place? David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling. 
DAVID (CONT'D) 
(EXUBERANT) Susan! How are you today? (when she doesn't move) Susan? David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Susan? He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead still. David rushes through Charlie's door: 
DAVID Call 911! Something's wrong with Susan! 
INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING 
--and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum. He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear). One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached to the left side.of Charlie's skull.

FRED No, no, the rest --! 
BARNEY Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred? 
Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink.    Fred groans. HERDMASTER Thank you, Brother Rubble. The Buffaloes will now have their secret vote. (a command) Fit... furs! 
(CONTINUED) 
127   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              127 Everyone pulls their horned fezzes down over their eyes. 
HERDMASTER Paw... ground! Everyone does a bull-like stomp and scrape. 
HERDMASTER All for Piltdown, bellow now! The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS. 
HERDMASTER All for Flintstone, bellow now! 
Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull. Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around" desperately, hoping to hear one more snort. He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort... ... from Barney, of course. HERDMASTER Order furs! The fezzes come up. HERDMASTER The snorts have it! Brother Piltdown, it is my privilege to install you as the new Exalted Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big Buck of our Lodge. If you'll come forward, I will present you with the tokens of office. Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium. 
128   FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY                                       128 Fred's a broken man.       Barney moves over, puts his arm around him. 
BARNEY I voted for you, Fred. FRED Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...! Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it. 
129   WIDER                                                      129 Piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon, smiles at the group. 
PILTDOWN Thank you, Brother Chairman. Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few words. It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101... which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So my agenda for tonight... ends right now. There's a time to be a Buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep... All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back. PILTDOWN ... and there's a time to stand up and be a man! So let's go down there and make the Slate shop into slate scrap... then we'll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of Neolithic 101! Meeting adjourned! 
With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up. Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are slapped on. The Buffalo run out. When the dust clears, we see that only one member has avoided the herding instinct: Barney. Now, he turns, runs into -- 
130   BUFFALO LODGE - RECREATION AREA - NIGHT                    130 Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he sees -- 131   PICTURE                                                    131 
Even his childhood shot has been defaced. 132   BACK TO SCENE                                              132 
He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders. (CONTINUED) 
132   CONTINUED:                                                    132 BARNEY Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- ! FRED No kidding. They rejected the best candidate -- 
BARNEY No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line! 
FRED (genuinely worried) Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! (pause) We could end up with half a percent of nothing! BARNEY No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail! FRED Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em! CUT TO: 133   EXT. SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT                                     133 Silent, empty. CAMERA PANS FROM the still yard TO the gate. Down the road, we see Piltdown leading the angry mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it! PILTDOWN Okay! Let's start with Slate's golf trophies and work our way up to the assembly line! AD LIB angry cheers, and the mob storms into the plant, knocking aside equipment and supplies.

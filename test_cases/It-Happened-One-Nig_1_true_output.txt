(arguing with himself) 
You're forgetting you're married. 
ELLIE 
(tensely) 
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself. 
(begging) 
Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you. 
(in a choked voice) 
Oh, Peter 
Sobbing, she lays her head on his breast and throws her arms around him. All is quiet for a moment as Ellie's head rests on his breast, while Peter struggles with an overwhelming urge to pour out his heart to her. 
PETER 
(scarcely audible) 
Better go back to your bed. 
There is a lengthy pause, neither of them stirs. Then Ellie slowly raises her tear-stained face and gets to her feet. 
ELLIE 
(whispering) 
I'm sorry. 
She turns and disappears behind the blanket. Peter remains motionless. Then a close view shows Ellie, as she gets into bed, sobbing quietly. She hides her face in the pillow to suppress her sobs. It is the first time in her life that she has been so deeply hurt. A close view next shows Peter reaching over for a cigarette, which he lights. All his movements are thoughtful, meditative. He leans back and stares at the ceiling, until we see only the cigarette in his mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke. This dissolving, the cigarette is seen to be burnt three quarters down, a long, frail ash hanging perilously on. Peter is then seen as he removes the cigarette from his mouth and crushes it in a tray. He leans back on the pillow and for a moment he is quiet. Then glancing over in Ellie's direction, he calls to her: 
PETER 
(softly calling) 
Hey, Brat! 
(a pause) 
Did you mean that? Would you really go? 
(he waits for a response, but none comes. He tries again) 
Hey, Brat 
He listensall is quiet. He slips his covers off and crosses to the blanket, and peers over it. She is asleep. Her tear-stained face rests on the pillow, her arm extends over her head. It is a childlike posture. 
PETER is watching her tenderly. He speculates whether to awaken her and decides against it. He starts away. Peter tiptoes around the room for a few moments, deep in thought. Then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind begins to take form, he hastily begins dressing. 
The scene dissolving, Peter is seen completely clothed and starting for the door when he thinks of something. He turns back, grabs his suitcase, stops to throw a kiss to Ellie, and goes out into the night. Thereupon the scene wipes off, disclosing a Gas Station along the road at night. Here Peter is talking to a station attendant. 
PETER 
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars. 
MAN 
(hesitatingly) 
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas. 
PETER 
("high-pressuring" him) 
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say? 
MAN 
(looking at Peter's hat) 
I ain't got a hat 
PETER 
What? 
MAN 
I ain't got a hat. 
PETER 
(promptly putting it on his head) 
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up. 
While he is still talking the scene dissolves to a view of Peter driving furiously, a broad, happy grin on his face, following which several scenes wipe off in succession (denoting the passage of time) scenes of Peter driving at high speed, causing several cows to amble out of the way; of the CAR driving into the Holland Tunnel, and of the BACK ROOM of a SPEAKEASY where Peter stands in 
front of a small desk upon which there is a typewriter. Near him is a swarthy Italian. 
PETER 
Fine! That's fine, Tony. Now get me a drink and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour. 
ITALIAN 
(going out) 
Sure. Sure, Pete. 
As Peter plants himself in front of the machine, the scene dissolves to a close-up of the typewriter carriage upon which are typed the words: 
"and that's the full and exclusive story of Ellen Andrews' adventures on the road. As soon as her marriage to King Westley is annulled, she and Peter Warne, famous newspapermanand undoubtedly the most promising young novelist of the present erawill be married." 
The view drawing back, Peter re-reads the last sentence, smiles contentedly, and as he yanks out the sheet, the scene wipes off disclosing the outside of GORDON'S OFFICE, the sign on the door reading: "OfficeMr. Gordon." Gordon's secretary is at her desk as Peter breezes in. 
PETER 
(rumpling her hair) 
Hello, Agnes. 
AGNES 
Better not go in. He'll shoot you on sight. 
PETER 
(entering) 
I haven't been shot at for days. 
In GORDON'S OFFICE, Gordon is at his desk. He looks up when Peter enters. 
GORDON 
(rising to his full height menacingly) 
Get out of here! 
PETER 
(advancing) 
Wait a minute, GordonI 
GORDON 
(quietly) 
Get out! 
Peter reaches his side, and grabs him by the arms. 
PETER 
Joe, listen 
GORDON 
Don't "Joe" me. 
PETER 
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe. 
GORDON 
You mean about the Andrews' kid? 
PETER 
That's it. 
(tapping his pocket) 
I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars. 
Upon hearing this GORDON is ready to jump out of his skin. 
GORDON 
A thousand dollars! 
(furiously) 
Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily. 
PETER 
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam. 
GORDON

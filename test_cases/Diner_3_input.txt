CONTINLED : 
_ _ _ _ BETH She thinks that since he never talked it over with Billy beforehand, it kind of bothers him even more. 
SHREVIE The closest of the close. You t-_.ow Billy's flying in this morning? 
BETH I didn't hear about it. Thought he was just coming in for the wedding day. 
SHREVIE We didn't want to mention it. Surprise for Eddie. Shrevie's car follows in the taillights of Boogie's car. Fenwick's car is nowhere in sight. 
BETH Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie. They picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding. You know, like we did, tablecloth, napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway, Eddie objected. He wanted blue and white because that's The Colts' colors. Refused to give in. 
SHREV7E Yeah, so? 
BETD Well, you know how stubborn Eddie is . 
SHP_-VIE Could be worse. It could be black and gold. Steelers' colors. Shrevie notices Boogie's taillights come or.. He slows down. Something is wrong up ahead. f EXT. ?.CADSIDE - NIGHT Fenwick's car is turned over. The headlights of the car shine brightly against a tree.

He stares at her. 
MALCOLM Nothing! 
CLOSE - COED 
She is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears. 
161 	INT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - DAY 
Speaking to a packed STUDENT AUDIENCE. 
MALCOLM ...My high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, and I took my masters in prison. If you look out the window-- 
161A 	SHOT MALCOLM'S OLD GANG HANGOUT 
MALCOLM'S VOICE --you can see my burglary hangout. I lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead. 
ANGLE - The audience carefully listening. 
MALCOLM Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, so God will be on our side to help us fight our battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and committing adultery. When we get off the welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need for your family, then your family respects you. They'll be proud to say "That's my father." She's proud to say "That's my husband..." Father means you're taking care of those children. Just 'cause you made them that don't mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can go and get a woman but anybody can't take care of a woman. This is the type of teaching that the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people. 
SHOT OF REPORTERS IN AUDIENCE 
Beginning to scribble furiously. 
MALCOLM I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz if I said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary. 
Loud laughter from the audience. But this response is overwhelmed by the response of ANOTHER, LARGER AUDIENCE. 
162	INT. MONSTER RALLY - NIGHT 
Malcolm is talking before an all-black audience. It is the largest rally yet; the hall is packed to the rafters. 
MALCOLM We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 temples in fifty states. From a handful we have grown to scores of thousands. 
VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RALLY 
HAWKERS selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the podium; Lorraine, Sidney, Earl, Benjamin, and Bembry. For the first time a new note is seen in Bembry's face: reserve bordering on resentment. When others around him cheer Malcolm, Bembry is cool. Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment. 
MALCOLM/HIS VOICE The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God is now about to establish a kingdom on this earth based on brotherhood and 
against peace, his history on this earth has proved that. Nowhere in history has he been brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has been brotherly toward you is when he can use you, when he can exploit you, when he can oppress you, when you will submit to him. And since his own history makes him unqualified to be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God is about to eliminate that particular race from this earth. So since they are due for elimination, we don't want to be with them. 
ANGLE - CROWD 
CLOSE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM (contd) If the so-called Negro were American citizens we wouldn't have a race problem. If the Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These Negro leaders have been telling the white man everything is all right, everything is under control. And they've been telling the white man that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been saying is going to come to pass is now coming to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing up saying that we are about to have a racial explosion. We're going to have a racial explosion and that's more dangerous than an atomic explosion. 
ANGLE - MALCOLM 
MALCOLM (contd) It's going to explode because black people are dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only with the white man, but with these Negroes who have been sitting around here posing as leaders and spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing is going to explode and if the thing that explodes is still inside the house, then the house will be destroyed. So the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get this powder keg out of your house, let the black people in this country separate from him while there's still time. And if the black man is allowed to separate and go on onto some land of his own, where he can solve his problems, then there won't be any explosion. COMPLETE SEPARATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE BLACK AND WHITE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY!!! 
ANGLE - CROWD 
A wave of cheers as people explode. 
163	 INT. AN ANTEROOM OF THE RALLY - NIGHT 
The rally is over. A small room packed with PEOPLE congratulating Malcolm, trying to touch him. He is the hero of the hour. Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin with him, enjoying the accolades and trying to help Malcolm make his way out. Bembry stands apart, removed and silent. 
MALCOLM Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you? 
SIDNEY Please make way, please-- 
ANGLE. A WELL-KNOWN PERSONALITY (DICK GREGORY) is at the door. He and Malcolm know each other well. Malcolm extends a palm, but Gregory doesn't slap it. 
GREGORY Can I ask you something? 
MALCOLM Sure, man. 
GREGORY Are you Elijah's pimp? 
MALCOLM What? 
GREGORY (scornfully) "His greatest greatness." 
MALCOLM Say what you're saying. 
GREGORY If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you. 
164 	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT 
Betty, pregnant with child, is in a chair -- a newspaper in her lap. Malcolm is in the other room, putting his last daughter to sleep. We hear him... 
ANGLE - BEDROOM 
MALCOLM'S VOICE Okay, last hug. 
As he enters, a smile on his face, but the concern of the evening clearly imprinted. He sits down heavily. Betty watches him carefully. 
MALCOLM Long day. Long night. Long year. Long ten years. 
He smiles. She doesn't. 
MALCOLM (contd) Why are you looking at me like that? 
BETTY Because you're in trouble. 
MALCOLM How do you know? 
She smiles. 
BETTY Dear heart, because I know you. 
A pause. 
MALCOLM I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that. 
BETTY I'm not made of glass.

SPOCK PRIME Mutiny?   You are not the Captain? 
KIRK You're the captain.   Pike was taken hostage. 
SPOCK PRIME (realizing, grave) ... by Nero. 
KIRK What do you know about him? 
SPOCK PRIME (guilty, burdened) ... he is a remarkably... (MORE) 
161A CONTINUED:                                                   161A SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D) troubled Romulan. (then) ... Please. Allow me -- it will be easier-- 
Spock Prime reaches for Kirk's face -- Kirk grabs his wrist -- 
KIRK What're you doing--? 
A skeptical beat, but Kirk finally releases his hand. Spock gently places his fingers on Kirk's cheek and temple -- 
SPOCK PRIME (whispering; a mantra) Our minds... one and together...One hundred and twenty-seven years from now everything ends. 
Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge -- and the SCREEN OVEREXPOSES TO WHITE as we CUT TO our MIND MELD SEQUENCE: 
162   EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                               162 
A SUPERNOVA. An EXPLODING STAR, like a LIGHT, EATING AWAY AT ALL AROUND IT -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova -- and like a cancer left untreated... it will grow... and destroy everything. 
162A INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY                                     162A 
Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN, its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan Science Academy devised a plan to stop it. 
162B EXT. VULCAN SHIPYARD - NIGHT                                    162B 
PUSH IN as the JELLYFISH SHIP is under construction -- 
162B CONTINUED:                                                      162B 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) We built a ship containing a material capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a supernova. A black hole. 
163   INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD - NIGHT                        163 
Now we're INSIDE the ship -- the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- being ASSEMBLED by Vulcan Scientists -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I would not return. 
164   Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a Vulcan         164 Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) My sacrifice, in service of all races, seemed only logical. 
Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Unfortunately... before I could begin the mission... the supernova destroyed Romulus. 
165   OMIT                                                             165 
166   -- and suddenly we're OUT OF THE MIND MELD as KIRK GRABS SPOCK   166 PRIME'S HAND AGAIN: 
KIRK Nero's planet was destroyed-- 
SPOCK PRIME Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me continue. 
KIRK                           SPOCK PRIME This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain this--?                           -- allow me to finish. 
Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go: 
167   EXT. SPACE                                                     167 
-- the JELLYFISH SWOOPS PAST US -- and we PAN -- and see the MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the Jellyfish. 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) Nero came after me. Determined to thwart my mission. If Romulus was allowed to die, he said... all planets should share its fate. 
167A SPOCK PRIME IN THE COCKPIT, ROCKED AS TORPEDOES EXPLODE         167A CLOSELY. TIGHT ON SPOCK PRIME AS HIS MIND RACES -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) I needed an exit. I knew if this mission failed... everyone, everywhere... would lose everything. 
Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit -- 
167B INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD                               167B 
Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM THE HOLD -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) I realized: a large black hole could destroy the supernova. A smaller one... could be my escape. Could send me back in time, allowing me to complete my mission. So I created a black hole... 
Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into a JETTISON TUBE -- 
167C EXT. JELLYFISH - SPACE - NIGHT                                  167C 
-- and he FIRES THE CANNISTER INTO SPACE -- 
167D EXT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - NIGHT                                167D 
Spock Prime back in the cockpit -- takes aim on his controls and FIRES AT THE CANNISTER -- 
167E EXT. JELLYFISH/NARADA - SPACE - NIGHT                           167E 
A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED -- Spock Prime PILOTS TOWARD THE HOLE -- 
167E CONTINUED:                                                      167E 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) Nero must have understood what I was trying to do. Because he began racing for it. 
The NARADA and the JELLYFISH aiming for the BLACK HOLE -- 
167F OMIT                                                             167F 
167G INT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - NIGHT                                 167G

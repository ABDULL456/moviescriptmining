188   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNSET                                 188 
The blood red sun sets over the city. 
189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189 
Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack. 
The phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up. 
STEPHEN Our "Russians" have arrived. 
190   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                        190 
Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a red suitcase. 
190   CONTINUED:                                                 190 
BLOOM Who'd you get, anyway? 
STEPHEN Hm? 
BLOOM To play the "Russians?" 
DING. 
The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog. 
DIAMOND DOG My boys. 
191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191 
Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS, waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter. Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area. 
192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192 
BLOOM I don't understand. Tell me so I understand. Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard- 
STEPHEN We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book. The Dog's got his big store right here in St. Petersburg. 
BLOOM Alright, fuckin stop. You want this to finish in St. Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what thematic something? Fine but don't tell it like a story, let's say it. Twenty three years ago and I can still smell, that blood red apartment of his, the smell of that place. I hate him Stephen but this isn't that, this is I don't trust him. 
192   CONTINUED:                                                   192 
STEPHEN What's he gonna do? Steal our fake money? (beat) I've thought this one out, believe me. And we can't end it without him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok. 
193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193 
The red leather suitcase on the bar. 
DIAMOND DOG Stephen, still the grand architect with your symbols. Red for temptation, white for salvation. 
The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a loupe. 
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd) Impressive, boys. 
BLOOM It's trash. There's visible cross hatching in Franklin's eye. 
Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben Franklin's eye on the bills. 
DIAMOND DOG Hm.  I'll be damned. (closes case) Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead handing over a rag bag like this, it should be a steel attache. 
STEPHEN This'll   do. We'll do the drop off at your   store. Make it scary, think a   movie version of the Russian   mafia, but don't hassle her. 
DIAMOND DOG Alright. 
The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest on his bandaged hand. 
He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew. 
193   CONTINUED:                                                   193 
DIAMOND DOG (cont'd) I look forward to meeting the lady. Take care, boys. 
Leaving his gold lighter on the bar. 
194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194 
The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot. 
STEPHEN So. Our fake Russian attack. One small charge will simulate a bullet hit, and blow out the back window. 
The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on the rear windshield. 
STEPHEN (cont'd) So that one bang, then we roll off the road. Once we get clear of the car the Chink sets off the final charge, incinerating the car and the money in the trunk. This'll all happen exactly twenty seconds after we cross the main bridge out of town. After the bridge. 
Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his jacket. 
BLOOM Ok. 
195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195 
Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is expressionless. 
BLOOM You've been awful quiet. 
She doesn't react.

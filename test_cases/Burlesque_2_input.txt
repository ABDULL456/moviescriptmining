ALI (CONT'D) I may not have been to a professional dance school, but I have a lot of talent and I came to this town to do something with it. And the only reason I've been putting up with all the bullshit "attitude" I get from you is cause I want to do it here. 
(BEAT) For the first time in my life, I don't want to be someplace else. So you're gonna give me MY shot. Right here. Right now. Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess just looks at her, blinks, incredulous. 
ALI (CONT'D) One song. You don't like it, I'll quit and do us both a favor. 
(BEAT) Your call, lady. I know every number in the show. Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back 
AGAIN-- 
TESS 
(DOUBTFUL) You know every number. 
ALI Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her in disbelief. 
ALI (CONT'D) I said, which one do you wanna see? Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to DAVE in the sound booth-- 
TESS Tough Lover! Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly. ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality. After a few measures, Tess has seen enough. 
TESS (CONT'D) Okay then, next? 
ALI Hang on. (to Dave in the booth) Start it again, please? As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down and shakes it loose. Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage-- 
NIKKI 
(TO GEORGIA) What the hell's going on? 
COCO Shhhh. On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude. Then she looks up at the booth again. 
ALI Anytime. The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive. She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She misses a step or two, but who the hell cares? On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced. Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow. At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms - - unable to tear his eyes away. 
As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound is Ali's heavy breathing. Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY. 
NIKKI What are so you happy about, that's your replacement. 
GEORGIA Yeah, but she's really good. Tess and Ali are in a stare down. 
TESS I want so badly to say something bitchy, but nothing's coming. 
SEAN There's a first. Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props. 
TESS You were off the whole second half. 
ALI So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and RUNS to the bathroom to puke-- Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali. 
TESS Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in my ass. Ali tries hard not to beam-- 
ALI Do I have the job, or not? 
TESS You're not great. What you are is lucky. Because I need someone tonight. 
ALI And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves-- 
TESS Even in those shoes that time forgot. 
SEAN Theeeere's bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot. 
NIKKI Well-- this totally sucks ass. Sean jumps up on the stage. 
SEAN Congratulations. The last time someone showed Tess balls like that, she married him. (looks Ali over) You look like a checker at a Mal Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your salary. Get a new look. 
ALI Hey, I happen to like the way I look. 
SEAN Really? That's a fascinating story. And then what happens? 
(ALL BUSINESS) Backstage in five. 
(WALKING OFF) Welcome to the family. Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms around him. 
ALI Sorry for the short notice, I quit! (plants a big kiss on him) But hey-- with my raise I'll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him standing there, really turned on. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - DAY 
Sean swings open A DOOR, revealing a room packed to the gills with costumes: feathers, sequins, fishnets, corsets, jammed up against each other. Sean tosses her clothes in a blur. 
SEAN First number, second number, third number... She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them, holding them up as he tells her what they go with: 
SEAN (CONT'D) With the sequined bustier. With the shorts and garters. With the beaded number. And those -- (points to hers) I never want to see again. 
(REMEMBERING) Oh! And -- He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN. 
SEAN (CONT'D) For "Miss Otis Regrets". Just be sure you don't -- Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM -- GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean. 
SEAN (CONT'D) Pull the trigger. 
MUSIC UP: "RICH MAN'S FRUG". CARRY MUSIC OVER:

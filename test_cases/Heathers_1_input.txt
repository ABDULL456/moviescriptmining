HEATHER CHANDLER Corn nuts! 
INT.   7-11 
Stylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her. 
J.D. (O.S.) You going to pull a Big Gulp with that? 
VERONICA No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well. 
J.D. I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane. 
VERONICA Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe. 
J.D. The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee? 
VERONICA I didn't. Cherry. 
VERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile. 
7-11 PARKING LOT 
VERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle. 
VERONICA Great bike. 
HEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace. VERONICA glares at her then turns back to J.D. 
J.D. Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company? 
VERONICA I don't know. Should you? 
J.D. My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State." 
VERONICA Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place. 
J.D. Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect? 
VERONICA (gently joking) Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University. 
VERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again. 
VERONICA It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends. 
J.D. I don't really like your friends either. 
VERONICA It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit. 
J.D. Maybe it's time for a vacation. 
The car horn blares again. 
INT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT 
DAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door. 
The semi-handsome BRAD leans aainst a desk while a WHINING STUDENT talks with COED ONE who sits on the floor. 
DAVID Throw your coats on the bed, girls. 
WHINING STUDENT That exam was so bogus. 
COED ONE Oh I know. Which exam? 
DAVID Veronica, this is Brad. 
BRAD Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying slippers? 
HEATHER CHANDLER Yeah, let's party. 
DAVID She loves to party. 
As they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in BRAD'S FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh. 
INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT 
The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing monocled VERONICA writes at her desk. 
VERONICA (V.O.) Dear Diary, I want to kill and you have to believe.....damn pen! 
VERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to write. She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another. 
VERONICA (V.O.) You have to believe it's for more than selfish reasons. More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle. You have to believe me.

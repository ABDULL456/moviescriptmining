KOREAN MAN Stupy fucky boys! Fucky! 
He looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot that Casper previously stole from. 
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT - DAY 
Casper and Telly are walking down the street. Casper is eating a peach and drinking his 40oz. beer. Telly is also drinking. 
CASPER You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything. 
TELLY The cartoon? 
CASPER Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know. (mimics the cartoon) Activate in the form of, a glass of water. 
TELLY Yeah. 
CASPER Well, those guys share everything, right? 
TELLY Right. 
CASPER And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right? 
TELLY Right. 
CASPER And it got me thinkin. How fun it would be to share each other's girl. 
TELLY (laughing) Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring. 
CASPER No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"! 
The two of them start laughing and jumping on each other. Telly spits out a mouthful of beer. 
CASPER (laughing) Can you do it man? 
TELLY (laughing) Can I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire. 
Casper is jumping up and down on Telly's shoulder. 
CASPER Oh man. I fucking love this guy. 
The two of them walk off laughing. 
EXT. PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
A medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side. Cars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive by and beep their horns. 
Telly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings one of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with skateboarding stickers and "Legalize Marijuana" stickers. A Vespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the building, it also has stickers on it. 
Telly rings it again. It is a very hot day, both boys are wiping sweat from their bodies. 
PAUL (from box) Hello? 
TELLY It's me. Telly. 
PAUL (from box) Hello? 
TELLY (loudly) Paul it's Telly. Open up. 
A buzz is heard. 
There is a little girl sitting on the bottom step, playing with a doll. Casper runs down and gives her a peach. Then he runs back up. 
Telly and Casper enter the building. 
The little girl tosses the peach to the ground.

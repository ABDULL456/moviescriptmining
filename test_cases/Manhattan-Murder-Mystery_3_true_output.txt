LARRY You know, we could, we could do... (talking into the telephone) Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ? 
The camera pans back to Marcia, who listens to Larry, smoking her cigarette. 
LARRY (voice over) Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure. 
The camera pans back to Larry. 
LARRY I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on. 
He puts the telephone down on its hook. 
LARRY I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something. 
The camera pans back to Marcia, who is smiling. 
MARCIA Story of my life ! 
She crushes her cigarette in and ashtray and stands up. 
NEW-YORK - A PARK - EXTERIOR DAY 
Full shot of a round concrete pond, with a fountain in the middle pouring water. In the background, a meadow, with chairs scattered on it. Carol is standing by the pond. Larry is talking to her, looking very nervous. 
LARRY What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you nuts ? 
CAROL Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud. 
LARRY A fuddy-dud ? 
Carol starts walking around the pond. Larry follows her. 
CAROL Yeah. 
LARRY What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause. 
CAROL It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in. 
LARRY Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment. 
CAROL Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ? Okay ? 
LARRY I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory. 
CAROL He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. 
LARRY Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone. 
They keep on walking around the pond, the camera following them from a fixed location. They are now hidden by the fountain. 
CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) I told Ted. 
LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) You told Ted before you told me ? 
CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things. 
LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I don't break the law, you know ? 
CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah. 
LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull. 
CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ? 
They appear back from behind the fountain. 
LARRY I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me. 
CAROL He talked on the phone with a woman. 
LARRY How do you know ? CAROL Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so... 
LARRY He did ? 
CAROL Yeah, but I hid under the bed. 
LARRY You hid under his bed ? 
CAROL He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all. 
LARRY I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I... 
CAROL He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, «don't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together.» That kind of thing. 
They keep on walking around the pond, slowly coming back toward the camera, which moves a little to meet them. 
LARRY But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ? 
CAROL I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead. 
LARRY That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds. 
CAROL No, I c... 
LARRY He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What do you... 
CAROL Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss woman, right ? 
LARRY I don't wanna know. Leave me alone. 
CAROL And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says : «Tell her Tom called». You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry. 
They are back at the same place where we saw them first by the pond. They stop walking. LARRY Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I don't care. I don't wanna hear. 
CAROL Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did... 
LARRY I just don't... 
CAROL I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake. 
LARRY What ? 
CAROL I left my reading glasses on his table. 
Larry looks at her with a very puzzled eye. 
LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium close shot on Paul's apartment front door. We get a close shot of the back of Carol's head. The door opens on Paul. 
CAROL Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert. 
Carol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry. Paul looks a bit surprised by this intrusion. He follows them along the corridor. He doesn't even close his front door ! 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT The camera follows the three persons along the corridor. 
PAUL Well, thank you. 
CAROL I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh. 
The shot becoming a bit wider, we notice that Paul is carrying the tray of chocolate mousse that Carol gave him when entering his apartment. 
LARRY And you can divide it up and we can all have some. 
CAROL That'd be great. That's a great idea. LARRY You'll really like this dessert. 
PAUL Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute. 
Paul walks out of the corridor toward his kitchen, and Carol rushes into the living-room. 
CAROL Okay, that'd be really good.

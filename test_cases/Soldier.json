{"train": "SOLDIER \nWritten by \nDavid Webb Peoples \nREVISED DRAFT October 2, 1997 \nINT.  HOSPITAL NURSERY - NIGHT \nBABIES in bassinets, isolettes, incubators.  BABIES sleeping, BABIES blinking, BABIES cooing, BABIES chirping, BABIES squalling. \nIt's the SQUALLING BABIES, the ones with pinched faces and tiny bunched fists, that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in Military Uniforms.  (Their anonymity is assured by the angles from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are the backs of heads.) \nA lone NURSE watches them grimly as they make their \"selections,\" marking the cribs of the most active, noisy BABIES with X's. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  VAN/HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nANGLE ON VAN DOORS slamming shut on a dozen squalling BABIES in tiered red cribs. \nANGLE ON THE VAN pulling away from the loading dock of the large hospital as a date is SUPERED over the scene... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CAGE/BASEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT \nVicious teeth, savage snarls, tearing flesh as three fierce fighting DOGS battle a single WOLVERINE in large steel cage. \nThe cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in identical gray overalls.  As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle, amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears SUPERED over the scene... \nWE DISCOVER in the shadows more ANONYMOUS MEN (and WOMEN), some of them in Military Uniforms, observing the children. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  A WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT \nIt's creepy:  the same children two years older, milling about a bare cement room, apparently unsupervised.  They ought to look cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut hair.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene -- \n-- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him. \nIt's a harmless child's kick.  But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS, he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again.  And again. \nThe servo-motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall WHINES slightly as the camera pans to the record the action. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WINDOWLESS \"CLASSROOM\" - DAY OR NIGHT \nPuzzles.  Fingers fit shapes into holes.  The puzzles aren't fun puzzles; they're obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or both.  SIX-YEAR-OLDS now, the boys perform in a grim room under fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles, observing. \nAs a date appears SUPERED over this scene... \nWE NOTICE one of the SIX-YEAR-OLDS is becoming familiar to us. TODD.  We NOTICE his intense eyes as he dexterously manipulates a puzzle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FIELD - DAY \nBehind a cyclone fence topped with curlicues of razor wire, the boys, now TEN-YEAR-OLDS, are marching in formation under the supervision of a (faceless) DRILL SERGEANT.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  GYMNASIUM - DAY \nFourteen-year-old TODD is doing bench presses in shorts while all around him his FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD COMRADES work out with weights in a very grim and spartan gym that resembles a sinister concentration camp more than the yuppie spas of the 20th Century. The date appears SUPERED over the scene... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE/MONTAGE - DAY \nThe FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLDS, TODD among them, jump, roll, dive, crawl, swim, and rappel through a brutal course featuring: \nvertical wooden walls, \nfast moving rapids, \ntangles of barbed wire, \nsteep rock faces, \nand finally a jungle of dangling chains with tiny circular \"platforms\" about eight inches in diameter every ten feet. FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS bloody each other with pugil sticks and padded cudgels while they swing twenty feet above the ground.  One of them is knocked off, plummets downward.  CRUNCH! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SNOW COVERED LANDSCAPE - DAY \nLong even strides, two inches of snow.  Breathing hard, the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now lope through hills and woods in shorts and T-shirts, their breath coming in steamy blasts as the date is SUPERED over the scene... \nThis a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold weather, but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit, their faces hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes. \nExcept for the STRAGGLER, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear, obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling, struggling to keep his feet... \nANGLE ON A HILL where ANONYMOUS OBSERVERS, all in military dress, watch. \nANGLE ON THE STRAGGLER, unable to keep his feet, going down, gasping.  With fearful eyes, he looks toward the hill where he knows the OBSERVERS are. \nANGLE ON THE PACK, sixteen SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS not looking back, even as a single SHOT rings out.  TODD doesn't even blink, just keeps running. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - DAY \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a MILITARY FIGURE, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing. Before the weapon can flash a laser bean, AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages the target and it disappears back into the grass.  The boys, EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall grass. \nDifferent sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close, sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks. \nSuddenly a terrified MOTHER dashes along the street, a screaming BABY in her arms, looking for shelter. \nA CIVILIAN MAN pops out of a doorway, pulls her to safety. \nREVEAL TODD, watching from the shell of a once proud building. \nTODD'S POV of four ENEMY SOLDIERS running at a crouch among the rubble. \nANGLE ON TODD watching them scurry into a cellar door.  TODD turns and gives a hand signal. \nANGLE ON RILEY twenty yards away, hidden behind exposed machinery, acknowledging the signal and, along with a THIRD SOLDIER, advancing toward the cellar. \nEXT.  CELLAR DOOR \nTODD, RILEY, and the THIRD SOLDIER converge stealthily, coordinating with hand signals. \nTODD pulls the pin on a grenade, and RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER kick in the door. \nTODD tosses the grenade in as RILEY fires a withering barrage of automatic fire through the cellar door. \nBAHWHOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES. \nThen, RILEY, TODD and the THIRD SOLDIER charge in. \nINT.  CELLAR \nHEAVY FIRE as TODD, RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER spray the room. \nANGLE ON TODD signaling cease fire. \nSudden silence.  Drifting smoke.  Then...GROANS. \nFour ENEMY SOLDIERS are sprawled motionless, horribly eviscerated.  A fifth ENEMY SOLDIER, horribly wounded, is groaning. \nANGLE ON TODD surveying the scene, stone faced. \nTODD'S POV of the enemy dead, and several CIVILIANS equally dead, as well as the dead BODIES of several CHILDREN. \nBANG!  RILEY shoots the groaning ENEMY SOLDIER. \nSilence again. \nCLOSE ON TODD, his stone face.  What does he see?  What does he feel?  Anything?  A mystery! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BARRACKS - DAY \nA spartan room, bare bunk-beds.  Rain POUNDS on a window that looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the Third Dresden Moon. \nTODD is sitting on a bunk, shirtless.  His new rank has been tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  The names of various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an official record, not a decoration.  TODD is silent, staring into space.  The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts, fatigues, sleepwear.  WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE... \nThe WORDS FADE AWAY, the silence continues, the rain BEATS on the barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch the rain beat on the windowpane.  They look like robots...used robots, made individual only by their different scars. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BARRACKS - DAY \nRain.  Low buildings, boarded windows, slogans painted on the war- scarred walls, the makeshift barracks in one building, command quarters in the next. \nA lone figure, a MAN IN A PONCHO, hurries through the downpour, passing the barracks, heading for the command quarters. \nINT.  COMMAND QUARTERS \nEntering, the MAN shakes rain off his poncho.  His name is RUBRICK, he's thirty-five, a lieutenant.  He faces the two bored OFFICERS lounging in the cluttered office where outdated equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups. \nThe captain, CHURCH, has his feet on the desk.  He's fifty years old, gray and fat and soft.  The other officer, SLOAN, also a lieutenant, is a thirty-five year old woman, dark, moderately attractive, but not particularly happy. \nRUBRICK Colonel Mekum has his \"boys\" unpacked.  I think he wants to show them off. \nCHURCH Hmmmmph. \nRUBRICK They look...impressive. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  \"STATION\" - DAY \nA NEW SOLDIER fills the frame, a perfect-looking man/boy of about twenty built like a linebacker, powerful looking with sculpted unscarred musculature.  He looks straight ahead, unblinking, and so does the one next to him, and the next one.  Twenty of them are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was once a station of some sort.  They don't seem to respond to the chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights leaking sixty feet above them. \nWearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright- eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by, glowing with satisfaction. \nThe vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and a sense of emptiness to it. \nSLOAN walks close to the line of NEW SOLDIERS and studies one, her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies.  She breaks the long silence. \nSLOAN Well, they're...pretty. \nCHURCH (to Mekum) What's so hot about them? \nMEKUM (proudly) Very much improved.  In every way. \nRUBRICK This is Colonel Mekum from Q.  He's their commanding officer. \nCHURCH (dubious) Improved...how? \nMEKUM As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4. \nCHURCH (dubiously) Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying... \nRUBRICK and SLOAN exchange an eye-rolling private glance that means they've heard a lot of Daddy's sayings. \nCHURCH ...He used to say, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" \nMEKUM (patronizing) I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point... \nCHURCH (indicating the Veterans) Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these \"hot shots\" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They are battle-tested, aren't they? \nCHURCH Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one? \nMEKUM (smug grin, to Church) In a minute. (turning back to Sloan) Now, see this test?  This shows what they do under sleep deprivation conditions.  Forty-eight hours awake and they can... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TODD RUNNING/RUINS - DAY \nRain slashes his face as TODD runs, his eyes staring vacantly into the blinding storm, his legs pumping evenly, his feet chopping through the thick mud in a wasteland of shelled apartment buildings where rat-like CREATURES scurry out of his way as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  \"STATION\" - DAY \nSeparated by fifteen yards, the two groups of SOLDIERS, the NEW and the VETERAN, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly into space as they await orders.  Occasionally a VETERAN will rub his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away deliberately, expressionless.  Nobody flinches when a big door opens and pale light streams in. \nMEKUM is standing there in a poncho. \nMEKUM Melton, Eight Five.  Forward. \nMELTON, one of the husky new soldiers, climbs to his feet and steps toward MEKUM, saluting. \nMELTON Eight Five, sir. \nMEKUM Ten miles, Melton, on the run. \nMELTON's face shows no expression as MEKUM continues. \nMEKUM (O.S.) You've got sixty minutes.  Go. \nMELTON Sir! \nMELTON heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY \nTODD's breath comes in even rasps as his feet splash over rough terrain, splash splash splash, hard work but nothing in his stone face indicates he's not equal to the task.  Splash splash splash! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY \nIn the cluttered office, RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN look up from a conversation as MEKUM enters dripping wet and takes off his poncho, smiling smugly. MEKUM My man left exactly twenty minutes after yours.  Make a note of that. \nRUBRICK What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers? \nMEKUM (a shrug and a grin) Old soldiers never die. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY \nRunning.  Splash splash splash!  TODD makes a turn, heading back, his face like stone, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY \nMEKUM is filling his coffee cup as he speaks. \nMEKUM They'll serve as a labor force.  You can use them for physical stuff... loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that kind of thing. (a glance around the office) Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh, tidying up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY \nBreathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain. Something makes him glance back over his shoulder. \nThirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain. \nTODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running. \nThen he looks back again. \nThe vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer. \nTODD continues at the same even place.  He doesn't look back again until he feels closeness.  Then he looks. \nIT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly, keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's.  The bigger man moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine, inexorable. \nAs TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  \"STATION\" - DAY \nThe huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK, and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but not desperately. \nMEKUM Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological.  The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind. \nA shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer, takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at the same pace, his face like stone. \nTODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes. \nTODD Sir. \nRUBRICK At ease, soldier. \nCHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM. \nCHURCH What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired? MEKUM Tired? \nCHURCH Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube. \nRUBRICK (to Todd) Soldier!  Up the chain! TODD Sir. \nMELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face. \nANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of concern wrinkles his brow. \nANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders. MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps for air, but... \nGOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and... \nMELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward even as... \nTODD goes for face with his free hand. \nSLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow. \nTODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes. \nANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of MELTON's injury. \nANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank impassive faces, RILEY among them. \nANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like. \nANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face. \nMELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites furiously, drawing blood. \nTODD grits his teeth in pain. \nWHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow. \nTODD is losing his grip. \nRILEY watches below, his face a mask. \nMELTON bites and elbows furiously. \nTODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins to fall and then... \nPlunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand for twenty feet until... \nHe can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of ROMERO's broken body below. \nSudden silence! \nANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body. \nANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings. \nANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken. \nIt's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one- eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up... MEKUM GET DOWN HERE!  GET DOWN HERE ON THE DOUBLE, GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE, YOU MISERABLE PISS ANT STINKING SHIT FOR BRAINS! \nCHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK lift their stunned faces from TODD to MEKUM who's continuing to rant at MELTON as MELTON comes down the chain fast... MELTON COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, YOU MISERABLE THIRD RATE SHITHEAD INCOMPETENT CLOWN! \nMELTON lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet, landing gracefully on his feet in front of MEKUM and salutes. \nMELTON Sir! \nMEKUM LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG DUMB SHIT, YOU'VE LOST AN EYE.  WHAT THE HELL GOOD IS A GODDAMN ONE-EYED SOLDIER? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT COST TO BREED YOU, YOU BIG MORON?  TO TRAIN YOU, FEED YOU? \nAs MEKUM turns, including all the NEW SOLDIERS in his continuing tirade, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK confer in low voices. \nRUBRICK They're...fantastic! \nCHURCH (reluctant agreement) Mmmmmmm... \nSLOAN (worried) We could have a problem here, couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost three men... \nCHURCH Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. \"Training accident.\"  Paperwork. \nSLOAN What about the bodies? \nCHURCH (turning away) Incinerator. \nTurning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM who's still raging, indicating MELTON to the blank-faced NEW SOLDIERS. \nMEKUM WHAT GOOD IS THIS MAN NOW?  WITH ONE GOOD EYE!  HE'S GOT NO DEPTH PERCEPTION! HE'S CANNON FODDER.  ALL HE CAN DO IS WALK POINT AND TAKE THE FIRST HIT. \nCHURCH (interrupting) They're very...impressive. \nMEKUM (fuming) Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn't have lost an eye. \nCHURCH glances at TODD's corpse dumped over ROMERO's broken body, tries to assuage him. \nCHURCH It was our best man who got his eye...  Todd, a real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of -- MEKUM Old news!  They're nothing at all! Wait until you get these new fellas into some real action.  I guarantee you'll be awed.  I guarantee it. \nThe NEW SOLDIERS sit impassively, the bleeding MELTON among them, staring right at the VETERANS. \nNot far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FURNACES/FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT \nA rage of flame!  The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow fury, eight feet high. \nTwo men, BURNERS, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear, laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing.  With effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly consumed.  Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN, seven feet high, looming in the shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace.  It's overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom. \nThe BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object. \nIt's ROMERO's dead body.  They haul it out of the bin and let it flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at nothing. \nThe BURNERS stare at the body, exchange a blank look through their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward the flames. \nINT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM/CLOSE BY \nIn the near darkness, the faintest flickering light reveals two tangled BODIES, motionless in the confusion of refuse.  But not quite motionless!  A hand opens and closes!  A bloody hand! Fingers twitch. \nTiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along a cable, headed away from the junk mountain. \nAt ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of its great bulk. \nPeeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of \"his\" mountain.  The cable is twenty yards away in a \"canyon\" of junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed to the wind in order to get to it. \nHe starts out from behind the transformer... \nWHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet, his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable, struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights the wind, struggles toward the cable. \nSuddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time as it whistles close to his head. \nTODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl \"under the wind,\" toward the taut cable, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  \"STEEL HENGE\" - DUSK - LATER \nSeen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing in the distance and the dusk. \nFollowing them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him, vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must have crashed long ago. \nThe mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long way, it's almost dark, he's weak. \nHe hangs onto the wire, walking with effort. \nHe can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire. \nHe notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right. \nSteel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery. \nJust then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze. \nThen the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire and get weakly to his feet.  For a moment he looks like he might collapse, but he doesn't, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LANDSCAPE - NIGHT \nAt night the four suns glow darkly like night lights. \nTODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind, struggling along the wire, shivering. \nEvery stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing something ahead. \nIn the distance a faint light glows. \nTODD considers it as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded in a low mound of \"earth\" like a skylight.  Whatever is making the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only inches above the ground. \nTODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind. \nTODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten yards to the window and pears through it. \nTODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the wind. \n(What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.) \nANGLE ON TODD, prone on the \"roof,\" mystified.  He's never seen anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the wind. \nThe ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first arrived has diminished to a strong breeze. \nTODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He looks around. \nThe meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on the other window/skylight that glows from this strange \"roof\" and on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze... a MUSICAL sound. \nStruggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion. \nTODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window. \nTODD'S POV through the second \"window,\" another mysterious vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is just as puzzled. \nWhat he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music... \nANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights. \nThen he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he freezes...listening! \nA strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere... \nTODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows. There's nothing visible... \nThe mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything. \nSuddenly TODD understands, but he's too late... \nROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more powerful than ever! \nTODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind, struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed violently, somersaulted helplessly... \nEXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH \nWHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons that aren't clear. \nFinally he rolls over weakly and looks up. \nIn the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him from the wind howling overhead. \nTODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and injured even to crawl. \nLying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly sees something. \nSLADE It's not an unreasonable question. (to Todd) How about it, Sergeant? \nON TODD, actually struggling with the question... remembering.  Suddenly he blurts... \nTODD I was...replaced. \nMACE Replaced? \nTODD hesitates for half a second before answering. \nTODD By a better soldier, sir. \nThere are looks exchanged among the PIONEERS as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  GARDEN - DAY \nA little seedling is fitted into the earth gently.  TODD's strong hands pat the earth around it. \nTODD reaches for another seedling.  He's one of a group of ten PIONEERS, all on their hands and knees, all working intently, silently.  They seem to have accepted him.  Nobody stares. \nTODD is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when something causes him to look up. \nFive ENEMY SOLDIERS in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over him, weapons pointed at him.  All around them is a desert of sand stretching forever under a baking sun. \nOne of the soldiers kicks TODD. \nANGLE ON EMMA, JUDITH, and several other PIONEER WOMEN exchanging nervous glances as they look back to where TODD's kneeling. \nThere are no soldiers...but somehow, he's trampled several rows of seedlings. \nTODD looks toward them, confused, disoriented by his \"memory.\" \nThe women look away quickly, frightened, and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OTHER ROOM - NIGHT \nSANDRA is changing NATHAN's diaper as she chatters, her back to TODD. \nSANDRA ...And it got worse and worse.  My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence...  political feelings.  My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families.  That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded. \nAcross the room, TODD, wearing a T-shirt and baggy pants is sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever. \nAs SANDRA talks, her back to him, TODD's eyes are on the contours of her body against the shift she's wearing.  It's very...erotic. \nSANDRA Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.  A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.  But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care.  Maybe they think we're garbage too! \nTODD'S face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce. \nSANDRA So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it.  We became a... community. \nAs SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN, TODD catches glimpses of her breasts pushing against the material of the shift.  She continues, still not noticing where his attention is. \nSANDRA One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this? \nA wry laugh.  She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and catches TODD's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her breasts. \nFor a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers. \nSANDRA I guess that's what you like!  The fighting, I mean.  The wars. (unsure, a question really) You must...you're a soldier... \nTODD doesn't answer as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY \nThe CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway, watching something in the meeting room. \nHAWKINS, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the CHILDREN ahead. \nHAWKINS You children are supposed to be doing lessons. \nThe CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them. She looks at what they're looking at. \nWhat they're seeing through the doorway is TODD, shirtless, doing an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises.  His muscular body ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of stitches, the puckered patches of burns. \nHAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried. \nIn the midst of a slow graceful movement, TODD suddenly whirls and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all too obvious. \nEven as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently, TODD returns to the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that preceded the deadly thrust. \nThe CHILDREN's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape. \nHAWKINS shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud to the children. \nHAWKINS Lessons. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  INSIDE TRENCH - NIGHT \nIt's dark, the wind's HOWLING just above the trench walls as TODD peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench. \nTODD'S POV THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW reveals a tender moment between MACE and SANDRA as they enter the bedroom and kiss.  A flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates their shadows. \nANGLE ON TODD, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away. \nLight spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as TODD begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze of dark trenches. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BARREN WASTE - DAY \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY \nCleaning vegetables, SANDRA is separating the roots, shaking the dirt off, cutting away the excess. \nTODD is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away with the knife. \nNATHAN is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs. \nSANDRA It seemed like he was never going to walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's an expert. \nWhump!  NATHAN falls on his ass. \nSANDRA (a laugh) Well, not quite an expert. \nTODD watches SANDRA go to NATHAN and hug him affectionately. \nTurning back to the vegetables, stone faced, TODD cuts his finger.  Blood flows.  He ignores it, continues working... \nBut SANDRA, returning to the vegetables, notices TODD's cut finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand. \nTODD looks startled is she takes his finger.  Then, staunching the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious. \nSANDRA Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier? \nWhat's it like...?  TODD stares at her, trying to process the question.  Seeing his difficulty SANDRA tries to help... \nSANDRA What do you think about? \nNo answer, a stare. \nSANDRA Do you think about food?  Or women? You must think about something. \nTODD gulps.  His blank stare could pass for stupidity. \nSANDRA What about feelings then?  You must have feelings.  You must feel something. \nTODD wets his lips.  He seems about to answer...and yet it's difficult for him.  He could kill a person easier. \nOn the floor NATHAN GOOS happily, oblivious. \nTODD (at last) Fear. \nSANDRA (startled) Fear!  You mean...you feel afraid? (as he nods) That's when you're in battle... What about other times?  Now, for example? \nTODD Fear. \nSANDRA (amazed) Now? \nTODD Always. \nA stunned silence.  Finally SANDRA speaks... \nSANDRA You don't...look afraid.  You look fearless. \nTODD looks at her.  This is incredibly difficult for him, like physical labor.  He wets his lips and take a breath. \nTODD Fear and...discipline. \nSANDRA (growing horror) Oh, my God.  But there's nothing to be afraid of here.  I can't hurt you.  I wouldn't. \nTODD Always.  It makes us...alert. \nSANDRA is overwhelmed.  She reaches for him, hugs him to her breast like a little baby, holding him. \nBut TODD is as tense in her arms as steel.  He can't relax.  He's even trembling. \nNATHAN, on the floor, looks up, smiles innocently. \nSANDRA lets go of TODD and steps back, looking at him, her face troubled, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY \nELLEN is supervising block building (babysitting) with several of the younger children (OMAR, BUCKY, ANGIE and JANICE) while WILL and TOMMY play their own separate games close by.  Then WILL looks up and sees something disturbing. \nWILL You're not supposed to do that anymore. \nHe's speaking to JOHNNY who is doing martial exercises. \nJOHNNY So what?  I'm a soldier. \nWILL They're gonna kick him out. \nELLEN looks up from the blocks. \nELLEN They can't kick him out... \nWILL They're gonna.  My father -- \nELLEN (interrupting strongly) My mother says when someone's sick or hurt, you have to help them.  You don't have a choice. \nJOHNNY (getting interested) Yeah, but what if the hurt person is...evil? \nELLEN You still have to help them... because if you don't, you're evil! \nWILL (importantly) My father says...uh...he says, \"Soldiers deserve soldiers.\" \nTOM Yeah.  That's what my father said too. \nELLEN My father's making Sergeant Todd a scarf because he saved his life one time.  He's knitting it. WILL That's dumb.  Your father's dumb. \nWILL is smirking with satisfaction at having settled that when out of nowhere ELLEN's little fist hits him hard on the nose. WILL looks stunned.  Blood oozes from his nose.  He starts to cry. \nELLEN looks horrified at what she's done as we... \nMACE Maybe he is.  It doesn't matter. \nMACE is staring grimly at the ceiling as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nSilent and surreal, the events of 1986 continue with the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD sitting on the floor while the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR- OLD looks down at him, and other FOUR-YEAR-OLDS gather ominously. \nIt's only now, as he gets to his feet, suddenly trading vicious blows with the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD that we realize that this passive boy is FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD.  The boys don't fight like children; they don't quit or cry as the blood flows. \nHighly-polished shoes, sharply creased trousers, and eyes glittering from the shadows are all that is visible of the faceless OBSERVERS who make no move to interrupt the violence. \nFOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD, his nose pouring blood, exchanges savage hurtful blows with his opponent, bloodying him viciously, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY (PRESENT) \nEyes!  The adult TODD blinks away the memory, stares straight ahead... \ninto NATHAN'S face, only six inches from his own. \nThey're all alone in the room.  It's very quiet. \nNATHAN smiles a tentative smile, raises a hand, reaches out to touch TODD'S face affectionately, curiously, testing their friendship... ANGLE ON TODD, his eyes.  Dangerous.  He draws his face back enough to avoid being touched. \nNATHAN looks unsure.  He's used to affection.  Then he realizes... it must be a game!  He reaches out again... \nAgain TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something catches his eye. \nTODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN. \nNATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game. \nTODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN. \nNATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift.  He's pleased.  It's that kind of game!  He gives TODD a friendly \"thanks for the boot\" smile. \nTODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now. \nNATHAN looks at the VIPER.  He doesn't understand what he's supposed to do. \nTODD makes a hitting motion with his hand. \nThe VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling. \nNATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD. \nTODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes.  His look is intense, a message in his eyes. \nThe VIPER is like a spring, it strikes... \nTODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the snake and flips it a couple of feet. \nNATHAN stares. \nThe angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again. \nNATHAN looks at TODD. \nTODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes. \nNATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea. \nThe VIPER is about to strike again... \nSQUASH!  A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it. \nTODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down for NATHAN.  As MACE hugs the boy protectively to his chest, he glares down at TODD with eyes blazing with fury. \nTODD meets the look without blinking.  He never blinks. \nSANDRA (O.S.) What happened? \nTODD turns to see SANDRA standing in the bedroom door, her eyes almost as hard as TODD's as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nTODD stares impassively as HAWKINS addresses him... \nHAWKINS No one here has any animosity toward you, Sergeant.  None of us here is your enemy. \nTODD is standing in front of the room full of grim-faced PIONEERS, all looking at him.  It's like a court. \nHAWKINS is flanked by MACE and SANDRA... \nHAWKINS Moreover, we respect your qualities. We have no doubt that you are a very, very good soldier. \nAs she speaks, TODD's blank stare considers the weathered faces of the PIONEERS facing him.  He sees CHESTER, EVA, RED with his WIFE, JIMMY PIG and his WIFE, SLADE and MRS. SLADE, JUDITH, EMMA, SALLY.  As HAWKINS continues, TODD's sharp eyes pick out details. He sees JIMMY PIG opening and closing his hands nervously, he sees SLADE fingering a barely noticeable rifle barrel.  CHESTER has a weapon too. \nHAWKINS (O.S.) But, because of your training, I don't think you'll ever be able to function in a group like this, a community of vulnerable people, of families, of children, where the ability to fight is not the sole purpose of existence. \nThe PIONEERS are nervous, ready for trouble, afraid TODD might take this badly and fly off the handle. \nAs TODD's huge hand opens...and closes, their eyes are on it.  He could pick up the table and hurl it at them, break men in half with his bare hands.  His face is like stone, his eyes like diamond chips as he glances toward SANDRA. \nTODD sees SANDRA is moved, trying to suppress her emotions, biting her lip, as HAWKINS goes on... \nHAWKINS You're different from us, Sergeant. We don't hate you for that, but we have agreed that to try to include you would pose an intolerable risk to the community itself. \nMACE We'll give you any tools you need, warm clothing, a good knife, boots. \nSANDRA (emotionally) And if you're ever sick...or you get hurt... \nRUBRICK (reading, not interested) Yeah?  What flavor pain in the ass? Gravity pain in the ass?  Atmosphere pain in the ass? \nCHURCH How about a \"gaseous currents\" and \"urgent convections\" pain in the ass. \nSLOAN I think you're trying to say a \"wind pain in the ass.\" \nRUBRICK Wind! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PIPE - DAY \nWIND!  As the wind RAGES outside, TODD, wearing his parka, crouches over a tiny fire inside a huge open-ended pipe twelve feet in diameter.  He stares at the bleak, windy landscape outside his shelter.  He looks primitive, like a caveman, and very very alone as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PIPE - DUSK \nThe fat section of pipe is twenty feet long squatting in the blowing litter on the grim landscape in the shadow of the junk mountains.  Somehow that inanimate pipe also looks lonely in the vastness as the four suns overhead darken toward evening. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STARS - NIGHT \nStars glitter behind the dimmed suns as the wind HOWLS and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PIPE - DAY \nThe fire is nothing but coals.  TODD sits stoically over the embers, more alone than ever, chewing on a piece of dried food, part of his spartan meal. \nAs he chews, he stares blankly at nothing until... \nA single tear crawls down one cheek. \nThen another. \nTODD looks like a stone statue oozing tears.  He reaches up and touches the strange water with his finger, then studies the finger, as though a tear were the most remarkable thing he's ever seen.  He cannot remember anything like this; he cannot remember ever having cried. \nAnd suddenly, without warning, he's convulsed with tears, heaving with sobs, alone in the big pipe with the pitiful little fire, bawling like a baby as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - DAY \nA VIPER writhes across the floor through the patterns of light streaming through the window, a sinister presence, full of menace and evil designs. \nThe VIPER winds its way toward an object that will prove in a moment to be a corner of the bad. \nSMACK!  The VIPER doesn't make it!  SMACK!  Another blow from MACE's heavy boot being swung by hand. \nThe VIPER coils and HISSES angrily, wounded and dangerous. \nSMACK!  The boot again! \nNATHAN wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the HISSING VIPER! \nSMACK!  NATHAN hits again and... \nMACE rolls over in the bed. \nSMACK!  MACE comes awake, looks around. \nMACE lunges from the bed. \nSMACK!  Just as NATHAN gives the damaged VIPER another blow, MACE snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away. \nSANDRA sits up in bad, looking around, alarmed. \nMACE is holding NATHAN, staring down at the VIPER. \nThe VIPER has up the ghost, lying on the floor. \nMACE hugs NATHAN to him and looks toward SANDRA.  They both look at the boot.  And at the dead VIPER. \nTheir eyes meet and, for a long moment, they just look at each other. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER \nMACE is wearing his parka, pulling on his eye protectors hurriedly as he opens the door to the corridor.  SANDRA's voice makes him stop and turn to her. \nSANDRA Mace!  What about the vote? Everybody voted. \nMace glares at her for a moment, knowing she's right.  Then he turns away and starts out defiantly. \nMACE We voted wrong! \nSANDRA looks relieved and worried at the same time and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LANDSCAPE - DAY \nThis time MACE is the tiny figure struggling along the wire in the wind, alone on the vast landscape under four suns. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  OUTER SPACE/\"DADDY\" - \"DAY\" \nThe military ship called \"DADDY\" (Defend And Attack Deployment Entity) is a big ugly insect gliding through a black silent void. On the grimy bulwark of the ship are the letters NAF followed by serial numbers and the logo of the North American Forces. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  COCKPIT - DAY \nThe driver is the beady-eyed giant, CAINE 607.  Reacting to what he see, he adjusts the vehicle to the right. \nEXT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE \nTwo ominous NEW SOLDIERS wearing plexi-goggles and bulky armor under their uniforms hang on the outside of the CRAWLER in the wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big rocket rifles across their chests.  They're looking ahead toward the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly forward through the litter, an evil vision. \nEXT.  LANDSCAPE \nTODD and MACE are running, TODD in the lead, buffeted by wind, struggling through a clutter of old machinery, diesel engines, turbines, scattered haphazardly on the flat desert floor. \nMACE is running too, not as well, and TODD has to reach back and grab him, pull him along... \nMACE (gasp) ...maybe...they're... (gasp) ...friendly... \nINT.  CRAWLER \nThe GUNNER works a servomotor, aiming a cannon, as he peers through a scope. \nThrough the scope, surrounded by digital readouts, we see two tiny running FIGURES... \nEXT.  CRAWLER \nBALAAM!  BALAAM!  The CRAWLER cannon FIRES... \nEXT.  LANDSCAPE \nMACE screams, he's hurled wildly mid-stride, tossed ten yards. \nTODD looks back, sees him lying on the sand, screaming in pain. \nTODD turns back, sprinting, low, weaving, tossed by the wind. \nWHOOOM!  Another SHOT.  If the wind hadn't hit him, TODD would have been hit. \nMACE is screaming.  His right leg is gone. \nTODD gets him, drags him, stumbles. \nWHOOM!  Another SHOT, another miss. \nTODD struggles for cover, staggering in the wind with MACE on his back. \nINT.  CRAWLER \nThrough his scope, the GUNNER sees TODD and MACE dive behind a big turbine. \nUnhurriedly the GUNNER flicks a switch on the dash. \nCAINE 607 nods approval. \nThe GUNNER works the servo, bringing the cannon to bear on the turbine. \nEXT.  TURBINES \nTODD is dragging MACE along behind the cover of the turbine, glancing back for what he knows will occur. \nBAWHOOM!  The area where they disappeared EXPLODES, chunks of steel fly. \nTODD keeps pulling MACE, who looks half dead as... \nBAWHOOM!  The TURBINE is hit again! \nINT.  CRAWLER \nThrough the scope, the GUNNER aims again and watches another chunk of turbine disintegrate. \nThe GUNNER glances at the robot-faced driver.  Their eyes meet. CAINE 607 nods.  Obviously, they've killed the two men. \nThe GUNNER points to the cable. \nCAINE 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike. \nEXT.  ABANDONED ENGINES/TERRAIN \nTODD is crouched over MACE inside an abandoned diesel engine not far from the disintegrated turbine.  He's making a tourniquet to stop the bleeding from the stump of MACE's leg.  MACE looks awful, pale, in shock.  He speaks weakly. MACE Oh, shit, Todd...I'm...dead... aren't I?  I'm not going to make it. \nTODD meets his look but doesn't answer.  He finishes the tourniquet and turns his back on MACE to peer out through a gap in the engine at the CRAWLER. \nTODD sees the CRAWLER approach the cable, watches it veer left and start to travel along the cable...straight toward the colony! \nTODD turns and looks into MACE's face.  MACE's eyes are clouded with horror. \nMACE Why?  Why? \nNo answer. \nMACE I'm not..a soldier. (then...) A...mistake?  Was it...a mistake? \nTODD shakes his head no.  MACE's eyes fill with new horror. \nMACE Oh, my God.  They won't...they won't...?  Not Sandra!  Not... not...Nathan! \nTODD turns away from MACE and peers through the machinery. \nHe can see the CRAWLER is a hundred yards away now, traveling along the cable toward the colony. \nHe can see the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS hanging on the outside of the CRAWLER, hard faces, goggled and ominous. \nWhen TODD turns back to MACE, he finds MACE eyeing him with pure hatred.  MACE sneers weakly. \nMACE Soldiers!  Soldiers... (gasp) ...deserve...soldiers! \nHis eyes roll back.  He's dead. \nTODD peers out again at the NEW SOLDIERS.  They look invincible as we.. \nCUT TO: \nRILEY is standing rigidly in front of his bunk in crew quarters, flanked by the rest of the VETERANS in similar positions, facing SLOAN. \nRILEY Will we be issued weapons, sir? \nSLOAN (a sneering smile) No, Riley...no weapons.  You're not a soldier, Riley. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCHES - DAY \nThe NEW SOLDIER comes straight, like some inexorable death machine, lumbering awkwardly with his burden of weapons, goggled and blank faced. \nA PIONEER is backing away ten yards in front of him, firing wildly.  POW!  POW!  POW! \nThe NEW SOLDIER looks at one of his armor-gloved hands, opening the palm in front of his face.  His hand's been hit.  He shakes it, annoyed, like it was a bee sting, then he aims at the PIONEER. \nWHOOOOSH!  A tongue of fire from the NEW SOLDIER's flame thrower engulfs the helpless PIONEER as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY \nPIONEERS are crouching in the room when the door bursts open, and a tongue of flame turns the room into a firestorm and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR - DAY \nSANDRA has NATHAN screaming in her arms as she calmly herds frightened CHILDREN through a corridor, JOHNNY, WILL, and ELLEN among them. \nSANDRA Keep going, children, don't panic, don't panic. \nBut if her demeanor doesn't reveal her fear, her eyes do. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  INSIDE ANOTHER TRENCH - DAY \nTwo Pioneers, SALLY and RED, lunge from a doorway into the trench and fire a rifle and a pistol at a THIRD SOLDIER who's advancing along the trench. \nBANG!  BANG!  PING!  SPLAT! \nSALLY and RED dive back in the doorway for cover where a pioneer named SINGH is crouched, watching with alarm the THIRD SOLDIER advancing unfazed. \nANGLE ON THE THIRD SOLDIER coming toward them. \nANGLE ON THE PIONEERS huddled in the doorway. \nRED They got armored vests.  You got to aim for exposed parts like the face... \nSINGH Here goes. \nRED and SALLY watch SINGH step out directly in front of the advancing THIRD SOLDIER and FIRE five shots rapidly...PING! PIZG!  PING!  PING!  PING! \nWHOOOOSH!  RED and SALLY see SINGH incinerated before their eyes. \nExchanging a horrified glance, they turn to retreat down the interior corridor, but before they get two steps, they freeze... \nA SOLDIER is in the corridor, not looking at them, but breaking down a door.  They can't go that way! \nTrapped, they turn to see the THIRD SOLDIER almost to the doorway, his flame thrower aimed, his finger on the trigger, and... \nA blur!  Something lands on the THIRD SOLDIER from above the trench, and the THIRD SOLDIER falls over backwards, slamming hard to the floor of the trench. \nBut he's a super soldier, so that almost at the same time he hits the ground he's already lunging upward to regain his feet and fight except... \nA knife blade rips across his throat, opening it wide in one swift movement, and... \nThe THIRD SOLDIER's head sags back because not even superman can fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi goggles is... \nTODD looming over him with a bloody knife, a face like stone, and fierce soldier's eyes. \nANGLE ON THE DOORWAY, where RED, SALLY, and another PIONEER peer around the corner, eyes wide with amazement at the sight of TODD kneeling over his victim. \nANGLE ON TODD, slipping the utility belt off the dead THIRD SOLDIER, yanking grenades and ammo from the bulky body, stuffing a heavy pistol in his own waistband. \nRED approaches timidly. \nRED You want help, partner? \nTODD glances up at him, and RED sees TODD'S eyes and RED backs away quickly because... \nTODD looks badder even than the new soldiers! \nTurning back to the dead man, TODD goes for the last item...the goggles.  Ripping them off he reveals... \nA one-eyed soldier.  The dead man staring up at him is MELTON. \nFor just a moment TODD stares into the dead face, revealing nothing of how he feels, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY \nNATHAN is SCREAMING in terror on the floor, ignored as SANDRA and CHILDREN haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of obstacles they've placed in front of the door already.  The stove, everything is wedged against the door to the corridor. \nAs they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other belongings, the door quivers, the heap of furniture shifts. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nThe FIRST SOLDIER, as big as an offensive tackle, shoulders the door again, and it gives... \nINT.  ROOM \nCHILDREN SCREAM as the mountain of furniture heaves backwards, and the door opens part way, revealing the FIRST SOLDIER. \nSANDRA grabs NATHAN and hands him to one of the children. \nThe four suns are dimming noticeably, dusk is falling. \nThe wind HOWLS, junk drifts and shifts. \nA corpse turns over in the wind.  It's HAWKINS' BODY, ravaged by the turbulent air, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  EARTHEN CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT \nSomeone is dragging a CORPSE down the smoky, lamplit corridor as little NATHAN watches SANDRA tending to the bloody wounds of a PIONEER lying on the floor.  As the CORPSE is dragged past NATHAN, the lifeless, vacant eyes stare right at the uncomprehending little boy. \nNATHAN sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, ANGIE, sobbing uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds.  SANDRA is trying to help with the bandages and console ANGIE at the same time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people GROAN and children CRY OUT. \nNATHAN doesn't understand it, it's confusing.  MEN and WOMEN loom past him.  He wobbles off down the corridor, toddling away from the sounds of pain. \nSHUK!  KA-SHUK!  Strange SOUNDS come from a doorway ahead, the doorway to the meeting room.  CHAK!  KLAK!  SHIK CHIK KA CHIK! The sound of metal and metal, metal parts CLICKING and SLIDING. \nAlone in the corridor, NATHAN toddles innocently forward, toward the SOUNDS. \nINT.  MEETING ROOM \nNATHAN wobbles into the meeting room doorway and stops there, staring. \nThe burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room, leaving a large open space where TODD, bare-chested, a tourniquet on one arm, is squatting on the floor, skillfully reassembling a stripped rifle. \nSurrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles, pistols, ammo clips, utility belts, goggles, torn armor vests, boots, grenades, knives, and flashlights he salvaged from the dead soldiers.  TODD looks up at NATHAN and their eyes meet. \nNATHAN recognizes his \"friend,\" tries a tentative little smile. But TODD just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from NATHAN's face.  For a long moment they just look each other in the eyes very seriously. \nSANDRA enters, her dress covered with the wounded man's blood. Not noticing TODD, she rushes to NATHAN, grabs him... \nSANDRA Nathan, thank God, there you... \nSuddenly seeing TODD she breaks off, stares at him. \nSquatting on the floor, surrounded by weapons, TODD'S eyes meet hers for a long moment...then he looks away, goes back to assembling the weapons with quick sure movements, almost as if he wanted to avoid her eyes. \nSANDRA wets her lips to speak, hesitates, then finally blurts out what she can hardly bear to ask... \nSANDRA Did he find you? \nNo answer.  TODD finishes with the weapon, starts checking the next one. \nSANDRA My husband...Mace...he went out to look for you.  He...found you, didn't he? \nTODD looks up at her and nods.  Their eyes lock. \nSANDRA They...killed him...didn't they? \nTODD nods, turns back to his arsenal. \nSANDRA stands there, hugging NATHAN to her chest, holding her tears in, her lids quivering, fighting to conquer her emotion. After a long, difficult moment, she wins the battle with herself. She looks numb, stunned, but she's not crying. \nTODD has begun to dress.  He straps a sheath knife to one ankle, pulls on boots.  Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso, covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and the tourniquet on his arm. \nStaring at him with glazed eyes, SANDRA notices a blotch of blood form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet.  She speaks numbly. \nSANDRA Your wound...it's still bleeding. \nStuffing his pockets with ammo and other items, TODD glances at her with eyes that glitter dangerously. TODD I like to bleed, sir. \nSANDRA stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress, pulling on a heavy armored vest. \nSANDRA It doesn't...hurt? \nTODD pulls on a second armored vast, one that already has a ragged hole in it from a rocket. \nTODD Not enough, sir. \nSANDRA watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the corner and take a blackened stick from it, watches him smear charcoal under his eyes. \nSANDRA How do you know they'll come back? \nTODD looks at her, a savage with blackened eyes. \nTODD They're soldiers, sir.  Like me. \nSANDRA What...what do they want? \nTODD Nothing. \nSANDRA Nothing? \nTODD They are obeying orders, sir.  It's their duty. \nFor a moment SANDRA is silent, then... \nSANDRA You know who they are, don't you? Do you know how many there'll be? \nTODD crosses two utility belts across his armored chest like bandoliers. \nTODD Seventeen more, sir. \nSANDRA Seventeen!  My God! (suddenly energized) You can't fight seventeen yourself! You have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do.  We don't have your...your skills...but we're not cowards.  We'll do what you tell us, we'll -- \nTODD (interrupting, softly) No. \nHis voice is soft as silk but hard as steel.  She looks into his eyes.  Does she detect a hint of approval, of respect, in those flat expressionless snake eyes? \nSANDRA Why not? \nTODD turns to go, laden with weapons, a flamethrower on his back, a rocket rifle on his shoulder, another in one hand. \nTODD Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir. \nSANDRA But...one soldier against seventeen! \nINT.  CRAWLER ONE \nManeuvering across the junk-strewn landscape, the DRIVER peers through the cracked windshield at the green terrain, looking for TODD as the RADIO crackles... \nRADIO Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Do you have a sitrep? \nTHE GUNNER and the DRIVER exchange a glance.  The GUNNER takes the mike and speaks into it. \nGUNNER Crawler Two, we are one down, responding to sniper activity. \nINT.  CRAWLER TWO \nCAINE 607 is at the wheel, speaking into his mike. \nCAINE 607 Crawler One, do you require assistance? \nRADIO That is negative.  We will eliminate the sniper and rendezvous at target. \nCAINE 607 Roger, One.  We are proceeding to target. \nCAINE 607 accelerates the CRAWLER. \nEXT.  JUNK TERRAIN \nThe flare fades and the near darkness returns. \nANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE peering out into the stillness, then signaling NEW SOLDIER TWO who's hiding nearby. \nAs the two NEW SOLDIERS step out from their sheltered positions, they're joined by NEW SOLDIER THREE.  Exchanging hand signals, the three of them advance, spreading out cautiously. \nNEW SOLDIER THREE has moved about thirty yards away when suddenly he \"disappears.\" \nEXT.  INSIDE A \"CATCM TRENCH\" \nSPLASH!  SOLDIER THREE has tumbled into a flooded trench. \nHe struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is.  He pulls a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both directions. \nThe flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in water and littered with rusting junk. \nNEW SOLDIER THREE splashes along the trench, looking for a way out. \nHis light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the trench, a perfect ladder. \nHe's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his beam down the trench behind him. \nNEW SOLDIER THREE'S POV of the flooded trench.  Junk and water. \nANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER THREE, turning back and approaching the ladder.  Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again. \nAgain his light illuminates the spooky trench.  Again, nothing but water and junk. \nRelieved, he's just about to switch off his light when... \nTODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon. \nBefore NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him. EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN \nAs he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE stiffens.  Was that a stifled CRY?  Or not? \nNEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH \nTODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant.  TODD is hastily rummaging through the soldier's equipment, looking for something. \nHe finds it. \nEXT.  JUNK TERRAIN \nNEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly a flare bursts above them. \nThe NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them in a brightly illuminated landscape.  Before they can take cover... \nBUDDA BUDDA BUDDA.  Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench. \nNEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing on the ground, SCREAMING. \nANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench, accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS.... \nANGLE ON THE OTHER NEW SOLDIERS, prone, firing toward the trench. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH \nTracers whizzing over the top of the trench illuminate TODD as he races down the trench, running for his life. \nEXT.  JUNK TERRAIN \nStill firing, CRAWLER ONE grinds up to the lip of the trench. \nANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS charging toward the trench behind the CRAWLER. \nCLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid! The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and diminishes backward like a man pissing... \nINT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH \nTODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench, sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench. \nSheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries to scale the steep wall of the trench. \nWHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The surface of the water-filled trench bursts into flame.  A fiery river of flammable liquid. \nANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS reacting to something! \nNEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them. \nANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS firing as they move toward TODD. They've got him now! \nPeering through the scope as he sweeps the terrain, the GUNNER suddenly stiffens and back-pans to find something... \nGUNNER Tentative at One. \nThe DRIVER angles right, aiming for one o'clock. \nGUNNER That's negative, no target. \nThe DRIVER swings the wheel back and they continue slowly through the darkness. \nIn the back seat, two NEW SOLDIERS peer into the night with blank faces.  One of them is watching a huge plastic sign cartwheel past in the wind when -- \n-- he reacts! \n-- as TODD'S face appears is only inches from his, right against the plexi! \nBAM!  Before the NEW SOLDIER can do more than look startled, TODD shoots out the window with a pistol and shoves a live grenade through the hole. \nNEW SOLDIER RED!  RED!  RE -- \nBAWHOOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES and... \nThe DRIVER fights for control of the wheel. \nThe GUNNER screams and screams and screams like a machine running at high speed while the two NEW SOLDIERS lie open-eyed with death in the back seat. \nEXT.  CRAWLER \nNo sign of TODD.  Disappeared again. \nAs the wind ROARS furiously, the damaged CRAWLER limps along. \nINT.  CRAWLER ONE \nThe dying GUNNER is making awful noises while the DRIVER, eyes glazed, his face streaming with blood, maneuvers the vehicle slowly and cautiously, looking for the enemy... \nBut all he sees through the cracked windshield is a shadowy world of wind-tossed debris. \nEXT.  JUNK TERRAIN \nProtected by a hunk of pipe, TODD crouches and watches the CRAWLER, his eyes glittering, his weapon ready.  It's clear now that the tables are turned and he is the hunter as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT \nEXPLOSIONS!  SCREAMS!  BAWHOOM!  Another shell hits, beams splinter, dirt walls collapse. \nEight-year old JOHNNY, alone and terrified, comes in to view around a corner.  He's been separated from the others. \nJOHNNY DAD!  DAAAAAAD! \nNo answer. \nJOHNNY doesn't know which way to go.  The world's falling apart! \nWHUMP!  The little warren of earthen corridors is shaken by another BLAST. \nDesperate, JOHNNY makes a left, away from the last blast and hurries down a collapsing corridor past doorways that reveal rooms with no ceilings where the wind HOWLS.  It's obvious the shelling has been going on for a while. \nJOHNNY DAAAAAAAD! \nJust then, JIMMY PIG pops out of a doorway in front of him and and rushes toward him. \nJIMMY PIG GOTCHA! \nBA-WHOOM!  Another shell collapses the corridor behind JOHNNY as JIMMY PIG grabs him and hauls him toward the door he emerged from, the Dining Commons. \nINT.  DINING COMMONS \nEMMA is ushering CHILDREN through a trap door in the floor into the root cellar as JIMMY PIG ushers JOHNNY into the room. \nJOHNNY Where's my father?  Where's my father? \nJOHNNY looks around urgently. \nSANDRA is bandaging TOMMY'S arm while ELLEN, NATHAN, and WILL are huddling under a table in the most protected corner of the room. \nJIMMY PIG and JUDITH exchange a pained look as JIMMY PIG pushes JOHNNY toward SANDRA and the table. \nJIMMY PIG Johnny, get over under that table with Miss Sandra and Ellen and the others.  Miss Judith, you better go on down the root cellar with Emma and help with the ones down there. \nJOHNNY Where's my mother? \nBAH-DOOOM!  Another fierce CONCUSSION twenty yards away shakes dirt from the ceiling.  ELLEN beckons from under the table... \nELLEN Come on, Johnny. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SETTLEMENT - NIGHT \nMUZZLE FLASH!  FFFWHOOOMP!  CRAWLER TWO fires another round. \nThe vehicle is squatting not thirty yards from the trench garden, pouring round after round into the colony, lighting the night with bright-colored flowery blasts. \nCrouched in the wind not far from the vehicle, the two NEW SOLDIERS from the back seat have set up a mortar, and they too are firing away. \nINT.  CRAWLER TWO/STATlONARY \nThe GUNNER is looking through his scope, methodically aiming and firing as CAINE 607 at the wheel watches impassively. \nKA-FOOMP!  Another shot, the vehicle rocks, and, five hundred yards away, fire and dirt fountain thirty feet into the air. \nBEEP!  BEEP!  A light on the dash blinks on.  CAINE 607 switches on a radarscope, spots a blip. \nThe GUNNER takes his eyes off the scope, looks at the blip. \nJIMMY PIG starts chopping furiously. \nSLADE picks up a rifle, hands it to RED. \nSLADE Do what you can. \nAs RED looks at the rifle, alarmed, SLADE \"comforts\" him. \nSLADE They're gonna kill us anyhow.  No point in surrendering. (grabbing the axe) Turn! \nJIMMY PIG gasps for air as SLADE takes over chopping again. \nRED exits, worried. \nINT.  THE MEETING ROOM \nHuddled in a makeshift shelter of overturned furniture, with NATHAN asleep on her lap, SANDRA is reciting to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY, ANGIE, eight year old RAMON. \nSANDRA \"-- sailed an a river of crystal light into a sea of dew.  Where are you going and what do you wish the old moon asked the three.  'We've come to fish for herring fish...'\" \nTOMMY What's a \"moon?\" \nJOHNNY I know what a moon is!  It's... \nSANDRA (suddenly, urgently) SHHHHHHH! \nSANDRA is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the door...and sounds. \nShe puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering CHILD, hushes another. \nA timber falls outside the door and SANDRA sees a shadowy shape enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness. \nFrightened CHILDREN hold their breath, peer out fearfully. \nCRACK!  SMASH!  The huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way, switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness. \nThe light wipes the damaged room. \nSuddenly, SANDRA gasps. \nSANDRA Oh, my God!  It's... it's you! \nTODD maneuvers the flashlight beam, sees the frightened CHILDREN. \nSANDRA Are you...all right? \nTODD We should go, sir. \nSANDRA Go? \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nPeering into the smoke, RED reacts. \nRED'S POV of CAINE 607, obscured by smoke, crossing the corridor ahead, not seeing RED. \nANGLE ON RED, summoning all his courage, raising his rifle, aiming. \nBANG! \nANGLE ON CAINE 607 reacting, looking toward RED. \nANGLE ON RED scared to death, firing again!  And again! \nANGLE ON CAINE 607 wrenching a heavy door from its hinges and holding it in front of him, shielding himself from RED's continuous shooting, advancing. \nANGLE ON RED, firing again and again...and backing up. \nANGLE ON CAINE 607 holding the door/shield as he advances on RED. \nBacking, RED trips, goes down flat on his back. \nCAINE 607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him. \nRED shoves the door aside, aims his gun up at CAINE 607, as the huge soldier looms over him. \nBefore RED can pull the trigger, CAINE 607 snatches the rifle barrel and yanks the weapon out of RED'S hands. \nRED rolls, scrambles to his feet. \nAnd CAINE 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle, crushes his skull with three brutal blows. \nINT.  ROOM \nTODD'S impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness he feels at what's happening to him.  TOMMY is seated on his shoulders, he's got NATHAN in one arm and JOHNNY is nervously looking up at him as he clutches at TODD'S huge free hand, and now a little girl, SARAH, clutches at his combat pants as SANDRA instructs her. \nSANDRA Sarah, you hang on to Sergeant Todd. No matter what happens! \nClutching TODD's combat pants fiercely, SARAH looks up timidly at the big stonefaced man as SANDRA turns to ELLEN. \nSANDRA Ellen, go to the Commons.  Tell Jimmy Pig and Mr. Slade that Sergeant Todd says we have to leave as soon as they get everybody out of the root-cellar.  Can you do that? \nELLEN (scared) Uh, yes, ma'am. \nSANDRA It's all right.  The soldiers are gone for now.  But be careful where you walk.  And if it's too smoky, just come back. \nSARAH (on her way out) Yes, ma'am. \nSANDRA (calling after her) Tell them to bring all the food and clothing they can carry. (turning to the children) Do you all understand that Sergeant Todd here is going to help us, and whatever he says to do you must do immediately, as if he was your father or your mother. \nSARAH (tears) He's not my father! \nANGLE ON TODD'S stone face.  Unfamiliar territory. \nSANDRA No... but he's our friend.  Our good friend.  Do you understand? \nFrightened faces look to the awkward \"killing machine.\" \nCHURCH Not only are we apparently out twenty of your fancy new soldiers, your supermen, we're out both crawlers and all the weapons...so we can't arm the old soldiers, the ones you \"improved\" on, to defend ourselves... \nSLOAN (panicky, blurting at the screen) We've got to get out of here, Colonel Mekum! \nCHURCH flashes a scowl at SLOAN as, on the screen, MEKUM erupts excitedly. \nMEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE Abort?  You want to lose twenty top soldiers to a phantom army and then abort the mission?  Do you know what that would look like on my record? Or yours?  We'd be explaining it for the next fifty years from some goddam assignment in God knows where, we'd -- \nCHURCH (interrupting sharply) Well, how's it gonna look when we lose the ship too?  How's that gonna look on the old record?  'Cause that's what's gonna happen if we don't get our ass outta here.  We can't defend ourselves with no weapons and -- \nMEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE (fighting his own panic) Hold on, hold on there, Captain!  At ease!  Let's calm down and remember...remember we're soldiers. \nCHURCH (sarcastic) Good plan, Colonel. \nMEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE (moving on, improvising) Now we can't just get the shit kicked out of us by an unknown guerilla army...  But maybe we could...alter...our objective... \nCHURCH Meaning? \nMEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE Nuke the joint...and get out! \nDelighted with his own genius, MEKUM smiles triumphantly from the video screen as RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH exchange stunned looks and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nWHUMP!  TODD's bloodied head is slammed on the floor.  His eyes are almost swollen shut as he looks up at CAINE 607 kneeling on top of him.  Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath coming in gasps, but it's CAINE 607 who's on top, beating the last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one more time...before he slumps unconscious. \nHorrified, NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with the last of his strength, \"finishing him off.\"  NATHAN can't stand it. \nHe toddles toward CAINE 607, who's still on all fours, and attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's bloody face. \nThe frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHAN's ineffectual blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet. \nOnce standing, he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees.  For a moment he's confused.  What's this? \nThen he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself.  When he looks down at NATHAN again, tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as dead.  One blow and... \nBut just then big hands close around CAINE 607's ankles, tackling him.  As the giant topples, TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls on top of the fallen man. \nAs CAINE 607 looks up into TODD's fierce face, the fight goes out of his eyes.  He knows he's beaten, he knows TODD will never quit.  He's helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as TODD puts the pressure on, CAINE 607 whispers... \nCAINE 607 It hurts! \nTODD (sympathetic) I know. \nSNAP!  TODD breaks CAINE 607's neck and watches the life go out of him. \nIn the sudden silence as TODD, panting, stares at his defeated enemy, he hears a VOICE...her VOICE...very weak... \nSANDRA Sergeant... \nTODD turns and sees SANDRA slumped against the wall where Caine 607 threw her.  There's a trickle of blood coming from a nostril, more blood in her hair.  Her eyes don't look right. \nSANDRA Nathan! \nTODD sees NATHAN looking at his mother with fear in his eyes. Struggling to his feet, TODD picks up NATHAN and puts the boy down close to his mother. \nSANDRA reaches out and takes NATHAN's hand.  She holds NATHAN's hand toward TODD. \nTODD looks confused. \nThere are tears in SANDRA's eyes as she pushes NATHAN's little hand into TODD's huge left paw. \nTODD looks down at the joined hands, then he looks into SANDRA's flooded eyes. \nDoes TODD understand her gesture?  His face is impassive.  Maybe he doesn't.  Just then a hand touches his shoulder. \nTODD turns to see JOHNNY face him, trembling but valiant, to ask the question the others are fearful of asking. \nJOHNNY S-sir...sir, are you our friend? (indicating Sandra) Sh-she said you were our friend. \nTODD sees all the CHILDREN looking at him, their eyes big with hope and fear as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DINING COMMONS \nBlackened with soot, JIMMY PIG still has the axe in his hand as SLADE manages, with a supreme effort, to hold the door of the root cellar up enough to allow EMMA and JUDITH to push the FOUR CHILDREN out of the cellar and then to scramble after them. \nExhausted, SLADE lets the door fall back, picks up his rifle and turns toward the exit.  And freezes.  Dumbfounded. \nStanding in the doorway is TODD, laden with CHILDREN, on his shoulders, in his arms, surrounding him, clutching at his garments. \nSLADE You! \nJIMMY PIG Thank God! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR/\"DADDY\" - NIGHT \nCRUDE LETTERS scrawled on the metal skin of the bomb say \"LOVE FROM DADDY.\" \nThe heavy bomb is lugged along a long narrow corridor. \nSLOAN (O.S.) Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon, right?  Now you got one!  A real biggee! \nWe see that RILEY and three other VETERANS -- GREEN, CHESLEY, and MOORE -- are struggling to maneuver the heavy bomb along the narrow corridor and down a ladder hatch as SLOAN follows on their heels and CHURCH and RUBRICK, fretting, follow her. \nRUBRICK What good'll it do just setting it outside?  We don't know where the enemy is. \nCHURCH Doesn't matter.  For once Mekum's on the ball. This is a very dirty bomb!  That wind will churn the radioactivity around like soap in a washing machine.  This is gonna be one clean place in a very short time... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT \na glimpse of RUBRICK being shoved roughly along the corridor by MOORE, his loud protests clearly audible. \nRUBRICK Are you crazy?  You can't do this, soldier!  You're going to be in trouble. \nThen, as RUBRICK is pushed out of view, CHURCH appears, indignant and panicky, as CHESLEY hustles him past. \nCHURCH I'm your superior officer, don't you understand that? \nANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, exchanging glances. \nINT.  CORRIDOR/\"DADDY\" \nAs CHESLEY shoves him along, CHURCH continues to protest... \nCHURCH Don't you realize you're violating the chain of command?  I'm giving you a direct order to...to...to... \nCHURCH breaks off, suddenly speechless at the sight ahead of him. \nHere comes TODD, laden with more CHILDREN, the tattoo on his cheek clearly visible.  His eyes meet CHURCH'S. \nCHURCH S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd? It...  You...!  How...?  How...? \nWeak at the knees, CHURCH is still stammering as CHESLEY shoves him ahead. \nAnd then SLOAN, in the grip of GREEN, is hustled by.  She looks wide-eyed at TODD and the CHILDREN. \nSLOAN Sergeant Todd! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER \nRUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN are still protesting as the VETERANS hustle them down the ladder toward the main hatch. \nRUBRICK Listen, you don't understand!  That bomb is triggered!  It's on a timer! \nCHURCH We have to get out of here!  All of us!  You need us!  You need us to operate the ship... \nSLOAN YOU'RE FUCKING MORONS!  CAN'T YOU DIMWITS GRASP THAT YOU'RE KILLING US ALL!  YOU'RE KILLING YOURSELVES! THERE'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES LEFT! \nRUBRICK NO!  NO!  NO! \nRUBRICK is shoved out the door into the night! \nEXT.  SPACESHIP/\"DADDY\" - NIGHT \nRUBRICK desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage wind tears at him...but he can't hold on. \nAs SLOAN and CHURCH are shoved out the hatch, they see RUBRICK blown off into the night, screaming. \nCHURCH DOWN!  LIE DOWN!  FLAT! \nAnd CHURCH dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him. \nSLOAN does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them, shutting them out of the ship.. \nSLOAN NO!  NO!  NO!  PLEASE!  NO! \nINT.  COCKPIT/\"DADDY\" - NIGHT \nThe countdown clock shows four minutes and twenty seconds as it CLICKS off the seconds. \nTheir soldier faces inscrutable, TODD and RUBRICK consider the various lights winking on the control panel. \nRILEY points to a row of switches and looks at TODD.  Their eyes meet.  TODD considers the switches, then nods. \nRILEY throws the switches.  A row of red lights goes on and the ship seems to hum with life. \nStill communicating wordlessly, TODD points to another switch, RILEY throws it! \nEXT.  SPACESHIP/\"DADDY\" \nBLAST OFF!  Big engines belch fire, illuminating the bleak landscape as the ship rises into the night. \nBrightly lit by the ignition, SLOAN, still on her belly, sees the ship taking off. \nSLOAN OH, MY GOD!  OH, MY GOD! \nCHURCH THERE IT IS!  I SEE IT! \nThe bomb is clearly visible ten yards away in the dying glow of the takeoff. \nCHURCH bumps madly along the ground on his belly. \nEXT.  SPACESHIP/\"DADDY\" \nThe NAF ship \"Daddy\" climbs off into space, getting smaller and smaller, the light from the takeoff diminishing. EXT.  THE BOMB/TERRAIN \nThe countdown timer on the bomb is faintly visible in the dying light.  It reads twenty seconds. \nCHURCH (V.O.) Twenty seconds.  Hurry. \nCHURCH and SLOAN are hunched desperately over the bomb in near darkness, the wind tearing at them.  SLOAN tries to punch a code into the keys... \nSLOAN Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's six-seven or seven-six... \nCHURCH Try one! Try it! \nSLOAN punches the keyboard blindly. \nSLOAN There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did it -- ? \nBAHWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  Everything is dazzling, blinding light! \nINT.

He spots the open door to the bedroom, hurries to it, and disappears. \nSANDRA starts after him, looking worried...but before she gets to the door, MACE reappears with NATHAN safely in his arms. \nMACE If there's any danger to Nathan -- \nSANDRA (interrupting grimly) I won't permit danger to Nathan. \nMACE and SANDRA lock eyes in firm understanding as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WAR SHIP - \"DAY\" \nEXPLOSION!  SCREAMS!  SMOKE!  A SIREN!  We're in some kind of war ship in outer space during a battle. \nThe interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine, cramped even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are awful as SOLDIERS in bulky space suits stumble through thick smoke while a SIREN WHOOPS urgently and wounded SOLDIERS scream in agony. \nWHOOOOM!  Another EXPLOSION!  SCREAMING METAL! \nPart of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind, ripping SOLDIERS out of the hole into space.. \nWe FOCUS ON a soldier in a space suit who's wedged himself behind a cannon.

TODD blinks awake.  He looks around. \nIt's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high window. \nHe can hear SOUNDS...LAUGHTER...coming from beyond the door. \nINT.  OTHER ROOM \nNATHAN is wobbling forward with wide eyes as MACE holds one of his hands and SANDRA holds the other.  They're teaching the child to walk, encouraging each step.  But when they let go, NATHAN totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass. MACE and SANDRA laugh, making the whole thing a game, and NATHAN, after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter.  It's a warm moment until SANDRA, sensing a presence, turns toward the bedroom, suddenly serious. \nMACE follows her look. \nTODD is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg heavily bandaged. \nSANDRA (nervous) You must be...you must be feeling better. \nTODD says nothing.  His eyes flick to NATHAN. \nMACE is watching TODD sharply. \nMACE We're teaching the boy to walk. \nSANDRA (nervously filling silence) He's late learning.  He was sick for a long time. \nTODD says nothing.  His eyes follow MACE who's gone to the corner where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon. \nTODD tenses.  Ready.  Dangerous. \nAs MACE turns toward him, MACE doesn't notice the danger in TODD'S eyes. \nMACE I got something for you. \nHe innocently approaches with the metal rod. \nSuper alert, TODD watches MACE hold the rod out to him. \nMACE Here. \nTODD looks mistrustful. \nMACE Like this. \nMACE demonstrates, using the rod like a cane. MACE See? \nExpressionless, watches MACE use the cane. \nMACE Practice with it.  In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra. \nMACE never even realizes how much danger he was in. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER \nTODD's heavy boots come close to NATHAN, the cane clumps down, just missing him. \nNATHAN looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder at TODD who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help of a cane. \nTODD looks down at NATHAN.  Their eyes meet for a moment.  TODD is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear. \nSANDRA answers a KNOCK at the door, opens it, revealing ELLEN, the ten-year-old, in the doorway.  Behind her are JOHNNY and WILL, as well as several other CHILDREN of various ages. \nELLEN I came for Nathan. \nBut ELLEN's eyes are on TODD and so are the others crowding behind her to peep over her shoulder.  They all want to get a look at TODD, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat shyly. \nSANDRA is wearing a parka too.  She picks up NATHAN from where he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN. \nNATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as ELLEN hugs him and comforts him. \nTODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and soothe his fears at being separated from his mother. \nNothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate him. \nAs ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over- the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD. \nJust then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the bedroom and heads for the door. \nMACE Let's go.  Come on, Sergeant. \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER \nSingle-file, a dozen PIONEERS move along a trench as the wind SCREAMS overhead. \nWe DISCOVER the cane and boots of TODD among them.  The MAN in front of TODD glances back at him occasionally, curious, while MACE and SANDRA walk behind him. \nAs they pass huts, there are windows high in one sloping wall of the trench.  TODD doesn't notice the distorted faces of the CHILDREN peering out at him, their noses pressed against the plexiglass, full of curiosity as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  A JUNCTION OF TRENCHES - DAY \nThree trenches meet.  Some of the PIONEERS move off to the left, some to the right.  MACE is going left, but SANDRA guides TODD toward the right with her. \nSANDRA This way... \nMACE gives her a wave.  He waves at TODD too.  TODD looks confused at the wave, then he salutes. \nMACE is startled by that.  He sort of grins as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  GARDEN - DAY - LATER \nA nasty little snake, a ten-inch VIPER, slithers through the dirt among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until... \nSQUASH!  One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel decapitates the VIPER. \nSANDRA flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel clean in the dirt as TODD watches with those blank snake eyes of his. \nThey're on all fours in a garden.  The garden is simply a much wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated. There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing.  Behind them, kneeling PIONEERS are planting new seedlings and weeding around more mature plants. \nSANDRA turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an offhand glance at the dead VIPER. \nSANDRA You have to watch out for them. They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway.  But they'd make you pretty sick.  Someone smaller...like me, or a child... \nHer meaning clear, SANDRA continues to demonstrate to TODD how to plant the seedling in the earth. \nSANDRA In a month this one will be as big as those. \nTODD follows her look to the other side of the trench where the plants are already eighteen inches high. \nOther PIONEERS, working on their hands and knees also, are sneaking glances as TODD, among them, a middle-aged woman named JUDITH and an older woman, EMMA. \nSANDRA frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects another seedling from a tray and hands it to TODD. \nSANDRA Here.  You try one. \nTODD looks at it.  He doesn't exactly look scared, but he handles it gingerly, seemingly intimidated by the delicate seedling.  He starts to plant it carefully as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DINING COMMONS - EVENING \nJabbering VOICES, the click of utensils.  Heaping plates of food are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal style.  JOHNNY is kicking ELLEN under the table, WILL flips a piece of food at TOMMY when his mother, ILONA, isn't looking, and the outspoken SLADE is lecturing a pioneer named CHESTER. \nSLADE You can't talk to a soldier no more than you can talk to a...a...bomb! Or a bullet!  They're trained, they're killing machines.  They got an objective and they go after that objective and nothing stops them but killing them. \nCHESTER (a glance over his shoulder) Just one?  To kill us all? \nThe conversation gets the attention of JOHNNY and WILL who stop food-fighting to listen to the adults talk. \nSLADE First off, if there's one, there's more.  That's how it is, soldiers travel in bunches.  Second, they don't waste soldiers on folks like us, that's for police!  Training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call \"cost effective.\" \nCHESTER Then who do they fight? \nSLADE Other soldiers!  There's a saying, \"Soldiers deserve soldiers.\" \nANGLE ON ILONA noticing WILL and TOMMY listening. \nILONA Slade, hush up. \nANGLE ON TOMMY and WILL glancing toward the next table. \nANGLE ON THE NEXT TABLE where TODD, wedged between SANDRA and MACE, is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as people jabber all around him. \nANGLE ON JUDITH whispering to EMMA at a nearby table as she watches TODD eat. \nJUDITH You see how much he's eating? \nANGLE ON SLADE who turns now and boldly addresses TODD across the gap between the tables... \nSLADE I don't see how you can not remember how you got here, Sergeant. \nThere's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few urgent whispers and a cough. \nTODD looks up from his food and meets SLADE'S look. \nSANDRA scowls at SLADE as SLADE persists... \nSLADE You're not a deserter, are you... Sergeant? \nThe silence is even more charged than before. \nSANDRA looks alarmed.  Someone coughs.  The tension is unbearable. \nTODD No, sir. \nA sigh of relief from everybody!  But SLADE presses on. \nSLADE Then how come you're not with your unit? \nJIMMY PIG Oh, come on, Slade, let the man eat. \n", "test1_id": 1371, "test2_input": "ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour.  Trouble!  Just what he expected. \nANGLE ON MACE, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward TODD, holding out his free hand for the rifle... \nMACE Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a lot... \nBut MACE breaks off, realizing that TODD'S attention is elsewhere. \nTODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape. \nMACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODD'S looking at. \nANGLE ON THE \"JUNK MOUNTAINS\" in the distance, several miles off, where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient DUMPER SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the junk heaps far below.  The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind. \nCLOSE ON TODD, as realizes how he got here. \nANGLE ON MACE, reacting to TODD'S intense interest. \nMACE Dumpers.  They come every twenty or thirty days. \nAs TODD turns and looks at MACE, MACE puts out his hand again for the gun. \nTODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time. Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to MACE... \nAs MACE casually takes the weapon, the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of relief, grinning again as the tension eases. \nTODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP, fascinated.  So that's what they did to him! \nJust then, JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder. \nJIMMY PIG Thanks, partner.  These no-goods woulda just let me blow away. \nTODD, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at JIMMY PIG like what was that?  Are you hitting me? \nBut all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an attack. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OFFICE (OTHER WORLD) - NIGHT \nA CHRISTMAS TREE!  The corny little tree with plastic needles, blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a foot high.  It's sitting on CHURCH's cluttered desk next to framed photographs of CHURCH's wife and children.  We can hear MEKUM's voice badly transmitted... \nMEKUM (V.O.) Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on Christmas Eve, but I'm off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and I wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep. \nGlowering at the monitor where MEKUM's badly transmitted VIDEO IMAGE is quivering and distorting, CHURCH waves the print-out map he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space. RUBRICK and SLOAN watch as CHURCH addresses MEKUM's image indignantly. \nCHURCH We got it all right.  This is an outpost here, not the Third Army! You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and -- \nMEKUM (interrupting) Piece of cake, guys!  These are totally remote, totally uninhabited territories.  All you do is set down, send out a patrol purely as a formality, then have those veterans of yours put up an A-Type unmanned monitoring unit.  You should be on about number twenty-five by the time I get back from my vacation... \nCHURCH What if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees? \nMEKUM (a frown) Well, you sure as hell don't want to get involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing. (then, meaningfully) My advice would be to...\"avoid paperwork.\" \nCHURCH Eliminate them, you mean. MEKUM Well, no one's out there, but officially these are \"hostile zones.\"  Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as \"hostile,\" I think. But I repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action.  Any other questions before I go? \nCHURCH hesitates.  SLOAN and RUBRICK look at him.  Then CHURCH blurts a question, his voice breaking... \nCHURCH Down there...is it snowing? \nMEKUM (a smirk) Not in the Caribbean.  Have a good Christmas, guys.  See you when I get back. \nMEKUM'S IMAGE disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving a glum silence broken only by the DRUMMING of the rain on the roof. \nCHURCH moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the photographs. \nHis wife and children smile back at him from the pictures. \nJust then SLOAN taps him, and be turns to see her handing him a cup full of amber liquid. \nSLOAN Merry Christmas, Captain. \nRUBRICK is pouring another glass from a bottle of Scotch as the little tree winks on and off, and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT \nSilence.  Darkness.  Dim shapes in the darkness, hard to distinguish. \nRain BEATS on the roof monotonously, relentlessly. \nThe room is alive with BREATHING. \nThen we hear a MUFFLED WHOOP from outside. \nThe darkness is tense, the BREATHING changes rhythm. \nThe RATTLE of the door breaks the quiet. \nThe door swings open, a flashlight stabs the dark. \nA woman GIGGLES:  SLOAN! \nThe flashlight beams and wavers in the darkness, catching brief glimpses of the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS.  Their eyes glitter in the lurching beam, their faces are ghostly like vampires. \nRUBRICK switches on a dim overhead lamp as he and SLOAN (holding the flashlight) and CHURCH stagger drunkenly into the bunkhouse, carrying a couple of half-empty bottles. \nSLOAN Hi, fellas.  At ease! \nRUBRICK Merry Christmas, everybody. \nEyes riveted on the THREE OFFICERS, the NEW SOLDIERS are unresponsive to Christmas cheer.  In fact, they look almost angry, like big dangerous animals, as the three OFFICERS stagger stupidly down the row of bunks, every eye following them. \nCHURCH We brought you a little Christmas tree. \nCHURCH almost falls over as he places the tree on the floor \n", "test2_true": "RUBRICK And some good cheer. \nSLOAN, giggling, does a provocative bump and grind. \nSLOAN How about some Christmas pussy, guys?  Anybody for a quick piece? \nThe NEW SOLDIERS don't react.  Stone faces. RUBRICK (smirking) That's \"conduct unbecoming,\" Sloan. \nSLOAN It's Christmas!  Haven't you heard of piece on earth?  \"Piece on earth,\" get it? \nCHURCH (suddenly serious, sober) Christ, I wish we were on Earth. \nRUBRICK sets three bottles down and indicates them to the NEW SOLDIERS. \nRUBRICK Eat, drink, and be merry, men.  For tomorrow you go on patrol in the \"hostile zone.\" \nRUBRICK burps stupidly as the NEW SOLDIERS stare back at him from their bunks, muscles bulging, eyes glittering, nothing but danger in their stone faces as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PIONEER MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \n\"JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE ALL THE WAY.\"  In sharp contrast to the gloom of the soldier Christmas, the PIONEERS, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, are SINGING and celebrating. \nThere's a six-foot carved wooden tree festooned with makeshift decorations and ringed with heaps of presents in crude wrapping. \nThere's an appetizing looking buffet and a punchbowl. \nANGLE ON TODD seated against a wall not far from the door.  He stares uncomprehendingly at the merriment all around him.  What on earth is going on?  What are they doing? \nJIMMY PIG is marching around in a Santa Claus costume, doling out presents to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY and OTHER CHILDREN. \nJIMMY PIG HO HO HO!  HO HO HO! \nPassing TODD, JIMMY PIG acknowledges him with a wink and a special \"HO HO HO.\" \nTODD'S eyes give away his confusion.  What the fuck is this? JIMMY PIG in a fake beard and a fake stomach?  This is the craziest shit TODD has ever encountered. \nANGLE ON NATHAN, a wrapped present in hand.  He hasn't a clue what it is or what he should do with it. \nLaughing, MACE and SANDRA hover over him, showing him how to pull the wrapping off.  Great idea!  NATHAN likes pulling wrapping off!  That's fun.  SANDRA and MACE watch joyfully as NATHAN tears at the wrapping enthusiastically. \nANGLE ON TODD getting to his feet. \nANGLE ON NATHAN pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a pull toy, a METAL BIRD on crude wheels made of wire and junk. \nMACE takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it.  The wings flap as the wheels turn! \nNATHAN reacts with delight and amazement!  Then grabs it! \nA SUDDEN SCREECH... \nANGLE ON TODD looking alarmed.  He's on his way to the door, but EMMA is charging at him, SHRIEKING!!! \nNot sure whether this is an attack or not, TODD watches the older woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still SHRIEKING giddily. \nAs TODD eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a peck on the cheek and points over head. \nTODD looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it that says \"MISTLETOE.\" \nMeans nothing to TODD.  There's a burst of applause as EMMA scrambles off the stool.  Somebody starts to sing \"GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN.\" \nA MONTAGE OF FACES:  JIMMY \"SANTA\" PIG, MACE, SANDRA, RED, CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING. \nANGLE ON THE DOOR.  No sign of TODD!  Gone! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  \"ROOF\" - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER \nA low wind MOANS and mingles with strains of \"OH, HOLY NIGHT\" as TODD bellies up to the \"skylight\" and peers down at the scene below in the Meeting Room. \nTODD'S POV THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT.  The merriment has evolved into a more spiritual mood as the PIONEERS join in the solemn hymn. \nBut TODD spots NATHAN trying to pull his pull toy along so the wings flap.  NATHAN is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and starts to cry. \nImmediately SANDRA disengages from the adults and rushes to the sobbing NATHAN and clutches him to her breast, soothing him...and MACE joins her, hovering over his son. \nANGLE ON TODD, watching.  After a moment, TODD scrambles off the roof and drops into the adjoining trench while \"OH, HOLY NIGHT\" continues to blend with the soughing WIND. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH \nLit by spill from a window in the wall of the trench, TODD starts doing push-ups.  One-two-three-four-five-six-fast-fast-fast-fast. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR AND MEETING ROOM/SETTLEMENT - (ANOTHER) DAY \nHAWKINS is walking along the corridor outside the meeting room when she hears strange SOUNDS.  She approaches the door and looks in. \nELLEN and other CHILDREN (including NATHAN) are playing children's games on the floor, paying no attention to the source of the strange noises...JOHNNY and WILL. \nJOHNNY and WILL are doing exercises, obviously inspired by TODD's martial calisthenics, and including the sudden violent movements. \nAs the two boys make their ritual grunting noises, HAWKlNS frowns a worried frown, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TRENCH GARDEN - DAY \nThe seedlings have grown to twelve-inch stalks.  SANDRA is pulling some from the ground as TODD imitates her.  She shows him the fat edible root. \nSANDRA We'll eat these. \nOther PIONEERS are also harvesting, with occasional glances at TODD as we... \n", "test2_id": 1372, "test3_input": "RED (dampened) They stopped shooting! \nJIMMY PIG (to Red) Give us a hand, dammit! \nAs RED joins the effort.  SLADE snaps at him sarcastically as he strains against the heavy beam. \nSLADE You think (grunt) that's good they stopped?  It means (grunt) they're comin' for us!  To (grunt) kill us! That's good news, you think? \nSANDRA (looking for hope) Sergeant Todd (grunt, cough) said... \nSLADE That he's gonna (grunt) stomp a whole army?  Couldn't if he wanted. \nThe smoke is getting thicker.  EMMA and JUDITH are coughing, looking scared. \nSANDRA He (grunt) knew them!  He said -- \nSLADE He's dead!  If he isn't (grunt) dead, he joined 'em.  He don't (grunt) care about us, he's a soldier.  Besides, we threw him out, remember? \nSANDRA pushes at the beam with all her strength, fighting back tears of despair. \nSANDRA He's not dead! \nThe massive beam won't budge!  Eyes wide with terror, EMMA and RUTH peer out of their trap. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  COCKPIT/\"DADDY\" - NIGHT \nCHURCH is in the cockpit now, hovering behind RUBRICK who's speaking urging into the radio mike. \nRUBRICK This is Daddy, come in, Number Two. Daddy calling Number Two... \nCHURCH What about Number One?  Try Number... \nRUBRICK I tried One.  I can't get either one of them. \nSLOAN is pacing, looks sick to her stomach with fear. \nSLOAN There was...some kind of... guerilla action... \nRUBRICK Then we lost them... \nNow CHURCH is pacing back and forth, panicky, ranting... \nCHURCH You should have waked me sooner! This is bad, very bad.  I never should have let that clown Mekum test his wonder boy army on me.  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Shit!  We don't even know what we're up against.  How many...? \nSLOAN We couldn't get any figures on enemy troop strength. \nRUBRICK Not even estimates... \nCHURCH We're sitting ducks here!  There could be a couple of divisions! More!  We don't even have the weapons to arm the old soldiers. \nRUBRICK (into the mike, desperately) Hello...  Hello, One. This is Daddy... \nEXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH GARDEN \nThe radio in CRAWLER TWO is still SQUAWKING urgently with RUBRICK'S VOICE as the crippled vehicle lies sprawled at a violent angle over the trench garden. \nRADIO (V.O.) This is Daddy!  Come in, Crawler Two, come in... \nNearby, A VOICE is crying out in pain in the night. \nLimping, TODD keeps his weapon ready as he searches out the sound. \nANGLE ON THE INJURED SOLDIER, the one TODD crushed under the treads of the CRAWLER.  He's screaming in pain.  Looks up. \nTODD looms over the INJURED SOLDIER, weapon pointed.  Their eyes meet. \nIn agony, the SOLDIER looks into TODD'S eyes, nods ever so slightly. \nBLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires point blank. \nNow the only sound is the ROARING of the WIND and the pathetic sound of RUBRICK continuing his desperate RADIO BABBLE. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH GARDEN \nAs the RADIO CHATTERS, burning debris from the CRAWLER canted over the garden illuminates the garden...and a BODY sprawled there, fallen from the CRAWLER above. \nBAM!  KABAM!  ROCKET FIRE! \nEXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH \nTODD FIRES rockets into the damaged CRAWLER...until the RADIO CHATTER stops abruptly.  RADIO killed dead. \nCUT TO: INT.  DINING COMMONS/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT \nThe gap between the floor and the trap door has increased to ten inches, enough for EMMA and RUTH to squeeze an INFANT through to SANDRA'S reaching arms. \nSoaked with sweat, gasping and coughing in the thickening smoke, JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED continue to strain at the beam...and it moves.  Another inch! \nThe fire is raging.  The INFANT SQUALLS in SANDRA'S arms.  SLADE snaps at her as he pushes on the beam. \nSLADE Get them kids (grunt) hid somewhere! There's soldiers coming. \nELLEN and the CHILDREN look alarmed as SANDRA gathers them and ushers them toward the exit, glancing back toward the trap door as she's leaving. \nEMMA and RUTH meet her look with frightened eyes. \nNoticing SANDRA'S hesitation, JIMMY PIG reassures her... \nJIMMY PIG Don't worry.  Couple more inches and they're out. \nSANDRA and the CHILDREN exit. \nAnd suddenly!!!  The beam slips back five inches, almost closing the opening.  EMMA and JUDITH SCREAM! \nJIMMY PIG, RED and SLADE look alarmed, defeated. \n", "test3_true": "TODD walks away from the smoking bulk of the CRAWLER canted over the garden and drops into a traveling trench. \nEXT.  INSIDE A PASSAGE TRENCH \nLimping slightly, laden with weapons and still wearing his helmet, TODD starts along the trench in the direction of the settlement. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH GARDEN \nIn the shadows six feet below the overturned and smoldering CRAWLER TWO, the BODY stirs on the floor of the garden, barely visible in the flickering half light from the flames above. \nIt's CAINE 607.  He groans and stirs again.  He's not dead!  In fact, he's rolling over, struggling to his knees. \nINT.  DINING COMMONS \nThe frightened eyes of EMMA, RUTH and CHILDREN peer from the four inch crack. \nWhipped by wind from the hole in the ceiling, the fire is spreading, the smoke is thick.  JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED are gasping with effort and coughing.  SLADE gasps to RED. \nSLADE You know where Thomas keeps those two axes?  Go get the axes. \nRED takes off at a run. \nJIMMY PIG (so Emma and Ruth can't hear) We can't (cough) chop 'em out.  We don't have time. \nSLADE Just as good (gasp) to die chopping as fighting. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nRED rushes through a smoky corridor.  Wherever shells have punctured the roof, the WIND whips debris about. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE GARDEN TRENCH \nSitting up now, using a flashlight, CAINE 607 is examining a terrible gash in his thigh that reveals tissue and tendon.  The right side of his face is also badly injured, flesh torn, swollen and distorted. \nHe pulls the first aid kit from his utility belt, opens it, focuses the light on the contents. \nSelects a couple of pills.  Swallows them.  Considers.  Takes two more.  Pulls out a hypodermic needle, injects his leg.  Takes another needle, stabs his bloody cheek. \nHis eyes glitter as he feels the rush from the drug.  He looks dangerous again in spite of his condition. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE PASSAGE TRENCH \nTODD reaches the settlement, enters a half collapsed doorway. \nINT.  SUPPLY ROOM \nRED is urgently rummaging through crowbars, coils of rope, sledge hammers.  At last he finds two axes, grabs them and exits. INT.  CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT \nTODD picks his way among collapsed walls, fallen timbers. \nHe peers through doorways, sees CORPSES. \nMoves on.  Searching. \nEXT.  INSIDE THE PASSAGE TRENCH \nDragging a freshly bandaged leg, CAINE 607 makes his way along the trench toward the settlement.  He's using the wall for support...but he seems to be getting stronger rather than weaker. His face is hideous. INT.  JUNCTION OF CORRIDORS \nCarrying two axes RED zips around a corner and freezes... \nRED'S POV of: A SOLDIER, seen from behind, moving down a smoky corridor, helmeted, heavily armed, dangerous looking, unidentifiable. \nANGLE ON RED, terrified, waiting till the SOLDIER (TODD) has disappeared in the smoke.  Then RED hurries on down another damaged corridor, axes in hand. \nINT.  OTHER DAMAGED CORRIDOR \nRED scoots around another corner and... stops short...an armored torso a foot in front of his face. \nLooking up, RED looks right into the distorted face of CAINE 607. \nBefore RED can react, CAINE 607'S hand shoots out and snatches one of the axes. \nAstonished, RED backs up a step, and raises the other axe to defend himself. \nRED'S POV OF CAINE 607 looming toward him, axe in hand. \nANGLE ON RED, turning and running. \nANGLE ON CAINE 607 limping along, dragging his leg as RED disappears around a corner. \nCAINE 607 rounds the corner in pursuit... and see only smoke, no sign of RED. \nINT.  DINING COMMONS \nEMMA and JUDITH peer out from under the heavy metal trap door as JIMMY PIG and SLADE desperately try to move the beam using a piece of metal as a lever. \nSLADE This (grunt, cough) ain't gonna work.  Where's them axes?  He musta run into soldiers and got killed. \nJIMMY PIG How do you know there's soldiers coming? \nSLADE 'Cause soldiers (gasp) finish what they start -- unless you stop 'em. And we're what (gasp) they started, and we didn't stop 'em! (shouts to Emma) WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUTTA THERE SOMEHOW!  I SWEAR IT! \nJust then RED bursts into the room with a single axe, shouting... RED SOLDIERS!  SOLDIERS! SLADE (grabbing the axe) Only one axe? \nRED They took the other one! \nSLADE (chopping furiously) Toldja. \nJIMMY PIG (to Red) How many? \nRED I... I couldn't... I couldn't... count 'em.  Four, I think.  Maybe five. \nSLADE (chopping) More!  Trust me! \nJIMMY PIG (grabbing the axe) Turns. \n", "test3_id": 1373}

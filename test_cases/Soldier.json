{"test1_input": "Tiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along a cable, headed away from the junk mountain. \nAt ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of its great bulk. \nPeeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of \"his\" mountain.  The cable is twenty yards away in a \"canyon\" of junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed to the wind in order to get to it. \nHe starts out from behind the transformer... \nWHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet, his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable, struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights the wind, struggles toward the cable. \nSuddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time as it whistles close to his head. \nTODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl \"under the wind,\" toward the taut cable, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  \"STEEL HENGE\" - DUSK - LATER \nSeen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing in the distance and the dusk. \nFollowing them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him, vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must have crashed long ago. \nThe mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long way, it's almost dark, he's weak. \nHe hangs onto the wire, walking with effort. \nHe can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire. \nHe notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right. \nSteel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery. \nJust then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze. \nThen the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire and get weakly to his feet.  For a moment he looks like he might collapse, but he doesn't, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LANDSCAPE - NIGHT \nAt night the four suns glow darkly like night lights. \nTODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind, struggling along the wire, shivering. \nEvery stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing something ahead. \nIn the distance a faint light glows. \nTODD considers it as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded in a low mound of \"earth\" like a skylight.  Whatever is making the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only inches above the ground. \nTODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind. \nTODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten yards to the window and pears through it. \nTODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the wind. \n(What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.) \nANGLE ON TODD, prone on the \"roof,\" mystified.  He's never seen anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the wind. \nThe ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first arrived has diminished to a strong breeze. \nTODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He looks around. \nThe meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on the other window/skylight that glows from this strange \"roof\" and on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze... a MUSICAL sound. \nStruggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion. \nTODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window. \nTODD'S POV through the second \"window,\" another mysterious vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is just as puzzled. \nWhat he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music... \nANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights. \nThen he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he freezes...listening! \nA strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere... \nTODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows. There's nothing visible... \nThe mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything. \nSuddenly TODD understands, but he's too late... \nROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more powerful than ever! \nTODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind, struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed violently, somersaulted helplessly... \nEXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH \nWHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons that aren't clear. \nFinally he rolls over weakly and looks up. \nIn the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him from the wind howling overhead. \nTODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and injured even to crawl. \nLying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly sees something. \n", "test1_true": "He manages to lift his head a little and look up. \nSilhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and JOHNNY, eight. \nBarely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nVOICES, CONFUSION.  About fifty people are jammed into the low- ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once.  They are PIONEERS, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy, weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color. \nTheir faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines, the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet around the eyes from squinting. \nAs they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman, HAWKINS, is standing behind a table in the front of the room, calling for order. \nHAWKINS Please!  Quiet, please! \nJust as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named SLADE bellows loudly at her. \nSLADE Just tell me one thing!  How many of them are there and are they armed? \nHAWKINS stares SLADE down, refusing to speak until she has real silence.  When she finally speaks, her voice is calm and controlled. \nHAWKINS There in a man...one man.  He was found in the trench by several children... \nA sudden murmur dies away quickly under HAWKINS' hard stare. HAWKINS This man was not armed. \nA murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named ELISE speaks over the hum of voices... \nELISE How could there only be one?  How could he get here? \nHAWKINS glances toward MACE, a muscular, bearded man, about thirty. \nMACE He was unconscious.  We couldn't ask him anything.  He -- \nA commotion in the back room causes MACE to break off as JIMMY PIG, a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes his way in, followed by four more PIONEERS.  All five of then are wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange Eskimo-type wind goggles, and carrying weapons. \nJIMMY PIG Nothin' out there.  We couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's up again real strong. \nAn excited hubbub.  HAWKINS is trying to restore order when SLADE shouts over the commotion. \nSLADE They're hiding, I bet. \nHAWKINS ignores him as she speaks with firm authority. \nHAWKINS Let's everybody calm down right now! (beat; silence; then) We have an injured man among us. One man.  A traveler.  Unarmed. (another pause; then) We all want to do the decent thing. The decent thing is to help him. Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking after him now.  Now, I'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you. \nThe way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and, in fact, PIONEERS are exchanging glances and nodding when SLADE shouts again. \nSLADE You keep an eye on him, Mace!  You watch him! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTODD is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom.  He stares stupidly at the woman bending over him.  She is SANDRA, a woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous way.  It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and dignity.  She's wiping away blood and grease from TODD's face. \nTODD's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless. \nHe sees a window high on one wall. \nHe sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned material hung here and there for decoration. \nClothing hangs from pegs on the walls. \nHe doesn't see the look in SANDRA's eyes as she discovers the savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his cheek.  Eyeing these telltale marks, SANDRA pours liquid into a spoon and holds it to his lips. \nSANDRA Want to try some more of this? \nTODD swallows weakly. \nSANDRA smiles, stands up, moves toward the door. \nSANDRA You rest now.  I'll give you more later. \nTODD watches her exit. \nHe hears her VOICE in the next room...a low murmur. \nHe's looking around again when a NOISE makes him look back toward the door. \nA two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees.  The baby boy, NATHAN, stops just inside, seeing TODD in the bed. \nNATHAN looks into TODD's eyes with childlike interest and wonder. TODD meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes. \nINT.  \"LIVING ROOM\" \nA second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the Mace/Sandra/Nathan living quarters.  MACE and SANDRA are deep in conversation. \nMACE What do you mean he's survived worse?  Did he say something? \nSANDRA No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars.  Knife scars, bullet scars, burns. \nMACE (worried) A soldier! \nSANDRA There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai \nMACE The Tannhauser Gate was a battle... \nMACE and SANDRA look into each other's eyes, very worried.

OTHER ROOM - DAY \nCleaning vegetables, SANDRA is separating the roots, shaking the dirt off, cutting away the excess. \nTODD is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away with the knife. \nNATHAN is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs. \nSANDRA It seemed like he was never going to walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's an expert. \nWhump!  NATHAN falls on his ass. \nSANDRA (a laugh) Well, not quite an expert. \nTODD watches SANDRA go to NATHAN and hug him affectionately. \nTurning back to the vegetables, stone faced, TODD cuts his finger.  Blood flows.  He ignores it, continues working... \nBut SANDRA, returning to the vegetables, notices TODD's cut finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand. \nTODD looks startled is she takes his finger.  Then, staunching the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious. \nSANDRA Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier? \nWhat's it like...?  TODD stares at her, trying to process the question.  Seeing his difficulty SANDRA tries to help... \nSANDRA What do you think about? \nNo answer, a stare. \nSANDRA Do you think about food?  Or women? You must think about something. \nTODD gulps.  His blank stare could pass for stupidity. \nSANDRA What about feelings then?  You must have feelings.  You must feel something. \nTODD wets his lips.  He seems about to answer...and yet it's difficult for him.  He could kill a person easier. \nOn the floor NATHAN GOOS happily, oblivious. \nTODD (at last) Fear. \nSANDRA (startled) Fear!  You mean...you feel afraid? (as he nods) That's when you're in battle... What about other times?  Now, for example? \nTODD Fear. \nSANDRA (amazed) Now? \nTODD Always. \nA stunned silence.  Finally SANDRA speaks... \nSANDRA You don't...look afraid.  You look fearless. \nTODD looks at her.  This is incredibly difficult for him, like physical labor.  He wets his lips and take a breath. \nTODD Fear and...discipline. \nSANDRA (growing horror) Oh, my God.  But there's nothing to be afraid of here.  I can't hurt you.  I wouldn't. \nTODD Always.  It makes us...alert. \nSANDRA is overwhelmed.  She reaches for him, hugs him to her breast like a little baby, holding him. \nBut TODD is as tense in her arms as steel.  He can't relax.  He's even trembling. \nNATHAN, on the floor, looks up, smiles innocently. \nSANDRA lets go of TODD and steps back, looking at him, her face troubled, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY \nELLEN is supervising block building (babysitting) with several of the younger children (OMAR, BUCKY, ANGIE and JANICE) while WILL and TOMMY play their own separate games close by.  Then WILL looks up and sees something disturbing. \nWILL You're not supposed to do that anymore. \nHe's speaking to JOHNNY who is doing martial exercises. \nJOHNNY So what?  I'm a soldier. \nWILL They're gonna kick him out. \nELLEN looks up from the blocks. \nELLEN They can't kick him out... \nWILL They're gonna.  My father -- \nELLEN (interrupting strongly) My mother says when someone's sick or hurt, you have to help them.  You don't have a choice. \nJOHNNY (getting interested) Yeah, but what if the hurt person is...evil? \nELLEN You still have to help them... because if you don't, you're evil! \nWILL (importantly) My father says...uh...he says, \"Soldiers deserve soldiers.\" \nTOM Yeah.  That's what my father said too. \nELLEN My father's making Sergeant Todd a scarf because he saved his life one time.  He's knitting it. WILL That's dumb.  Your father's dumb. \nWILL is smirking with satisfaction at having settled that when out of nowhere ELLEN's little fist hits him hard on the nose. WILL looks stunned.  Blood oozes from his nose.

Slowly he lowers JIMMY PIG to the floor. \nAll JIMMY PIG can do is squeak desperately and point to the floor. \nJIMMY PIG Scarf!  Scarf! \nTODD looks down.  He sees a knit scarf lying on the floor.  He doesn't understand.  He looks up. \nHe sees JIMMY PIG'S WIFE, HAWKINS, SLADE, and several other PIONEERS standing in the doorway of the meeting room, their stunned expressions indicating they just saw something horrifying. \nTODD stands there, isolated, bare-chested, his huge muscles glistening with sweat, decorated with terrible scars and mysterious tattoos, as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.

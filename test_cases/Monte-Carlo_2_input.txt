JEAN-PIERRE 
BUT-- 
ALICE We're very sorry-- 
JEAN-PIERRE 
(MOUNTING ANXIETY) Perhaps we have misunderstood each other. Mademoiselle Scott--. She must be there for tonight's game. The prince. His Highness has asked to be seated across from her-- 
EMMA What's he saying? Which prince? Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three. 
JEAN-PIERRE Please. It is for the foundation. 
INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY 
Within a glossy brochure: A collage of "snapshots" shows happy African children grouped outside their new school; raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom; finding their country on a glossy globe. 
ALICE 
(ANGUISHED) Oh, would you look at these kids? 
MEG No, I can't. I can't stand it. Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay. 
EMMA "With your help The Michand Foundation is able to sow the seeds of education, transforming lives, families, and villages, one child at a time..." She didn't say anything about a school! 
MEG Schools, with an "s." More than one.

ALICE 
(MISERABLE) In Africa. 
MEG That horrible, irresponsible girl! I've never stolen a thing in my life, now I've taken a trip from school children. 
ALICE In Africa. Meg hangs her head. 
EMMA Reykjavik! That takes some nerve! They're counting on her for a charity auction and she doesn't even show up! 
ALICE Only she did. Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket. 
EMMA She did? 
MEG Do not touch that! 
ALICE You, Emma. If you're Cordelia. They've seen you. You're here. 
EMMA Well, I can't go to that thing tonight. 
(A BEAT) I don't have anything to wear. The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can. 
EMMA (CONT'D) 
(PERFECT BRITISH) Hello? Alice gestures for Emma not to say anything, to hang up.

EMMA (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Oh yes, please. Send it up... Um. Yes, all of it. Everything. Thank you, ever so. Merci! She hangs up and holds a beat before turning to Alice. 
EMMA (CONT'D) My luggage is here. 
INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY 
Alice and Meg stand in front of the tower of Louis Vuitton trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock of a steel briefcase in her lap. 
ALICE Okay. But, just for tonight. And, that's it. CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open briefcase, eyes wide. 
EMMA Lucky guess? 
A necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles like a constellation from within the case's velvet lining. 
ALICE 
(CLOSING IT) No jewelry. Emma nods. 
ALICE (CONT'D) Then it.all goes back. 
MEG Dry-cleaned. 
INT. LES CASINO DES MONTE CARLO - NIGHT 
The gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza. Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the tony European jet set.

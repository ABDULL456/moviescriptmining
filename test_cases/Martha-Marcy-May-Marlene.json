{"train": "MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE \nWritten by \nSean Durkin \nEXT. FARM - DAY \nIt is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley. \nTWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock. \nTHREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden. \nTWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line. \nTWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car. \nFOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The others knit a large blanket. \nTWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole. \nA MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading. \nA MAN chops wood. \nA bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway. \nINT. FARM HOUSE - DAY \nA large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor. \nTWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food. \nMARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen. \nINT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING \nThe men sit around a table eating dinner. \nOne man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK. Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard. \nINT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk outside. \nThe women file into the dining room, clear the men's dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a new serving of food. \nINT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nThe kitchen is filled with dishes. \nTWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib. \nPeople are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly, a figure passes quickly through frame. \nEXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nMartha doesn't answer. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Your boyfriend? \nMartha nods. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Did he hurt you? \nMARTHA No! \nLUCY Are you sure? \nMARTHA No. I'm fine. \nLucy is skeptical. \nLUCY Did you guys break up? \nMartha nods. \nLUCY (CONT'D) How long were you together? \nMARTHA A while. \nLUCY How long? \nMARTHA I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or less. \nLUCY And you were here the whole time? \nMartha nods. \nLUCY (CONT'D) You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me? \nMARTHA I'm sorry. \nLucy is upset but manages to remain calm. \nLUCY Well, I'm glad you're here now. \nINT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nLucy makes the bed. Martha enters the room wrapped in a towel. Her hair drips on the floor. \nLUCY I made you some tea. \nMARTHA Thanks. \nLucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair. \nLUCY Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner. \nMARTHA I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed? \nLUCY Of course. (BEAT) Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow. \nLucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her wet towel. \nINT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE. The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters. He speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT. He sets down his bag and gives her a hug and a kiss. \nTED Well? \nLUCY Well I love it. \nLucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha. \nMARTHA It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake. \nLUCY Yeah. Do you still like to swim? \nMARTHA You don't live in the city anymore? \nLUCY We do. This is for weekends and holidays. \nTed and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments. You want to see pictures? \nLucy gets up from the table and walks to another room. Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice. \nTED (TO MARTHA) Do you think she's excited to have you back? \nLucy re-enters with her digital camera. \nLUCY This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right? (MORE) \nLUCY (CONT'D) We were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer. \nTED (SARCASTIC) Yep, just a little while longer. \nLUCY Okay, sorry, no more work talk. \nLucy notices that Martha isn't eating. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Aren't you hungry? \nMARTHA Not really, sorry. \nTED Well, you've got to eat. \nLUCY It's okay, I can fix you something later. \nMartha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite. \nEXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY \nMartha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the lake. Ted naps while Lucy sun bathes reading THE MOTHER OF ALL BABY BOOKS. \nMARTHA Where are we? \nLUCY Connecticut. \nMARTHA How far are we? \nLUCY From what? \nMARTHA Yesterday. \nLucy is confused. She tries to make sense of the question. \nLUCY You mean where I picked you up? \nMartha nods. \nLUCY (CONT'D) About 3 hours. (BEAT) Why? \nPATRICK Well, there you go. \nHe continues to walk through the field. Zoe and Martha recline into the grass and continue talking. \nTED (O.S.) I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join? \nMARTHA Sure. \nMartha stands up and brushes herself off. \nMARTHA (CONT'D) You coming? \nEXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - CONTINUOUS \nMartha turns to Zoe but Lucy is there instead, lying on the sun bed, lost in her book. Lucy does not answer. \nTed runs down the dock and dives into the water. Martha follows. Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked. \nMartha swims, lost in her own world. \nLucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out. \nTED (SMIRKING) Brilliant choice of swim wear. \nLucy is not amused. Ted walks away laughing. He turns to sneak one more glimpse of Martha. \nLUCY Martha! What are you doing? \nMARTHA What? \nLUCY Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked. \nMARTHA Why? \nLUCY You just can't. There are kids around and people come by. \nMARTHA So? \nLUCY So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow. \nMartha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels embarrassed. \nINT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON \nMartha sleeps. Lucy notices the bruising on Martha's ear. \nLUCY Martha! (BEAT) I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night. \nMartha wakes up. \nLUCY (CONT'D) You should eat. \nMARTHA I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay? \nLUCY Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before. \nMARTHA It's okay. \nLucy leaves. Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta outside then goes back to sleep. \nINT. LAKE HOUSE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTED She's not coming? \nKATIE It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family. \nKatie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around. \nKATIE (CONT'D) We sell blankets in town. We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again. \nMARTHA When do you think that'll happen? \nKATIE Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash. \nMARTHA That'll be nice. \nKatie accidentally drops a plate. \nKATIE Shoot. \nMartha gets down and starts to clean it up. \nEXT. FARM - DAY \nMartha, Watts, Max, Zoe and a few others sit around and listen to two men play guitar. Everyone is talking and laughing and having a nice time. \nPatrick approaches. He observes everyone for a moment, he seems agitated. He speaks above everyone and above the music. \nPATRICK How's everything going so far Marcy May? \nMARTHA Good. \nThe guys stop playing music. \nPATRICK You like it here? \nMARTHA Yeah, it's really nice. \nPATRICK I want you to feel at home. \nMARTHA I do. Thanks. \nPATRICK People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone. \nMARTHA What? \nPATRICK If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down. \nMartha is embarrassed and feels on the spot. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) It's not your fault, but it's there. If you feel safe here, and I think you do, let us in. We just want to help you. \nZOE Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome. \nPATRICK If you're going to live here then really be apart of things. \nINT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING \nLucy is putting away groceries. Martha enters. \nLUCY Good morning. How are you feeling today? \nMARTHA Good. \nLUCY There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices. (MORE) \nLUCY (CONT'D) This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you. \nLUCY She's not that bad. \nMARTHA You never had to live with her. \nTED You lived with Dora? \nMARTHA She lived with me after mom died. \nTED (TO LUCY) Where were you? \nLUCY College. \nLucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay. \nMARTHA (SMILING) She hates me. \nLUCY She doesn't hate you. (BEAT) Look at me. \nMARTHA I hate her. \nMartha notices the camera and quickly turns away. \nLUCY Relax, I don't have any pictures of you. (LUCY FOCUSES) Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying. \nMartha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot. \nLUCY (CONT'D) There you go! \nLucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Don't shake it, that's a myth. \nMartha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the Polaroid. \nMARTHA Is it true married people don't fuck? \nLUCY What? No! \nTed walks back to the front of the boat and looks at Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She stares at the Polaroid. \nINT. LAKE HOUSE/TED AND LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nMartha sits on the bed watching Lucy go through her closet looking at old clothes. Lucy holds up a summer dress. \nLUCY Put this on. \nMARTHA You're kidding. \nLUCY Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it. \nMARTHA Why does it matter? \nLUCY It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable. \nMartha slips on the dress and a funny pose. \nLUCY (CONT'D) It looks good you little shit. \nMARTHA Whatever makes you happy mama bear. \nLUCY You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good. \nMARTHA Really? \nZOE Yeah, it's so special. \nMARTHA I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain - \nZOE That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins. \nMartha is distant. \nZOE (CONT'D) You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish. \nMARTHA I'm not. \nZOE So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once. \nZoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They curl up together in a very intimate way. \nMartha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is caught off guard.

Patrick, who sits in the back, stands up and walks up to the stage. Everyone gets excited. \nHe tunes his guitar. \nPATRICK This one's called Marcy's song. \nMartha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play. \nThe song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song. The whole group is entranced.

LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMartha turns her head to see Lucy instead of Katie.

Martha takes the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the couch in front of the television. \nTed walks into the kitchen.

Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy. \nMartha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha. \nLUCY You could have killed him. \nMartha backs away. \nMARTHA I was confused. \nLUCY About what, what are you so confused about? \nMARTHA I thought he was someone else. \nLucy's anger is building. \nLUCY You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you? (BEAT) I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on. \nMARTHA I'm sorry. \nLUCY You need help Martha. \nMARTHA I know. \nLUCY What happened to you? \nMartha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her eyes. \nLUCY (CONT'D) What happened to you? \nMARTHA (SCREAMING) I don't know. \nLucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is too far gone. \nLUCY We're going to get you proper help. \nThere is a long moment of silence. \nMARTHA Are you going to send me away? \nLUCY I don't know how to help you anymore. \nMARTHA (PLEADING) Please don't. Please don't. \nLUCY I can't help you. \nMARTHA Please, I can't be alone, please. \nLUCY We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here. \nLucy walks away. \nMARTHA Lucy? \nLUCY What? \n", "test1_input": "LUCY What do you mean?

DINER - DAY \nMartha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days. \nThe entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They are seated. Martha returns to eating. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Marcy May? \nIt is Watts. His voice paralyzes her. \nWATTS What are you doin'? \nMartha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits across from her. \nWatts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him. \nWATTS (CONT'D) We were worried about you. \nMARTHA I'm fine. \nWATTS Patrick's worried about you. \nMARTHA I just wanted to come into town. \nWATTS I could've brought you. \nMARTHA I wanted to walk. \nWATTS Through the woods? \nWAITRESS (TO WATTS) Can I get you something? \nWATTS No. \nWAITRESS (TO MARTHA) You done? \nMARTHA Yeah. \nThe waitress goes to take Martha's plate.

The waitress clears the plate. \nWatts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews. \nWATTS (CONT'D) You ready to go? \nMartha doesn't respond. \nWATTS (CONT'D) Come on! \nMARTHA Not right now. \n", "test1_true": "The waitress drops the check on the table. \nWatts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed. \nWATTS (CONT'D) I'll get this. \nHe lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces eye contact with her. \nWatts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to make a scene in front of all these people. \nHe leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips. \nMartha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen. \nEXT. BUS STOP - LATER \nMartha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at an empty bus stop. She does not look well. She turns and vomits behind the bench. \nEXT. BUS STOP - LATER \nMartha hides between two parked buses. She watches a BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. Martha walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha. \nINT.

LAKE - SUNSET \nMartha sits alone on the steps looking out onto the water. She is deep in thought. Lucy walks down the stairs and sits next to her. \nMARTHA Shouldn't we start cooking? \nLUCY I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish. \nMARTHA I thought we were going to cook. \nLUCY We cooked last night. \nMARTHA Oh, yeah. \nMartha is lost deep in thought. \nMARTHA (CONT'D) Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed? \nLUCY Not really. \nBeat. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Do you blame me for anything? \nMARTHA No. (BEAT) Like what? \nLUCY I don't know. (BEAT) I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking. \nMARTHA I didn't think about it. \nLUCY Really? \nMARTHA We were far apart. \nLUCY Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you. \nMARTHA (MUMBLES) The past doesn't matter. \nLUCY It does matter. \nMARTHA I took care of myself. \nLUCY I know you did. I think I could have done more though. \nMARTHA Stop it. \nLUCY Be honest with me, you never think about it? \nMARTHA No. \nLUCY You're not angry at me? \nMARTHA I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do. \nLUCY No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential. \nMARTHA I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am. \nLUCY Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about?

People don't need careers, people should just exist. \nTed laughs. \nLUCY He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together. \nTED I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way. \nMARTHA You can do that if you want to. \nTED It's not that simple. \nMARTHA (CAUTIOUSLY) It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live. \nLucy is floored by Martha's response. \nTED And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude. \nMartha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands up to Ted. \nMARTHA You don't know anything about it. \nTed and Lucy are speechless. Martha leaves. \nINT.

A WOMAN picks up. \nWOMAN Hello...Hello. \n", "test2_id": 118, "test3_input": "There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay. \nPATRICK You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

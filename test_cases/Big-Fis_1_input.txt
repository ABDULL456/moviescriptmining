Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10 miles." 
INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING 
Will checks the address on one of his father's files. 
EXT. ASHTON GAS - DAY 
Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre!" 
EXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY 
Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches. 
As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. Will notices this. 
Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly. 
Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS. The piano stops. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Go back to the start. Right hand only. 
The piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS. 
The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill. 
She and Will are startled to see each other. 
JENNY Oh. Oh. 
WILL Hello. 
JENNY I wasn't expecting you. 
Confused, Will checks the name on the form. 
WILL Are you Jenny Hill? 
JENNY I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward. (a beat) Like this. 
The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward... 
JENNY (to the student) Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the lesson today? We can go again next week. 
She hands him five dollars out of her pocket. 
STUDENT Do I have to give it back to my Mom? 
JENNY I won't tell her if you won't. 
You don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a flash. 
INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY 
While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will. 
WILL How did you know my father? 
JENNY This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him. 
A beat. Not flinching... 
WILL Were you and my father having an affair? 
JENNY (taken aback) Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour. 
WILL I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof. 
She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her into. Once she's finally free... 
JENNY Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie? 
WILL Because he's dying. 
A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. She's a tangle of conflicting emotions. 
JENNY Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game. 
WILL My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two. 
Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table. 
JENNY The first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here. And yet he did, twice. The first time, he was early. The second time, he was late. 
INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT 
It's late, and Edward is pensive.

Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby console. He checks the sharpness of the blade. 
SECURITY OFFICER Are you sure you don't want something a little more... sophisticated, sir? 
WORF Mind your post, Lieutenant. 
The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with the sword... decides he's ready. 
109   INT. BRIDGE                                                109 
Riker and Troi watching the schematic. 
Riker works a control and the display ZOOMS IN to display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting Engineering and the surrounding deck. A SWARM of DOTS representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering. 
RIKER (to com) Riker to Engineering. Mister Worf...the Borg are approaching your position. 
WORF'S COM VOICE Understood. We're ready. 
Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer... closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering. The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants. 
110   INT. ENGINEERING                                           110 
As before. The security guards have taken positions around the room, all weapons trained on the doors. 
Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in- hand. 
WORF (calls out) Charge weapons! 
A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone standing ready with their weapons charging. This is the moment of truth. 
Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready for battle. 
111   INT. BRIDGE                                                111 
Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now completely surrounded Engineering on all sides, including the deck directly above and below. In essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the rest of the ship. 
112   INT. ENGINEERING                                           112 
As before. Worf and the security team in their positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering through the walls and ceiling of an old house. 
Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of the room and travel to the other. There's an overpowering sense of creatures just outside those walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack Starfleet troops. 
113   INT. BRIDGE                                                113 
Riker and Troi watching the display. The Borg dots teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar. 
114   INT. ENGINEERING                                           114 
The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and get louder... 
... we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth, teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then... 
The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest sign of the Borg... but nothing happens. 
115   INT. BRIDGE                                                115 
Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots begin moving away from Engineering. It looks like the swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship. 
TROI They're bypassing Engineering... 
RIKER Where the hell are they going? 
OFF the mystery... 
CUT TO: 
116   INT. BORG HIVE                                             116 
CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker, Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own voice... bits and pieces of his life... 
The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more human." 
BORG QUEEN'S VOICE Data... 
Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg operating table... his right arm and shoulder are encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL, obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the room, carrying out various tasks. 
There's been a change since we've been here last. There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again. We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're definitely creepy. 
Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do, he's still immobilized. 
Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to- face with the Borg Queen again. 
BORG QUEEN You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?

Approaching Two-I-C, thinking he is dead. Two-I-C's eyes are open and he's trying to whisper something. Agu cannot hear it. He leans in closer. Two-I-C's breaths a death rattle. 
TWO-I-C You are just a boy. 
Agu looks at his hand, clammy and yellow, fingers gripping his blanket. 
TWO-I-C (CONT'D) Do you know you are just a boy? 
Two-I-C begins to tremble, panic. Agu reaches for his hand, holds it. 
TWO-I-C (CONT'D) Was this all for nothing? 
He looks at Two-I-C, unsure why he is feeling sad for this man at this moment. 
AGU (V.O.) It is like God is turning his gaze on Two-I-C. 
Two-I-C exhales, the trembling ceases. He is dead. Agu, drawn by the fading light, walks to the balcony overlooking the town. 
COMMANDANT Agu? Is that you. 
Agu can barely perceive Commandant sitting in the railing, his skin reflecting the faint embers of a joint cupped in his hands. Agu does not respond. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Agu. Come. Sit down with me. 
Agu leans into the railing. Commandant rubs the back of his neck. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) It is dangerous times now, Agu. Can't be trusting nobody. That is why it is always good to be sleeping with one eye open. And that is why I have you and Strika. 
Tripod enters with RADIO OPERATOR. 
TRIPOD Goodblood is asking for you. 
Commandant waves him away. Tripod, aware things have changed, waits an explanation. 
COMMANDANT Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am feeling sorry for you. 
Agu cannot tell if he heard him say it or if he dreamed he said it. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Sometimes I am. 
AGU Two-I-C is dead. 
EXT. UNFINISHED BUILDING - NIGHT 
Preacher SINGS over Two-I-C's body. They strip him of his "Two-I-C" jacket, his belt, boots, and anything else of use. He is left with only his dirty socks and underwear. 
AGU (V.O.) It is taking Two-I-C all day to be dying, and then he is dying when the moon is full and the night is shining like silver. 
COMMANDANT You are my new Two-I-C. 
Commandant places the jacket on Tripod, who proudly puts it on over his bare chest. 
AGU (V.O.) The the only way not to be fighting anymore is to be dying. 
COMMANDANT This was not God's work. This was man's. The Supreme Commander was our friend. Now he is our enemy. But we are not fearing change... for we are strong! 
MEN Strong and proud! 
COMMANDANT That is why we should be taking our own territory and filling our own pockets. Move out. 
The NDF Soldiers take stock in what they have, burn their vehicles and move out. 
EXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT 
Fog swirls along the canopy of the jungle. Commandant's tent has been reduced to a small lean to, separate from where everyone else sleeps under the trees. 
AGU (V.O.) Mother. If this war is ever ending I am thinking, I cannot be going back to doing child thing. 
Everyone sleeps. Suddenly they are attacked from unseen forces. Bullets pound the ground around them, burying men in dirt and tearing others up with shrapnel. 
AGU (V.O.) We are just wild animals now with no place to be going. 
Agu and Strika hold each other while bullet shells pour on them. The battle is over as quickly as it began. 
Commandant is frazzled. He picks up his hat, dusting it off, while yelling for the men to fall back. 
Preacher moves up and down the line, checking the men. 
PREACHER Tripod, Hope! 
Agu looks down the line. They are both bleeding. Hope is dead. Tripod still breathes, but his body is leaking blood from many wounds. He screams while staring wildly at everyone looking down at him, breathing.

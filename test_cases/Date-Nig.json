{"train": "DATE NIGHT \nWritten by \nJosh Klausner \nJune 11, 2008 \nFADE IN: \nINT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in. In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap. \nPHIL Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long, slow kiss. \nPHIL (CONT ' D ) Minty fresh. \nCLARA That was nice. \nPHIL It was nice. \nCLARA Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out? \nPHIL \n(CHUCKLES) Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's over! \nCLARA Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil. \nPHIL (reaches into picture pile) Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean that woman can't contain her 'Love! \nON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle deep in a manure bin. \nCLARA \n(LAUGHS) She just takes a while to warm up. You guys are gonna be best buddies. You picked a favorite of us yet? \nPhil finds the picture, handing it to Clara. \nCLARA (CONT'D) That's exactly the one I picked! \nClara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed. It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front of them. \nPHIL Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture. He notices. \nPHIL (CONT'D) \nWHAT IS \nCLARA I just... when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each other. Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us. No matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids- \nPHIL We're having kids? With an \"S\"? \n(CLARA LAUGHS) OK fine. But I promise you it's never gonna happen to us. \nCLARA Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when I'm long in the tooth. \nPHIL You'll be even hotter long toothed. Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy. \nCZ \n(GIGGLES Oh really? As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures. \nPHIL wasn't the pictures. \nCLARA You know how long that took? \n(MORE) \nPHIL (CONT'D) Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl \nA DAY- \nCLARA \n(CORRECTING HIM) A week. \nPHIL One bowl a day a week. Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie. \nPHIL (CONT'D) This is not for you today! \nCLARA \n(CHUCKLES) Yeah right. \nPHIL \n(SHRUGS) Worth a try. \nCLARA Did you get his lunch together? \nPHIL Oh. Whoops. \nCLARA \n(SIGHS) You just get his breakfast and I'll do it. As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly returning the carton to the fridge. \nCLARA (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but I'll be there as soon as I can. \nPHIL Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today. You know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that I don't \nUNDERSTAND- \nCLARA (focusing on Ollie's lunch) Ollie, do you want a banana? \nPHIL Did you hear me? \nCLARA (not looking at him) Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand. Banana Ollie? \nPHIL \n(BEAT) So I should probably get going. With the highway construction it takes forever to get downtown these days. \nCLARA OK. Have a good day. Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly kisses Phil on the cheek. \nCLL. -- (CONT ' D ) Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky. \nPHIL Sorry for the milky mouth. He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1 dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink, then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her head, she tosses the carton in the trash. \nEXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks a newspaper off his lawn. \nCHAZ (O.S.) Well, well! We're up bright and early, aren't we! \nPHIL Yes we are! (under his breath) ike you say to me every morning. Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara' car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING STUCK halfway. \nPHIL (CONT'D) \nOW! OW! OW! Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room. Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's seat. \nHONKING. \nEXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER \nThe Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR \nMR. RIVERS \n(CLEARS THROAT) OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want George to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too. \nPHIL Oh. \nMR. RIVERS s nothing personal. \n(BEAT) So let me get this straight. You're telling me that tomorrow I'm going to have to interview for the job I already have? Against George? \nMR. RIVERS I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need our pack leader to be more like... like a momma kangaroo. Ya get me? \nPHIL Kinda. \n(BEAT) Actually, no. Not really at all. \nMR. RIVERS The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle. But at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature. \nPHIL Sorry. Still not totally getting you. \nMR. RIVERS I've had a wife and a family. Three of them. It's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about. He can rip the meat. \nPHIL Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to... I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still... in the jungle! \nMR. RIVERS \n(BEAT) What does that mean? \nPHIL I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just can't. \nMR. RIVERS Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little... well... tame. \nPHIL \n(GETTING UP) That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers! I'll see you tomorrow. Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office. \nSCHOOL Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from school. \nCLARA So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our reservation's at 7:45. She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose. \nWithout breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini- bottle of Purell and cleans her hands. \nCLARA (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Mrs. Foster? Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot. \nCLARA Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you later. Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a warm smile. \nCLARA (CONT'D) I've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan. \nMRS. CARDIGAN I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries matter. \nCLARA 1\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd1 \nOK... \nMRS. CARDIGAN Can we speak a moment? Alone? \nCLARA Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car. As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Is everything OK? \nMRS. CARDIGAN Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately. Especially Jenny Diggs. \nCLARA Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's happening? \nMRS. CARDIGAN I'm going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out. But beyond that, ,i: overall attitude these days is just... sub par. E \n(MORE) \nCLARA You don't need to apologize, Phil. \nPHIL Listen, if I had more warning- \nE C Then something else would have come up. You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time. Even after Ollie was born. Now we never do anything together. They stare at each other, then Phil breaks \nPHIL Listen... any other night. \nCLARA OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then. As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her, feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in, conflicted. \nINT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER \nAs Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks him, still unsure. \nPHIL That dress really wasn't playing fair, Clara. With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Well get a move on, girl! She zips her dress back up. \nA DOORBELL RINGS. \nINT. RUTH'S FRONT DOOR \nRUTH, Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens. \nRUTH (to Clara and Ollie) Hey sweeties. \n(SUDDENLY COLD) Phil. \nPHIL Ruth. \nRUTH Nana rented us a special treat tonight before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz! \nPHIL, Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think that's a little scary for a 5 year old? \nRUTH (not looking at him) No, Phil, I don't. \nPHIL OK... not so sure about that. \nRUTH \nPHIL Clara? What do you think? \nRUTH (putting her pressure on) Yeah, Clara. What do you think? \nEXT. FRONT OF HOUSE \nPhil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door towards Phil's car. \nCLARA I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's doing us a favor tonight. \nPHIL fine. Fine. oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops. \nCLARA You know, I should pee before we go. \nPHIL \n(BEAT) OK. Sure. As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in the driver's seat. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I'll just wait in the car as you go back E inside to pee. Again. \nEXT. EISENHOWER PARKWAY - SUNSET \nAs the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the city. \nCAR - S Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents. \nPHIL You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected, but all everyone's going to remember when it's time to vote is all this mess. \nCLARA SHIVERS \nCLARA You're hot? \n(CHUCKLES) Stealing? You're kidding, right. \nPHIL We're not the Gales. \nCL ARA So? You said yourself - if you don't answer at the bar they give your table away. \nPHIL Well, what if they show up now? \nN CLAR 2 u get spanked' \nPHIL I'm serious! \nCLARA \n(SIGHS SADLY) I don't know. What if they do, Phil? Clara picks up her menu and reads, shaking her head. \nPHIL What? \nCLARA It's just... I don't know. You used to be the one who would think up stuff like this all the time. This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu for a beat. \nPHIL You know what? You're absolutely right. Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for what feels like the first time tonight. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale. \nE \nCLARA \n(SMILES) It's OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you look very handsome tonight? \nPHIL You're not looking too shabby yours Mrs. Gale. \nGRUFF VOICE (O.S.) Mr. Gale? They turn, surprised, to see TWO BURLY MEN in suits at their table. The Older of the two politely speaks to them. \nOLDER BURLY MAN We need to have a word with you both. \nCLARA What's this about? \nOLDER BURLY MAN k you know what this is about. you could please come with us. \nPHIL N Why can't we talk here? u \nOLDER BURLY 'MAN (beat, smiles) I think it would save everyone a lot of embarrassment. (gestures with hand) Please... The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull it out. Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an \"I told you so\" look as he follows the older Burly Man through the restaurant toward the kitchen doors, the Younger Burly Man walking behind them with Clara. \nINT. BACK KITCHEN AREA - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Burly Man leads them through the kitchen. A WAITER stops, surprised. \nWAITER Can I help you? OLDER s _ \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd'LY MAN Nah. We're fine \u00c2\u00ae Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man pushes the down button. The elevator opens. \nPHIL Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we going? \nOLDER BURLY MAN Get in, please. The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them into the elevator. \nCLARA Hey! Jesus! The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach in their pockets. \nPHIL Listen, this is all getting out of hand, OK? I admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong, but- Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT. \nE CLOSEUP ON PHIL'S NOSE An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's TIED TO A CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the table. \nPHIL Whoa. What the hell is this? Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older Burly Man waves the stick under her nose. \nCLARA \n(FREAKED) Phil?!? What's going on? \nPHIL I don't know. A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table \nSPEAKERPHONE The chloroform may make you feel dizzy for a few moments, but it will go away. \nU Phil takes in what's going on, freaked. \nPHIL Please! You can't do this! We're not lying! \nSPEAKERPHONE One... two... three... four... Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee. \nPHIL Oh Jesus. Don't do it! \nSPEAKERPHONE Five... six... seven... eight... \nPHIL Jesus! \nCLARA \nOK FINE! FINE! YOU WIN! YOU CAN HAVE \nTHE GODDAMN PHOTOS! \nEveryone looks over. Phil's surprised. \nCLARA (CONT'D) But we can't just tell you where they are. We have to take you to them. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - A LITTLE LATER \nIn the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the keys back to Harry. \nFRANK You drive with her in front. \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) So what's your plan here? \nCLARA \n(WHISPERS) I don't have a plan Phil. \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) You don't have a plan? \nCLARA E \n(WHISPERS) No. I was just trying to keep our knees for the time being. \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) Well, if we end up in that car with them we're as good as dead. \nFRANK Quiet! \nCLARA \n(WHISPERS) Well, any time you want to help... \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) What's that supposed to mean? \nFRANK I said quiet! They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead. \nCLARA Phil? He drops to the ground. \nPHIL Whoa. \nCLARA Phil? What is it? \nPHIL I'm... not feeling so great... \nHARRY 's wrong with him? \nCL: I don't know. \nPHIL \nPHIL I thought you said you weren't going to interrupt me, Clara. \nC I just want him to understand we weren't really \"stealing\" someone else's \nRESERVATI Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth. \nPHIL Do you think he really cares, Clara? were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and almost shot! I don't think he's going turn around and book us for reservation theft! Am I right? \nYOUNG POLIO OFFICER Please. Go on. \nPHIL So all of a sudden Clara yells out that we're these other people. \nYOUNG POLICEMAN \n(SURPRISED) You just took someone else's reservation? \nPHIL Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the speakerphone couldn't believe it! \nCLARA You two kinda bonded over that, didn't you? \nPHIL We didn't \"bond\" over it. I'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do. \nYC JG POLICEMAN Guys, you lost We were in the restaurant. \nCLARA \n(IGNORING HIM) Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's weird to do so it's weird to do? \nYOUNG POLICEMAN Guys? You're new \"buddy.\" \nPHIL Oh c'mon! And we found out speakerphone guy's name, Phil. It's Mr. Stockton. The Young Policeman looks up, interested. \nOF FTCER Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute. The Officer dials an extension on the phone. \nOFFICER C'-D) Lieutecant Manning? \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdeeird story. Havea couple '.n here who claim --o have escaped a kid- 7-ng this evening and the name Stockt came up. OK. Will do. He hangs up. \nOFFICER (CONT'D) Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified ere's anything involving Mr. n. \nE \nPHIL Wait. So you already know about this guy? You know who he is? A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's, LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He reaches over and shakes their hands. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING How do you do. Lieutenant Manning. The Officer offers him his note pad. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING \n(CONT'D) Nah, as long as they're here might as well get everything from the horse's mouth, right? As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning sidles down into his seat. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING \n(CONT'D) Can I get you guys anything to drink? Coffee? Water? Maybe a shot or two of r whiskey? \nPHIL That sounds more like \nLIEUTENANT MANNING So why don't you tell me all about your incident with Mr. Stockton. \nPHIL You tell it, Clara. \nCLARA Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Guys... you've obviously been through something traumatic tonight. Thankfully it's over and you're both safe and sound. Maybe you should cut each other a little bit more of a break. Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air. Manning's right. \nPHIL Seriously, Clara. You tell him. \nCJ __ Well, we never a. t_::ally \"met\" Stockton. \n(MORE) \nCLARA (CONT`B) He was in another room on a speakerphone where these guys who kidnapped us took us. But he was obviously the one pulling the strings. \nPHIL Who is this Stockton guy anyway? \nPHIL Oh God. \nCLARA How do we get out of here? \nINT. ING'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nManning talks in his off ice. \nE \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be contained. Right now. Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through the police station to the interview room. He stops in the doorway... .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside at the desk. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING \n(CONT'D) Where'd they go? \nOFFICER They said you were done with them. Manning walks quickly back to his office. Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS BULLETIN. We are CLOSE UP on the computer screen as the words come \nUP \nALL LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT... PHIL AND CLARA \nFOSTER... FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE... ARMED AND DANGEROUS. \nINT. TOWNCAR - LATE \nClara drives as Phil scans the rearview mirror from the passenger seat. \nCLARA We can't just go to another police station, Phil! We don't know how big this is! It might not just be Manning! \nPHIL Well then we're screwed! Who do we go to? The FBI? The CIA? \nCLARA \n(SHAKES HEAD) They're not going to believe us over a Police Lieutenant! \n(REALIZING) Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta lose it too. Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE. She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into the space. \nR\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd \nU \nPHIL You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now! \nCLARA just let me do it, She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Dammit! I hate this! \nPHIL It's all right. You just should have spun it when I told you to. Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again. \nPHIL (CONT'D) rn! Quick! \nCLARA Would you stop it? You're stressing me out! Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH \nFLASHING LIGH` \nHearing the alarm, a LARGE MAN rushes out of a restaurant nearby, looking at them. \nLARGE MAN Hey! You just hit my The Large Man stomps toward them. \nPHIL Run! Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe yells after them. \nL Assholes! \nEY INS LAT They catch their breath in the alley. OK. So we've got no car. They know where we live. So where can we- \n(REALIZES SOMETHING) shit. \nClara's eyes go wide as it hits her as well. \nCLARA Ollie. Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening as Ruth PICKS UP. \nPHIL 0 yeah? Who else are you \"in touch\" h on Facebook? \nCLARA \nO PHONE) Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you're there. It's Clara Foster... \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHOLBROOKE PETERSON, a thoroughbred of a man in his mid- 30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a smile to find Phil and Clara. \nHOLBROOKE Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same \nCLARA So do you! He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little. \nHOLBROOKE You feel exactly the same too. Phil double-takes. Did he hear him right? \nR1 U \nCLARA This is my husband, Phil. \nHOLBROOKE Ah! The man who actually landed Clara. Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile and holds out his hand. \nHOLBROOKE (CONT'D) Philly Cheese Steak. Nice to meet you. \nPHIL Um... yeah... I don't go by... it's 1 - usL Phil. Nice to meet you, too. \nHOLBROOKE Well, c'mon in. If you don't mind, take off your shoes. \nCLA. A Oh.Sure. \nHOLBROOKE Cutsdown on the cleaning. Which cuts downon the use of all those chemicals andplastics, blab blah blah. Reduces my \nCF. \nPHIL \nCF? \nHOLBROOKE Carbon footprint. \nPHIL Oh. The environmental thing. \nHOLBROOKE \n(CHUCKLES) Yeah, the \"environmental thing,\" Phil. As they walk into the apartment in their socks, they notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES. \nCLARA How beautiful. Or, the candles... Did we \nERRUPT SOMETHING- Oh, no. I jus-_. --'-D.> myself off the gr a few weeks ago. \nPHI The grid? \nHOLBROOKE Power grid. I actually have a negative carbon footprint now. Making up for, you know, all you \"Phil\"-i-stines in the suburbs. Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke gestures to some cardboard furniture. \nHOLBROOKE (CONT'D) So have a seat. Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and putting it on the table. \nPHIL Whoa. You carry that around at home? \nHOLBROOKE Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her under my pillow. \n(SHRUGS) Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it as... I carry the weight so citizens like yourselves don't have to. \nCLARA It's so funny. I always knew you'd end up doing something in public service. \nHOLBROOKE \n(SHRUGS HUMBLY) I don't know. That's lust how I Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but Clara's focused on Holbrooke. \nHOLBROOKE (V.0.) (CONT'D) Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of. \nINT. HOLBROOKE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nCLARA Thank you so much, Holbrooke. (sighs, relieved) I feel like we're in good hands for the E first time tonight. As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood. \nCLARE What's wrong? \nPHIL I don't know. Maybe I should have had one of Holbrooke's eeegerag warn raaaarrrrghereeeeetas. \n!NT. CAR - LATER Clam::- olbrooke in the front seat and Phil crt-- - in t=-\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd back, they pull up and park at the FBI bui Aing m \nPHIL smells like french fries back here, \nHOLBROOK' Car runs on cooking oil. I just go around to restaurants and recycle their old fry oil. \nC \nCLARA Phil's really had enough with this guy. Your goodness... where does it end? Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke doesn't get his sarcasm. \nHOLBROOKE \n(SHRUGS) How I roll. Now for some reason they wanted us to come in the back entrance. He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his shoulder strap before getting out of the car. \nINT. FBI WINDOW \nThrough the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara walking toward the back of the building. In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then whispers into his walkie. \nSHADOWY GUY Positions. \nFBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and Clara FREEZE behind them. At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in charge, yells to them. \nAGENT Continue slowly down the hallway. sudden movements. Are they armed, Peterson? \nHOLBROOKE Uh, \nPHIL What the hell's going o \nHOLBROOKE I don't know. \nE \nPHIL Well, tell them to stand down. \nHOLBROOKE Uh.. . \nPHIL Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke. \nAGENT #1 His men? The Agents look at each other and chuckle. \nAGENT #2 What do you want us to do, Holbrooke? Reformat our hard drives? \nAGENT #3 Our badass I.T. guy! The laughter builds. \nCLARA I. I. guy? \nHOLBROOKE OK... I'm not the \"I.T. guy.\" I help out \nE with computer questions out of kindness! But see if that happens anymore, Harold! \nAGENT #1 Alright, enough. Point is, Agent Peterson scored tonight. When I typed in those socials, an APB shot up with a whole laundry list on these guys. \nPHIL What? \nCLARA crooked cop did it! It's a lie! \nAGENT #1 It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just here to back you up. Holbrooke... Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm. \nHOLBROOKE Listen guys. I'll just book you and then tomorrow we can straighten the whole- \nE \nCLARA (pulling arm away) What? Oh no you're not! Oooohs from the Agents. \nAGENT #3 You just gonna take that, Peterson? \nCLARA Yeah, a bobble's bad... \nHOLBROOKE Listen, if you just leave me here I can tell them you ran the other way. It'll buy you time to get there. And maybe I can work on clearing all this up for you. Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking. \nCLARA What? \nPHIL Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and hands it to Holbrooke \nPHIL (CONT'D) Here. Tell them you got it back from us. Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful. \nHOLBROOKE Thanks, Phil. As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of husband. \nEXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED. \nPHIL it's just on the other side of that bridge. I think we're going to make it. He notices Clara looking at him. \nPHIL (COND What? \nCLARA Nothing. That was just nice of you, back there. \n(BEAT) This is crazy, but you know what I'm, reminded of right now? \nPHIL Bourne identity? \nCLARA I'm talking about right now. When we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab those \"healthy\" dogs and cheese fries at the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch the sunrise. \nPHIL Where I held your hand for the first time. \nCLARA I can't believe we used to stay up all night like that. \nPHIL It's because we could sleep 'til noon. \nCLARA \n(SMILES SLYLY) If I remember correctly, we weren't always \"sleeping.\" Beat as they share the moment together, walking. \nPHIL I just don't understand when we got so... I don't know... \nCLARA Old. \nPHIL No, I was thinking numb. When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad? \nCLARA We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we haven't been that honest with each other recently. Phil doesn't understa \nCLARA (CONT'D) Not big things. Just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us. \n(BEAT) Like the fact I know you never want to talk about us having this other baby. \nPHIL It's not that I don't want another kid, Clara. It's just... I used to be the whole pie with you. And now with Ollie and your work, I'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan I have left of your attention going into some new baby's mouth! \nCLARA But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! It's all about your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive past them over the bridge. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Shit! \nPHIL I think we're OK. Just play cool and keep walking. The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1 Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief. Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming back toward them. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Now you can say shit. Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath them. \nPHIL (CONT'D) e 's only a few feet. \nCLARA What u high? No way. But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them, Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge. \nCLARA (CONT'D) \nAH! \nAs she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they DANGLE above the water and the boat. \nCLARA (CONT'D Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?! \nPHIL Let go, Clara! \nPHIL Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone, dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head. \nCLARA What? \nPHIL You're not listening to me again! \nCLARA \"You have to know where they are and h to get in-\" \nPHIL That's great. Clara wanna cracker? \nC LARA I'm calling because of what you said, Phil. I know who can help us. Clara dials the number. \nCLARA_ (CONT'D) Hey Jane, it's Clara. \n(LISTENS) Where am I? (beat, looks around) I'm... I'm on a party cruise around Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into quite a night. Listen, we need to go to this club called the Rainbow later. Do you know how we can get in? Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side. A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara. \nPHIL ara... Clara turns and looks. \nCLARA Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've actually gotta jump off right now. \nINT. TOUR BOAT - LATER \nPOLICE swarm all over the tour boat, checking every compartment. A DRUNKEN PARTIER shows Lieutenant Manning SNAPSHOTS of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and arguing on the back of his digital camera. A POLICEMAN comes up to Manning and shakes his head. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Check again. Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away. \nPARTIER Hey! That's mine, man! \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Evidence. The Partier mumbles \"Asshole\" as he stumbles Manning si i.s and looks out over the wa \nE \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nIt's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone. \nCLARA Mine's totally shot too. \nPHIL You got the info from her though, right? \nCLARA Yeah, but we can't get in looking like this, Phil. \nPHIL I don't think we have a choice. Not a big shopping hour. They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights blazing. Windows show machines filled with young HARDBODIES working out. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the other hand. Who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning? Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks back up at the building. \nPHIL (CONT'D) You wanna do a little cardio? Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He shakes his head. \nPHIL (CONT'D) OK, now that's scary. You know you're starting to think like a real criminal? You know that, don't you? Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's \"Secret Agent Man\" over a TrC _ GE . \nINT. 24 HOUR FITNESS CENTER - MONTAGE \n- Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the GYM GREETER boredly watches TV. They say something and the Greeter waves them through without looking up. As they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND \nCLOD?!? \n- In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one, he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth, pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE. - In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel, blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD DASH for the lockers. - Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him, excitedly telling him something and pointing outside. The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly undressing. - The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A\"S DRIPPING \nCLOTHES. - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels the same about Phil. \nEXT. ALLEY - LATER \nLooking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a dark, derelict alley. \nPHIL Down here? \nJANE It's what she said. \nPHIL And if you die, does Jane get your commissic-l on the open house? Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby. Nervously, Clara approaches. \nCLARA Excuse me? Men shoot her a fierce look. \nPHIL Uh... well, same thing as you guys, I would guess. Working those \"extra hours,\" right? \nCLARA (O.S.) Phil! Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her in, obviously impressed. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Phil, we gotta go. I found out where- \nPHIL \nERRUPTING) Clara, you remember Mr. Rivers? Clara suddenly notices Phil's boss. Oh. Oh. Yeah. \nGEORGE And I'm George. \nCLARK Sorry, but I've got to steal him. We've gotta be somewhere else right now. \nMR. RIVERS At 2 in the morning? Where are you guys headed? \nPHIL \n(BEAT) I'm sorry, Mr. Rivers. We really can talk about it. Phil and Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr. Rivers watches the hand_\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd__e, dressed up couple, intrigued. \nMR. RIVERS Phil Foster with places to go he can talk about at 2 in the morning. \n(THOUGHTFUL ) \n(MORE) \nMR. RIVERS (CONT'D) You know what makes kangaroos so damn dangerous, George? They look so sweet and tame, so you forget they're wild animals. Lethal when they want to be. George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out his hand for another handshake, but Mr. Rivers, still watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING. \nCLOSEUP ON A TV MONITOR A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil and Clara making their way through the crowd to the exit. In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with two metal balls in his hand. \nMR. STOCKTON See where they take you. \nEXT. RUN DOWN ROW HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER \nPhil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted looking row house. No answer. Clara tries the door... \nPHIL That never really- OPENS. She shoots Phil a look. \nPHIL (CONT'D) OK. Never mind. Phil and Clara inch insi \nRUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS As they start down the dark hallway to the living room, Phil hunches over, hugging the wall. \nCLARA are you bent over like that? \nPI sneaking. \nCLA?.A Rut why don't you just walk normally and quietly? \nPHI This is the wav I sneak. You sneak in your way and I'll sneak in mine, OK? \nCL \n(SHRUGS) OK. Fine. I was just asking. Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch. Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him. \nRAY Talk! Who are you? \nPHIL You know, that's like the 5th gun I've had to my head tonight! Just lower that thing and cool it, OK? Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does. \nDORA She was in the bathroom at the restaurant! \nRAY Who are you? \nPHIL Who are we? Good question! Well, everybody thinks we're \"the Gales\" because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight! \nRAY \n(CONFUSED) What? Why would you take our reservation? Phil shoots Clara a look. \nCLARE Don't. \nRAY Both of you. Stand ov there in the corner. Dammit Dora, ere's your goddamn brother? He was E,.--,-Dc.-zed to b here an hour ago! I don't know, Ra_, He's not answering his phone. \nFRANK(CONT'D) You stay put. He hurries back through the house. \nFRONT OF RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Phil and Clara sprint to the street as a BUICK pulls up in front and a confused looking CHUBBY GUY steps \nCHUBBY GUY Hey? Which is 357 Maple Street? \nPHIL You're Dora's brother? \nCHUBBY GUY Who are you? \nPHIL You're late! \nCHUBBY GUY OK sorry! The roads are all screwed with all this construction- BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview mirror of the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and marching toward them, Harry right behind him. \nCHUBBY GUY (CONT'D) Hey! Phil quickly pushes Dora's brother aside as he and Clara hop into the Buick and PEEL OUT. \nFrank and Harry SPRINT for their Towncar down the block. \nINT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nPhil screeches the car around the corner. \nCLARA Phil! Careful! Phil WHIPS the car around another bend. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Please, Phil! It's not going to do any good if you- \nPHIL (taking another sharp turn) Clara! Please! Just leave the driving to me, OK?!? I know what I'm- SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the windshield. Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're face to face - nose to nose - with another broken windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 stares at them in shock. \nBLACK DUDE No no no. Tell me you did not just do that. \nPHIL Shit! The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in hands. \nBLACK DUDE Oh, man! You did not just do that! Whew, you gonna be payin' for this! \nPHIL owe you one. Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place. Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that \nTHE SMASHED FRONT GRILL OF THEIR CAR HAS INTERLOCKED WITH \nASHED FRONT GRILL OF THE BLACK DUDE'S HONDA. _-M The Black Dude comes toward him. \nBLACK DUDE Oh no no no. You're gonna get outta this car and hand me over a license and some insurance. We gonna do this right. Man, I think I got whiplash and shit. A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S TOTnNCAR coming around the corner. \nPHIL Shit. Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into the Black Dude's souped up Honda. \nBLACK DUDE Hey! HEY! What do you think you're doing? The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara. \nPHIL \nPUT IT IN REVERSE AND GUN IT, CLARA! \nCLARA What? That's insane! \nE Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash into them in seconds... \nPHIL \nI KNOW IT IS! BUT DO IT! Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on the gas. The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield into the passenger's seat next to Phil. \nBLACK DUDE \nJESUS CHRIST! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH \nYOU?!! \nPHIL \nNOW PUT IT IN DRIVE! \nCLARA Huh? \nBLACK DUDE \nPHIL! LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a \nDELIVERY TRUCK. \nPHIL, CLARA AND BLACK DUDE \nAHHHH! Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS, jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK. In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths drop. \nEXT. MCCORMICK ICE RINK \nThe conjoined cars sail across the grass and SMASH THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK. Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil, Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world is a SPINNING BLUR around them. Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings, Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them. He searches where to go next, then spots something. \nPHIL Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor. Give it everything! Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors it. The car goes faster... faster... \nBLACK Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that. \nCLARA Doing what? What are you doing?!? Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY. \nCL. (CONT'D) Oh God. \nPHIL Just trust me! The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE \nSTAIRWAY! The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath, Frank reverses back down the steps. \nEXT. CLOUD GATE \nPhil and the Black Guy both look back over their shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds up his hand for Phil. \nBLACK DUDE Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man. Wicked. They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil, the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up. \nPHIL \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Sorry. \nBLACK DUDE s cool. \nCLARA \n(SPOTTING SOMETHING) They're back. They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS. \nBLACK DUDE Jesus! What the hell are you guys in trouble for? \n'D R \n(SIGHS) f i ght... you name it. \nEXT. GREAT LAWN \nPhil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase. \nEXT. COLUMBUS DRIVE \nPhil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at Clara. \nPHIL Can we just try to work together at this? \nCLARA \nPHIL- \nPHIL I'm not blaming you. Please? Clara nods. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Now whatever direction I give you, take your normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent, OK? \nCLARA 35 percent. Fine. \nPHIL OK. Small left. Now! \nE Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts They ZOOM around the corner. \nPHIL (CONT'D) \n(LOOKING BACK) Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara! Now give me a medium right. Do it! She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another street. \nCLARA Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't you! \nPHIL Oh, you have no idea! Every single day from the moment we wake up you're bossy, \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 disapproving, inconsiderate- \nCLARA I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!? Have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after Tsunami Phil's blown through? The floor! The sink! You use my toothbrush. \nPHIL What's the difference? Afraid you're gonna get my cooties? \nCLARA I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me! And how many years have I asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right? \nPHIL Listen to yourself! You have problems with how I pqt in the toilet paper! \nC Because under makes no sense, Phil! Under makes no sense! When it's under it doesn't pull off right! It just keeps spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade properly! \n(MORE) \nCLARA (CONTVD) After ten years of asking you to have roll the right way, you still can't do it! \nPHIL Yeah, how about the fact that I have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears! You steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself. \nCLARA What? Phil, I do not \"steal\" the comforter. It just happens when we're- \nPHIL (points at her) Bulls Bull-shit. \nCLARA Don't you point that at me! \nPHIL I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't think I don't! \n(ILLUSTRATING) You wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so I can't pull it at all. \nCLARA I do not leg lock the comforter! \nPHIL Oh yes you do! \nCLARA u think I don't know your little icks? Where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you don't have to be the one to \"finish\" it and replace it? \nPHIL You're right. I do that. You know why do that, Clara? \nCLARA Because you don't want to haul your ass to the market to buy it yourself! \nPHIL Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath! You're like the Nutrition Nazi. \n(MORE) \nPHIL (CONT' D ) And I've got to be your little Nutrition Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this \"united front\" with Ollie! What's wrong if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar instead of one? Or if his handwriting isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school for one day not dressed like Finneas J. Nerdo! \nCLARA Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while I get to be the one who makes sure our child's fed, clothed and \nSURVIVES! \nPHIL How would you even know? You don't give me or anyone else a chance! You're so goddamn controlling! You've got to be Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers! You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady! \nCLARA Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay attention to you, Phil? Because you give me a headache! Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a frustrated sigh. \nPHIL What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse? How could it be? Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks and the contents spill all over the road. \nCLARA Screw you, Phil! \nPHIL Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I survive tonight I'm screwed all around anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with my job! \nCLARA What are you talking about, screwed with your job? \nPHIL was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so George wouldn't take it over tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen! \nCLARA Why didn't you tell me? \nPHIL I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I didn't want you chiming in on how Mr. Rivers was right. He wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me! Someone who doesn't \"play it safe.\" Someone who'll \"take a risk.\" \nCLARA I can't believe that's what you think do. \nPHI Yeah, well... \nINT. MAYOR'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe Mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs. She goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone again. \nMAYOR DIGGS \nTHAT'S \nPHIL (PHONE) That's it. Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead. \nMAYOR DIGGS E If you really can get me... what I was supposed to receive earlier without this getting out, I promise you I'll take care of your safety. \nPHIL (PHONE) But now the police think that- \nMAYOR DIGGS Trust me. Get me the photos and he won't be bothering you again. \nINT. CARDIGAN'S OFFICE \nClara sees Phil furrow his brow, confused. \nCLARA is it? Phil's concentrating hard on something. Thinking. \nMAYOR DIGGS (PHONE) \nPHIL Uh... yeah. We'll meet you at the Adler Planetarium in 1 hour. Come alone. E \nINT. MAYOR'S BEDROOM \nThe Mayor rubs his forehead. \nMAYOR DIGGS Of course. And... thank you. Click. The Mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves the bedroom. \nINT. MAYOR D'S HOME OFFICE \nDowning a glass of scotch, the Mayor sits at his desk and lets out a sigh of relief. Beat. He picks up his desk phone and dials. \nMAYOR DIGGS (PHOII ) We dodged a bullet. They calac _e . \nINT. STOCKTON'S BACK ROOM - S \nMr. Stockton sits at his desk, staring at a blueish monitor screen. \nSTOCKTON interesting. ON STOCKTON'S MONITOR in front of him we see that Frank and Harry hold a wounded Ray and Dora in the meat locker. \nMAYOR DIGGS (PHONE) They thought you were stealing the photos from the Gales to try to blackmail me yourself. \nMR. STOCKTON Did they, now? That's great. \nMAYOR DIGGS (PHONE) They're going to meet me in an hour with them. Alone. \nMR. STOCKTON st keeps getting better. \nADLER PLANETARIUM - LATER Phil and Clara sit silently on the steps of the beautiful, old Alder Planetarium looking at dawn hitting the CHICAGO SKYLINE. \nCLARA Man, I love this city. Always have. \nPHIL When was the last time we watched the sunrise together? \nCLARA Probably the last time we were here. \nPHIL \n(THINKS) Nope. it wasn't. It was the morning that Ollie was born. \nCT,ARA \nES) You're The morning Ollie was born. They look at each other, remembering. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Man, I'm starving! \nPHIL Me too. \n", "test1_input": "CLARA Phil, please don't. You think they're shortcuts but they always take longer. And we're already- \nPHIL Clara, please just trust me, OK They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated, Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just leaves it blowing on him as they drive. \nINT. THE SIGNATURE ROOM \nPhil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan. \nPHIL I promise you it wouldn't have been any faster. I promise! OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're here? I'm gonna go pee. \nPHIL Now? \nCLARA What? \nPHIL Nothing. As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS. \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS Good evening. Welcome to the Signature Room. \nPHIL Thanks. The name is Foster. \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS Foster... Oh, I'm sorry. We just had give away your table. \nPHIL You gave away our table? We're just ten minutes late! \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS \nE \nAD SERIOUS) Actually, you're 11 minutes late. \nPHIL \n(STUNNED) OK. But don't you guys have, like, some kind of grace period or something? \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS have an eight minute grace period. \nPHIL You have an eight minute grace period? How did you come up with an eight minute grace period? \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS \n(SHRUGS) I just work here, \nPHIL So what if someone's 9 minutes late? \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS We're allowed to give a two minute grace on the grace. \nPHIL OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're 11 minutes late. That's just one minute later than the grace on the grace. \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS I'm sorry sir, but management specifically said no grace on the grace on the grace. After ten minutes, we send a host around calling your name and if there's no answer, we give the table away. Sorry. \nPHIL So how long's the wait for another table? \nSUPERMODEL HOSTESS Well, let's see... Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN NAMES. As she turns to the next page... \nPHIL Oh boy. \nINT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEven the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over. A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in the Women's room. \nSLICK LOOKING MAN We've gotta leave now. \n(SPOTTING CLARA) Whoops. Sorry. \nCLARA It's OK. The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her hands. \nINT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER \nClara finds Phil at the bar, downing handfuls of peanuts. \nCLARA How lc= -until they seat us? \n", "test1_true": "CLARA What?!? Did you tell them that we hit traffic? \nPHIL They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call your name at the bar and you don't answer, they give your table away. So how about a nut? A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar. \nYOUNG HOST \nGALE PARTY? Clara sighs, frustrated. \nCLARA I mean, did you try something like telling her it was our anniversary, or my birthday, or slipping her some money- \nPHIL Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the answer! Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST searching for the party and starts focusing on him instead of Phil as she thinks. \nYOUNG HOST \nGALE PARTY? \nPHIL I'm sure if you had been there instead of peeing again you would have done it better. \nYOUNG HOST \nGALE PARTY? \nCLARA \n(WATCHING HOST) \nPHIL You're not even listening to me, are you? \nCLARA (repeats, still watching) Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been there instead of peeing again I would have done it better. \nClara, Just because you can repeat the words I say doesn't mean you're- \nYOUNG HOST \nLAST CALL! GALE- \nCLARA Sorry! We're right here! \nPHIL Wait. What are you doing? \nCLARA Shhh! The Young Host approaches. \nYOUNG HOST Gale party of three? \nCLARA The third's running a little going to start without them. \nYOUNG HOST eat. Follow me. Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it. He falls into line after her as she follows the Young Host to th restaurant. \nINT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SIGNATURE ROOM - MOMENTS LA \nhields his face as they pass the Supermodel Hos at the Greeting Station. The Young Host leads them secluded table right by the windows - THE BEST TABLE \nTHE RESTAURANT. \nYOUNG HOST (handing them menus) Enjoy your dinner. The Young, Host leaves. \nCLARA See? Was that so hard to do, Phil? bad to be the Gales, eh? Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the restaurant. \nCLARA (CONT'B) Look Phil! It's white truffle season! I'm totally doing it! \nE \nPHIL We can't do this, Clara. \nCLARA I'm taking you out. \nPHIL Not the truffles. \n(DEAD SERIOUS) This is stealing. \nCLARA \n", "test2_input": "DOORMAN You too. \nELEVATOR As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE and MOUTH HOLES over their heads. \nINT. MRS. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nMrs. Cardigan, in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask pulled up on her forehead, walks through her dark living room toward the POUNDING on her front door. \nPHIL (O.S.) \n(THROUGH DOOR) \nGAS AK LADY! OPEN UP! \nMRS. CARDIGAN All right. All- As Mrs. Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their masks, BUM RUSH her. Screaming, Cardigan dodges, running back to her desk. Phil and Clara give chase, but Cardigan grabs a LARGE METAL YARDSTICK and starts WHOPPING PHIL over and over on his paper bag head, screaming the whole time. \nMRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D) \nAHHHHH! \nPHIL \nOW! OW! OW! Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down. \nrubs his paper bag head. \n9i. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Jesus! \nINT. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nHaving put Cardigan's eyenask back over her eyes, Clara, bag off, holds Cardigan in a chair as Phil comes back into the living room holding two spools of FUZZY YARN. \nPHIL I can't find any rope. Only yarn. \nCLARA Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start looking. Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara searches Cardigan's desk. \nMRS. CARDIGAN You two weren't very prepared. \nPHIL Excuse me? \nMRS. CARDIGAN \nE You should have been more prepared. Thought ahead and brought the rope you. \nPHIL OK, why don't you lay off the critiqu \nMRS. CARD---'--' 's not a critique. It's a fact. \nPHIL Oh is it a fact? \nMRS. CARDIGA? Yes. ng word choice. \nPHIL Wrong word choice? Unbelievable! Well, let me throw a little word choice \"correction\" your way. \nCLARA Partner! \nPHIL Five year old kids can't be \"antagonistic.\" \nE \nCLARA \nPARTNE Phil looks over. Clara makes the \"Cut it out\" gesture across her throat. \nCLARA (CONT'D) If you're done tying her up, come over and help. Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks on the desk. \nMRS. CARDIGAN The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if you haven't figured it out yet! What idiots! \nPHIL You must be such a positive influence on our youth. \n", "test2_true": "CLARA Partner! \n(TO CARDIGAN) 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1 Listen, lady, just sit tight and we'll be out of here before you know it. Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when he spots something and doubles back, starting to read. His brow furrows. Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Got it! She notices Phil's expression. \nCLARA (CONT ' D ) What? hands the book to Clara to read. She does and darkens. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Oliver told her he's being mean to Je y Briggs because... he says he wants to marry her? \nPHIL \n(NODS) And that's what married people do. \nAs this hits them, Phil and Clara look at each other, then at Mrs. Cardigan, blindfolded in the living room. \nMRS. CARDIGAN \n(SARCASTIC) What's wrong over there? No \"crown jewels\" yet? \nCLARA Let's make the call, \nINT. MAYOR REYNOLD'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe PHONE RINGS in Mayor Reynold's bedroom.

CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - SAME \nOn the phone in Cardigan's office, Phil is confused. \nPHIL Lucy? Who's Lucy? \nMRS. CARDIGAN I'm Lucy. \nCLARA (stunned', You and the Mayor are on a first name basis? \nMRS. CARDIGAN You're calling our Mayor in the middle of the night? \n(YELLS) I had nothing to do with this Charlie! \nCLARA Charlie?!?

What happened to that, bitch? \nPHIL Hey \"partner.\" How about you put a sock in it now. \nMAYOR DIGGS \n(PHONE) Who is this ? r1 \nPHIL You don't know me, Mr. Mayor, but I've recently come into possession of something that you were supposed to get from the Gales tonight. Silence on the line. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Hello? \nMAYOR DIGGS (PHONE) \n(CLEARS THROAT) And? \nPHIL And whether you realize it or not, we ended up doing you a favor. You see, this man named Mr. Stockton - I know if you know him- \nMAYOR DIGGS (PH( I know who he is. \nPHIL Well, he tried to steal the photos from the Gales. He's even got cops on his payroll helping him out. We think he was planning to sabotage your re-election. \nMAYOR DIGGS (PHONE) So what do you want for them? \nPHIL What do we want?

Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing it to him. \nPHIL This is what you're looking for. I've tten down our information inside. \nMAYOR DIGGS And that's it? \nPHIL That's it. We're going home now. The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind, nervously tapping the envelope in his hand. As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr. Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Oh God. Run, Clara! Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT rings out. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING The next one won't be a warning shot. They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with the plastic. \nMR. STOCKTON (to Harry and Frank Let's do it over there. y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on the grass nearby. \nMAYOR DIGGS I'm going to wait in the c r don't mind. \nMR. STOCKTON Sure thing, Mr. Mayor. \nE As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and Clara to walk to the plastic sheets. \nPHIL Please. Please don't do \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Over there. \nPHIL Please! We have a child! \n'VT MINING said over there! \n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdJ PH I L \n(BEGGING) Just me then, OK? I promise you she's not going to say anything! Please! We have a child! \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Last time I'm going to say it. Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING \n(CONT'D) On your knees. Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes looking back at him and they kneel in front of the plastic, side by side. Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his gun. \nM A Y O R DIG GS (O . S . ) \nWHAT THE Mr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn. Mayor Diggs sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ''w Wila Envelope. \nPHIL -eally were planning to give you the pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you -.sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us. That made me a little suspicious because I never told you which cop it was. \nCLARA Then we got to talking and realized how dumb we were. \n(MORE) \nCLARA (CONT'D) E If you came on to some waitress at the Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn comfortable there. \nPHIL Which meant Stockton was probably your buddy. \nMR. STOCKTON Where are the pictures? \nPHIL But we were still confused, because if you guys are buddies, how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation? Mr. Stockton's face blanches. \nMR. STOCKTON They're obviously not going to tell us! Just shoot them! \nMAYOR DIGGS Wait. I've heard that name. What's the Falconwood Corporation? \n", "test3_true": "know, the ones who have been finding all those violations? \nMR. STOCKTON Manning! I said shoot them! \nLIEUTENANT MANNING I work for the Mayor, Terrence. \nMAYOR DIGGS Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence? \nPHIL Maybe because according to the paperwork you've got there, he owns Falconwood. \nCLARA Not only that, you'll see those other pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called Eurostruct - which rents the city all of its construction equipment. \nMR. STOCKTON Frank, Harry! Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns his gun on them. \nE \nPHIL The more violations Falconwood finds, the longer Eurostruct rents the equipment. That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor. I'm sure that's not a moral problem for you, but he's kind of screwing you in an election year, isn't he? Some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads. Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all \nMAYOR DIGGS You did this to me? I don't get it, Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I have the Lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs- \nMR. STOCKTON Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble at? Where I cover your debts? Those clubs? \nMAYOR DIGGS I slipped your company 5 no-bid foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown. \nMR. STOCKTON \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You think that pays for what I do for you? The girls I have to pay off? The jet charters? And let's not even get into your \"re-election fund\"! Let's not even go there! \nPHIL \n( `TIKES HEAD) Listen to them. Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck. \nMR. STOCKTON How did you get this? How? \nHOLBROOKE (O.S.) Tha be from me. Mr. Stockton and others turn around to see HOLBROOKE P_IF SON, brandi= --.g his gun and looking like the FBI he always -t e_' to be, leap -= a pack of Cher AGEN=IS as they JT OF THE L '_:I T\"_ : RIU? \nSTEPS. \nHOLEROOK E (CONT ' D ) FBI! Drop it! \nManning tried to object, pulling out his bad \nHOLBROOKE (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy. With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just revealed. \nMAYOR DIGGS Aw fuck. \nPHIL \n(SHRUGS) Makes you feel any better, I wasn't gonna vote for you anyway. \nCLARA either. \nEXT. FRONT OF PHIL AND CLARA'S HOUSE - MORNING \nAs Holbrooke drops Phil and Clara off in front of their house, his BLACKBERRY buzzes and he checks it. \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 CLARA Everything OK? \nHOLBROOKE Yeah. They just need me downtown in half an hour for a news conference with the Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning shows. \nPHIL Don't think they're going to be calling you the IT guy any-more. \nHOLBROOKE Listen guys, I feel weird about not even acknowledging you two. \nCLARA Don't. \nHOLBROOKE But you should be up there with me. You handed this whole case to me. \nPHIL (smiles, winks) Yeah, well-, that's how we roll. They get out of the car and start up the driveway. \nEXT. DOORSTEP - DAWN \nAs Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down, picking up the morning paper. \n"}

RIVERS s nothing personal. \n(BEAT) So let me get this straight. You're telling me that tomorrow I'm going to have to interview for the job I already have? Against George? \nMR. RIVERS I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need our pack leader to be more like... like a momma kangaroo. Ya get me? \nPHIL Kinda. \n(BEAT) Actually, no. Not really at all. \nMR. RIVERS The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle. But at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature. \nPHIL Sorry. Still not totally getting you. \nMR. RIVERS I've had a wife and a family. Three of them. It's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about. He can rip the meat. \nPHIL Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to... I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still... in the jungle! \nMR. RIVERS \n(BEAT) What does that mean? \nPHIL I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just can't. \nMR. RIVERS Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little... well... tame. \nPHIL \n(GETTING UP) That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers! I'll see you tomorrow. Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office. \nSCHOOL Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from school. \nCLARA So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our reservation's at 7:45. She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose. \nWithout breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini- bottle of Purell and cleans her hands. \nCLARA (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Mrs. Foster? Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot. \nCLARA Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you later. Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a warm smile. \nCLARA (CONT'D) I've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan. \nMRS. CARDIGAN I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries matter. \nCLARA 1\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd1 \nOK... \nMRS. CARDIGAN Can we speak a moment? Alone? \nCLARA Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car. As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Is everything OK? \nMRS. CARDIGAN Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately. Especially Jenny Diggs. \nCLARA Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's happening? \nMRS. CARDIGAN I'm going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out.

As he walks toward the house he spots the TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes his head. \nPHIL Unbelievable! \nINT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nStill carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who packs a suitcase. \nPHIL Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta tell you it's about time. \nOLLIE \nI'm going to Nana's tonight. \nPHIL On a school night? Why? \nOLLIE \n(SHRUGS) Mom says you guys are going out. \nPHIL Tonight? What?

Clara tns and smiles. \nIS \nCLARA I thought I could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in. A romantic dinner downtown like the old days, and teen...

Phil's surprised. \nCLARA (CONT'D) But we can't just tell you where they are. We have to take you to them. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - A LITTLE LATER \nIn the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the keys back to Harry. \nFRANK You drive with her in front. \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) So what's your plan here? \nCLARA \n(WHISPERS) I don't have a plan Phil. \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) You don't have a plan? \nCLARA E \n(WHISPERS) No. I was just trying to keep our knees for the time being. \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) Well, if we end up in that car with them we're as good as dead. \nFRANK Quiet! \nCLARA \n(WHISPERS) Well, any time you want to help... \nPHIL \n(WHISPERS) What's that supposed to mean? \nFRANK I said quiet! They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead. \nCLARA Phil? He drops to the ground. \nPHIL Whoa. \nCLARA Phil?

Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF \nCLARA (CONT'D) \n(CATCHING ON) You're diabetic! You never get the terms right, Phil! Oh no! This is bad, guys. \nPHIL I just can't... go any further. Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do. \nHARRY Should we call Mr. Stockton? \nFRANK Don't say his name, you idiot! \nHARRY Sorry! I was just- \nFRANK We'll just throw him in the back and have her show us. hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast. \nCLARA Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar. If you give it to me I can find it for him. With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages inside... and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her, she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground, whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at Harry. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Drop the gun and the keys. \nPHIL oa! Clara! No Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the gun. Harry looks at him, confused. \nHARRY Ow! Why, man? \nE \nPHIL Sorry. i was trying to knock you out. \nHARRY Why, \nPHIL ought that's what you do when- \nCLARA Phil! Just c'mon! \nPHIL \nUSHING OFF) Sorry.

POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM - A LITTLE LATER \nPhil excitedly chatters next to Clara at a table in an interrogation room in the police station. Across the table, a YOUNG POLICE OFFICER takes their statement \nPHIL We got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway- \nCL AAA the shortcut. \nPHIL What? \nCLARA \nUGS) I just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the highway. Your shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time. \n(BEAT) OK, are you going to tell the Policeman or and I gonna tell him? \nCLARA You can tell him. \nPHIL Because you always interrupt me when I try to tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow. \nCLARA Fine, you tell it. I won't say another word. \nPHIL Fine. \n(BEAT) See, now I've totally lost where I was. \nCLARA AND YOUNG POLICEMAN You got to the restaurant late- \nPHIT Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by the way, was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation. So we were at the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and over- \nCLARA Which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway. \n", "test2_id": 1291, "test3_input": "PHIL Oh God. \nCLARA How do we get out of here? \nINT. ING'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nManning talks in his off ice. \nE \nLIEUTENANT MANNING Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be contained. Right now.

Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside at the desk. \nLIEUTENANT MANNING \n(CONT'D) Where'd they go? \nOFFICER They said you were done with them. Manning walks quickly back to his office.

Spin it back now! \nCLARA just let me do it, She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb. \nCLARA (CONT'D) Dammit! I hate this! \nPHIL It's all right.

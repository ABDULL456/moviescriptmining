Connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute silence for just a moment. Suddenly his face reads the gravity of the situation. In a split second he turns into an animal. He's yelling, pulling, tugging and growling. 
His body is a whirlwind of motion. The skin on his wrists bleeds profusely. 
EXT. ALLEY  MORNING 
Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley. 
Murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster. Checkov has his gun to the boy's head. He acts like he's going to pull the trigger, but he stops. Vladdy is standing twenty feet away with his back to them keeping a look out, gun in hand. 
INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT.  MORNING 
Connor becomes so venomous, that he pulls the entire toilet right out of the floor. 
INT. TO EXT.  MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING 
(slo-mo) Connor steps out onto the sill of the huge, open loading doors. He is five stories up. His muscles ripple with the weight of the toilet. His face is barbaric. 
EXT. ALLEY  MORNING 
From his kneeling position, Murphy can see his brother perched 50 feet overhead. He does not let his face betray him. 
CHECKOV I hope your conscience is clear, Irishman. 
EXT. MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING 
(slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward and swings one arm directly beneath it. He is no longer tethered around the basin. He holds it at a cocked angle. 
The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet. 
He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory, then he jumps off the sill to the right. He is sailing through the air about twenty feet behind, and to the right of the toilet, cuffed hands above his head, robe up like a cape behind him. Murphy screams 
EXT. ALLEY  MORNING 
(slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily. The tank top lands pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits. 
Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious. 
Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence. 
He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a resonating boom. 
Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley. 
BACK TO PRESENT. INT. BOSTON POLICE STATION INTERROGATION ROOM  AFTERNOON 
Smecker stares astounded at Connor and Murphy. The boys examine Smecker for a reaction. He slowly builds to a chuckle. The brothers join in. 
SMECKER (gathering himself) 
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian? 
CONNOR We paid attention in school. 
SMECKER Know any other languages? 
MURPHY Aye. Our mother insisted on it. French. 
Murphy speaks flawless French with subtitles. 
MURPHY (subtitled) How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us? 
CONNOR Italian. 
Connor speaks flawless Italian with subtitles. 
CONNOR (subtitled) I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked. 
MURPHY German. (subtitled) Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period. 
CONNOR Spanish. (subtitled) Then I guess he's just real... real good. 
SMECKER What are you guys doing working at a fucking meat packing plant?

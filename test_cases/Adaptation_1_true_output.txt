ORLEAN (V.O.) An early surveyor made this entry in his field notes... 
EXT. SWAMP - DAY 
SUBTITLE: FAKAHATCHEE, ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER 
A surveyor scribbles in a notebook.   The pond is alive with alligators. 
SURVEYOR (V.O.) A pond surrounded by bay and cypress swamp, impracticable. Full of monstrous alligators, counted fifty and stopped. 
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Orlean lies in bed, wide awake and anxious. 
ORLEAN (V.O.) Whatever isn't wet in the Fakahatchee is blasted. The grass gets so dry that the friction from a car can set it on fire, and the burning grass can engulf the car in flames. A 1940's botanist noted: 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
A botanist, in a hot, arid field, writes in a notebook. 
BOTANIST (V.O.) Most impressed by the area's variety of squirrels...

CONTINUED: 
A car drives by on the dirt road. It begins smoking. The driver jumps out of the car just as it bursts into flames. 
BOTANIST (cont'd) 
... and charred automobiles. 
We pull back to see the area filled with abandoned, burned-up old cars. 
INT. MIAMI AIRPORT CAR RENTAL BOOTH - DAY 
Kaufman watches the pretty clerk working on the computer. She looks up, he looks down, studies his road map. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - EARLY MORNING 
A charmingly bedraggled Orlean drives on a road surrounded by swamp. She talks to us. 
ORLEAN The swamp's darkness and denseness can rattle your nerves. A sailor on a pluma- collecting expedition wrote in his diary: 
EXT. SWAMP - DAY 
SUBTITLE: FAKAHATCHEE, ONE-HUNDRED AND THREE YEARS EARLIER 
A luggish sailor sits in the distance on a stump, crying. 
SAILOR (V.O.) The place looked wild and lonely. About three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's nerves. We saw him crying, he could not tell us why, he was just plain scared. 
EXT. STATE ROAD 29 - EARLY MORNING 
Orlean drives onto the dirt road past the Fakahatchee sign and talks to us. 
ORLEAN The swampy part of the Fakahatchee is hot and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth snakes and diamond back rattlers and... 
INT. RENTAL CAR - MORNING 
Kaufman drives down the same road surrounded by swamp.

ORLEAN (V.O.) ... alligators and snapping turtles and poisonous plants and wild hogs and... 
EXT. RANGER SHACK - MORNING 
Orlean gets out of the car, knocks timidly on the shack door. Ranger Mike Owen answers. 
MIKE OWEN Charlie? 
It's Kaufman standing there. 
KAUFMAN (tremulous) Yes. Hi. 
EXT. SWAMP - MORNING 
The sky is overcast. Mike Owen leads Kaufman through a cool swamp, which is completely dry. The two men walk easily on peaty ground. Kaufman, slathered with sun screen and covered head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing, tries to be interested in Owen's lecture. 
MIKE OWEN So the whole ecosystem is six thousand years old. Five to six thousand years old. About that. Five or six. 
KAUFMAN Okay. 
MIKE OWEN Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all the cyrpess strands, probably in the world. I don't know of any cypress strand bigger. It's about twenty miles long, or nineteen, nineteen to twenty, nineteen... and right here it's about five miles wide, four and a half, five. So, again, it's twenty miles long, three to five miles wide. And over here --

He raises his right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand fluttering in the moonlight, like an organ with a will all of its own \nEmma is a sleep. There's a crucifix on the wall above her bed. On the bedside table there's a bible. \nEMMA \" ...About the midst of this valley I perceived the mouth of hell to be; and it stood also hard by the wayside.

NIGHT                             80 \nThe children are gathered around Emma who is reading a bed- time story to them by lamplight. \nEmma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive faces. \nShe's aware of Darwin, standing in the darkened corridor beyond the door, drawn to the cosy little group but unable to join it. \nShe lets him be.

In the darkness Etty says. \nETTY I think when Annie died he stopped loving us. \nEmma returns to her bedside \nEMMA Oh come now, Etty. You know that's not true. He is just a little bit ill - and a little bit busy. \n82   INT. BOILER ROOM.

How can there be? If he is supposed to be loving and forgiving - what on earth is the sense punishing all these millions of souls. \nANNIE But just suppose if there was. And all this was punishment. \nDARWIN All what? \nNo reply. \nDARWIN I don't know what you mean. All what? \n83   INT THE WATER TOWER.

He seems prematurely aged, crippled by the gruelling process of writing the book. \nAs he lies there, unable to sleep lines of written text seems to appear behind his closed eyes, or in the tangled vines of the wallpaper. \nEmma speaks from the other side of the bed. \nEMMA Talk to Mr Innes. Please. You are clearly not well \nDARWIN He is what? A physician now \nEMMA You know what I mean. I think he can help you. \nCharles remains stubbornly silent, his hand fluttering over the coverlet. \nEMMA I am taking the children to Maer for a while, to visit their cousins.

DAY                       101 \nParslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into space. \nThe page in front of him is still blank. \nThe study is in chaos. It seems as though the contents of the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize every corner of the room. \nPARSLOW Post for you sir. \nHe leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out. \nAfter a while Darwin seems to rouse himself. \nHe picks up the largest envelope, postmarked Malaysia, and slits it with a letter knife. \nThe sender is a Mr Wallace. There's a covering letter and a twenty page attachment Darwin reads, and lets out a sudden loud bellow of laughter. \nDARWIN Ha!! \n102   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                          102 \nDarwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house, rugged up against the cold. Looking frail still, but oddly at peace. \nINNES Ah, there you are Mr Darwin. \nDarwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky, dark-suited figure of Mr Innes. \nINNES May I join you. \nDARWIN By odd means \nHe makes some space on the bench. Innes hesitates, unable to read Darwin's feelings towards him. The smile is welcoming enough but there is something not altogether balanced about it \nINNES Mrs Darwin informed me you would be alone and ....perhaps a need to counsel. \nHe sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve it. \nINNES You dropped this. What a beautiful postage stamp. \nDARWIN Yes. It is from the Spice islands. \nINNES I do rather envy your wide circle of correspondents. In my youth I always wanted to travel. \nDARWIN You are still young. You could be a missionary and follow in Mr Livingstone's footsteps. \nINNES Yes, although I have always felt there is quite enough evil at home without looking for it abroad. (Then, casually) Mrs Darwin told me of the book you are writing. \nDARWIN Not any more, thank goodness \nINNES You have finished it? \nDARWIN It has been finished for me. My correspondent In the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea, expressed in a mere twenty pages. (MORE) \nDARWIN (cont'd) There's brevity for you. I had so far covered two hundred an fifty and come to a dead end. So finally I am rid of the project. \nInnes is relieved to hear it \nINNES The Lord moves in mysterious ways. \nDARWIN He does indeed Mr Innes. I was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa. \nInnes shifts uncomfortably. \nDARWIN And then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars \n", "test2_true": "DARWIN No. We can leave that for Mr Wallace now. Should I advise him to stay overseas do you think? If he shows his face in Kent he may be required to kneel on rock salt. \nInnes rises. He's a short man, acutely aware of any threats to his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery \nINNES I once valued our friendship Mr Darwin. I had hoped it might be possible to restore it. Clearly in your present mood that is not going to be possible. My regards to Mrs Darwin \nHe starts off round the corner of the house. \nDarwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his face back to the sun. When he opens his eyes sees a figure standing in the lawn. \nIt is Annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily. \nDARWIN What? I am forestalled by Mr Wallace. That is the simple fact of it. What reason do you have to be angry?! \nShe shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him and runs off towards the meadow. \nDarwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries after her. \nDARWIN Annie! \nHe reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and fells him to his knees. \nHe lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of the Wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to the wind. \nA view from high above: spiralling downwards on the Darwin garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters and hurry to his assistance. \n103   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY.                    103 \nThere are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the bedroom ceiling. Like lichen on a rock. Like an archipelago of islands. \nDarwin lies, pale and weak, looking upwards from a sea of white blankets. \nThe door opens and he turns his head. Its Emma. \nEMMA You have a visitor. \nDARWIN No. No. I will not be bled or lectured to. \nShe gives him a pinched look, then Hooker pushes in behind her. \nHOOKER It is me. Thank God you are still with us. Word came from London you had suffered an apoplectic stroke. \nDARWIN No. Simply the great relief of liberation. Did you read the Wallace abstract. \nHooker bats the idea away \nHOOKER It is a letter. You have a book \nDARWIN ...barely half of it \nHOOKER You have a book. What is not already on the page is most certainly inside your head and I intend to extract it, if it kills us both. \nDARWIN You have been talking to Huxley. \nHOOKER No. Had I done so he would have hastened here himself armed with every instrument of torture known to her majesty's navy. (Then) Charles I have read the first Chapters. It is brilliant. You must continue. \nDARWIN I cannot. Seriously Joseph, I am completely blocked. All my old symptoms have returned with a vengeance. The sweats the shakes the abdominal pains. The whole endeavour was cursed from the outset. \nHooker takes darwins hand, presses it to stop it from trembling \nHOOKER Charles. It was you who opened my eyes to the wonders of science. So let me open yours. You have an illness. You have had it as long as I have known you. (MORE) \nHOOKER (cont'd) It is clearly made worse in times of overwork but the nature of the work is irrelevant. This is not visited on you by God or the devil. This is a set of physical symptoms. Go to Malvern and get treated. \nDARWIN Not Malvern \nHOOKER Why not. What is there to be scared of there. He has worked for you in the past it will work again. Then come back and finish the book. Your enemies are already toasting their good fortune but they shall not prevail. \nDARWIN What are you talking about. I have no enemies. \nHOOKER They are legion, believe me, and they are implacable. We are all of us fighting a battle against fear and superstition but we can win this battle. We must win it. You can win it for all of us. Go to malvern, then come back and finish it. \n104   INT.

There's a plaintive cooing sound coming from the box next to his feet. \nDARWIN But every so often he'd open the lid and feed it, just because he couldn't bear to let it die. \nFinally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit. \nIt has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest. It takes the biscuit and peeps gratefully. \n154   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                          154 \nDarwin goes to the box and opens it.

It had escaped with all its babies, who were nesting all over the house making a terrible mess. \n155   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.

The house is in uproar. \nDARWIN But finally they caught them all, and bundled them in a blanket and he asked his wife to dispose of them as she saw fit. \n156   INT. STUDY.

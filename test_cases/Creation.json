DAY                                  1 \nIn darkness, chemicals wash over a copper plate. Strange silvery patterns evolve in the half-light. \n2   EXT. TERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                                      2 \nOur POV rotates downwards onto an irregular shape. \nThis shape is grey-green and crammed with detail which emerges as we draw close - like a continent seen from outer space. \nA fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a patch of lichen. \nA number of other fruit flies are grazing there. \nWider. The lichen is on a rock. A   black lizard climbs over the horizon - stalking flies. \nA slow advance. A sudden rush. A fly is snapped up and mashed between toothless gums. \nThe lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential victim when... \nA shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. A seabird grabs the lizard in its claws. Death is sudden and bloody. \nThe bird settles to eat. \nWhizz...Thunk. A sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and impales the bird through its wing. \nThe wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping helplessly. \nThe rest of the flock take to their air, calling and wheeling as... \nA crowd of local savages come racing over the larger horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows, spears, rocks and throwing-sticks... \nA child grabs the injured bird and kills it. \nAn adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird. \nThe rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock of birds. \nAND WE CUT TO \n3   EXT. COASTLINE. DAY                                           3 \nA POV shot through a telescope: The whirling birds the strange half-animal forms of the savages. \nThe whole scene is jerky, out of focus and inaudible at this great distance like a very old silent movie. \nCHARLES DARWIN (V.O.) In Terra del Fuego. The \"land of fire\" - A blighted and loveless country on the earths furthest rim - there lives a community of the dirtiest, the rudest, the least civilised beings you can imagine. \nThe telescope focusses. The image becomes a little clearer \n4   EXT. CLIFF TOP. DAY                                           4 \nThe flock of boobies fly out to sea. \nThe savages follow as far as the top of the cliffs, where they stop in sudden amazement, staring at a distant sailing ship. \nDARWIN (V.O.) They were all completely naked, the men as well as the women, with hair down to their bottoms. They spoke in grunts and they never washed their hands and faces! In many respects they resembled wild animals, except that animals are kinder to their children. \nA savage child makes a comment and gets biffed on the head again. \n11   INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE. DAY                                   11 \nJemmy Buttons, looking very smart in velvet suit with silver buttons gives proper bow and shakes the Royal hand. \nFuegia Basket curtsies. \nQueen Victoria remains out of shot but her attendants hand out presents off a purple silk cushion: A Bible for Fuegia and a telescope for Jemmy \n12   EXT. SHORE OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY.                          12 \nHairy savages reassemble on the cliff tops \nDARWIN Two years later. Captain Fitzroy and I took them back, in the company of a young Parson, hoping they would bring the other savages to god and to teach the others by example. \nThe hairy savages squint from the cliffs to sea.... \nAnother boat, the Beagle, has anchored in their bay. \nCaptain Fitzroy is being rowed ashore with Darwin, plus a very young parson and the two young Fuegans, who are happy and agitated to see their homeland again. \nDARWIN And what do you think happened? \n13   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. THE PAST. DAY.                      13 \nAnnie suspects there is a joke coming and cant help her mouth from twitching the corners. \nDARWIN (laughing) Correct! A complete and total failure! \n14   EXT. ROCKY CREVICES. TERRA DEL FUEGO. DAY                    14 \nAt the first sight of their countrymen, Jemmy and Fuegia rip off their clothes, drop the bible and the telescope, and run to join them, yelling like nut-cases. \nHAIRY SAVAGES YAAAAAH!! \nJEMMY/ FUEGIA Yaah!! Yahh!! \nThe benighted young parson scrambles after them, collecting their discarded garments from among the rain-swept rocks. \nPARSON Jemmy! Fuegia \nThe telescope is smashed. The Bible lies abandoned - the wind catching its soggy pages and whirling them off in the storm. \n15   INT. DAGUERROTYPE STUDIO. DAY.                               15 \nDarwin still laughing, dabs his eyes \nANNIE (laughing) Yaaah! \nThe photographer disappears behind black curtains. \nTECHNICIAN Very still now. No more talking please \nAnnie composes her face in an expression of angelic seriousness. \nA glass dome above her head glows snapdragon blue \nClose on Darwin watching his daughter, his eyes still damp with tears of laughter. \nElectricity hums. The strange blue light glows brighter, brighter... Brighter. \nThe image of his daughter imprints on Darwin's memory. Just so. Forever. \n16   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DINING ROOM. THE PRESENT. EVENING.          16 \nServants are laying a table for dinner \nGas lamps and the coal fire struggle to illuminate the lofty room. \nMrs Davies the Welsh cook, bangs the dinner gong and shouts across the darkening garden outside. \nMR DAVIES (O.S.) Children! Franky! Horace! Dinner! \nDarwins attractive wife Emma adjusts the lamps and the boys run in, Franky aged 10 Lenny aged 8 Horace aged 6. \nCHILDREN Can we take Mr Hooker to the Chalk pits. Why can't he stay. Can we pick blackberries? \nEMMA I think he is just here to work \n17   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.          17 \nA branch taps gently against the window pain, like an insistent guest demanding to be admitted. \nThe coal fire burns low in the grate - wind in the chimney rattling the damper \nFirelight flickers on a collection of finches in a glass case, on a bird skeleton, on a fossil, and on numerous specimen bottles containing the fleshy parts of barnacles preserved in spirit-of-wine. \nDarwin sits immobile in his chair, regarding a locked, black lacquered steel trunk, on the floor under his work table. \nA voice speaks behind him. \nANNIE Aren't you going to open it? \nHe turns and sees her sitting on the day bed - the same little bright eyed girl from the daguerrotype studio. \nShe's the same age as she was then and wearing the same checkered dress - though Darwin himself has aged ten years. \nDARWIN Maybe best if I just burn the whole lot. \nANNIE (horrified) No papa - You can't. I'm in it. \nDARWIN Don't be absurd. Of course you're not. \nANNIE The story of me when I was small. You showed me the pages. \nDARWIN Ah yes. \nANNIE \"The natural History of babies\" ...Remember? \nDARWIN Of course I remember. \nHe continues to stare at the shiny black box, his hand fluttering lightly - a nervous tic. \nMusic seeps in - a soothing Chopin Nocturne and.... \n18   INT. DOWN HOUSE DRAWING ROOM.   THE PAST. NIGHT               18 \nDarwin aged 40 - bright-eyed and inquisitive leans over to examine something, offering it his finger tip while making little tut tut tut noises. \nIn the cot is a one-month old baby. \nDARWIN Annie. Annie. Annie. \nThe piano music continuing over, as her fist closes round the end of his finger, then tries to pull it towards her mouth. \nHe pulls it away from her and she frowns. \nHe offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game. \nBaby Annie laughs. \nDarwin writes something in his notebook. Then tucks his pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial expressions - scowling, smiling - to gauge the baby's response. \nEmma turns on the piano-stool. \nEMMA (affectionately) What are you doing? \nDARWIN Just playing. \nShe comes over and, leaning against him, reads from his notebook. \nEMMA \"Six weeks: Gurgles. Holds tight to my finger. Tries to suck. Smiles at my smile\" \nThe baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure \nDARWIN I should add that she is musical. \nEMMA I hope you do not plan to treat all our children as little animacules to be included in your experiments. \nEmma, knowing her husband's ambivalence towards religion, casts him a slightly arch, amused look. Innes notices this, though he pretends not to. \nHooker returns from the river, looking slightly damp, with the rod which he has managed to retrieve \nHOOKER Everyone's a bit wet. Sorry, but the fish are surely biting. More worms, boys, more worms. \nGeorge is looking under stones \nHOOKER Try over there, Georgey, we've used all these ones up. \nThey move off, joining Annie and the other in their hunt for crawling things. The air above them is heavy and sparkling with pollen. \n21   EXT. OCEAN. NIGHT                                            21 \nA sailing ship sails past, trailing phosphorescence it its wake. \nDARWIN (V.O.) On the Beagle, quite, often we would drop a flask in the ocean and find it teeming with living particles which glowed in the night \n22   INT. SHIP'S CABIN. NIGHT                                     22 \nThe figure in silhouette of young Darwin inspects a flask of sea water, glowing in the darkness. \nHe takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on the illuminated stage of his microscope. \nUnder the microscope, against a black background, millions of tiny swimming animals. \n23   EXT. BY THE RIVER BANK. THE PAST. DAY                        23 \nCut to the air above the picnickers - alive with glittering particles - against the dark trees behind. \nDARWIN ....so much beauty for so little purpose. \nEMMA Surely not without purpose. They were helping to light the ship's way were they not. \nDarwin smiles at the idea, turns to Innes \nDARWIN Are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?. \nINNES He married his first cousin didn't he? \nEMMA So did Charles.... So did I. \nINNES Oh, I was not at all suggesting.... \nEmma waves it away. Just teasing \nDARWIN He made the point that if every trout, say, has a hundred offspring And so on and so on through the generations. Then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades. \nINNES Of course most of the eggs are destroyed and eaten so the numbers remain stable. That is the beauty of God's plan. \nEmma gives Darwin a \"So there\" look and hands Innes a sandwich. \nEMMA Cheese and cucumber \nINNES Thank-you \nSomewhere in the woods, Annie has found a treasure trove of worms and slugs. \nANNIE (O.S. DISTANT) Over here ....there are millions! \nDARWIN It doesn't strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan - these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished. \nEMMA (a gentle warning) Charles.... \nINNES (confidently) They are providing food for others. \nDARWIN You think they are happy about it? \nINNES Happy? \nClose up on a writing worm. Hooker is instructing George how to put a worm on a hook. \nHOOKER Through his bottom and up though his mouth - perfect \nBRODIE Once. But he went to Australia and I missed my chance. \nWilly passes the door, his hair in need of brushing. \nBRODIE Master William. Hairbrush. \nWilliam comes in. Brodie brushes the back of his hair. \nWILLY Ow. Ow! \nBRODIE Well what do you expect. It is a birds nest. \nWILLY Papa says God doesn't care if we are neat. \nBRODIE (brushing) Your father is a very wize man but has a small understanding of religion. No-one can read what goes down in Gods great book of accounts. ....Fingernails. \nWilly presents them for checking. \nBRODIE You can go. \n30   INT. HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY.                                  30 \nThe children come racing and swinging and clattering down the stairs. \nEmma, holding the baby in one arm, steers a tricycle out of the way, clearing a path to the door \nEMMA Mrs Davies, Will you ask Jenny to wear a bonnet. I would not like people to think her fast. \nGeorge aged 5 tugs at her skirt \nWILLY Can I bring my mouse for a blessing? \nEMMA What mouse? \nGeorge (5) pulls it out from his pocket. Its dead, muddy and bloody \nGEORGE Elsie caught it in the barn. We need to pray for his soul \nEMMA Mice don't have souls. Leave it on the window sill. Everyone come now or we shall be late. \n31   EXT. LANEWAY. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                       31 \nPealing of church bells \nMist rises from the ploughed fields and hangs among the ancient oaks. \nA little procession heads down the lane. The Darwins - Charles and Emma - plus their servants and children (older now, for we have flipped into the present), all in their Sunday best. \nThe trees are bare. Their breath condenses as they walk. \n32   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE PRESENT. DAY                         32 \nThe ancient flint church stands in the centre of Downe (sic) village, opposite the George and Dragon pub. \nA massive and venerable Yew tree casts its shade over a number of gravestones one of them inscribed \"to Mary Darwin born Sept 1842 died Oct 1842.\" \nBeyond the church fence, villagers greet each other before heading inside. The great majority of the village have turned out, from Squire Lubbock through the tradesmen and domestic servants from the village to the clodhoppers (farm labourers) in their colored smocks. \nRev Innes is welcoming his large flock at the gate. \nEMMA Reverend Innes. \nINNES (smiling) Ma'am. Welcome. Welcome \nThen his eye moves on to Charles Darwin and his smile falters, his expression turning slightly cold. \nDarwin tips his hat rather stiffly and walks away, through the throng of parishioners, leaving his family to file into the church without him. \n33   EXT. WOODLAND. PRESENT. DAY                                  33 \nDarwin walks across the meadow and into the woods. \nA flock of crows take flight from the rookery in the bare trees overhead. \nFRANKY ....and he wouldn't let you leave unless you agreed to marry his fattest daughter. \nHOOKER Yes. (Conspiratorial) ....but you are never to tell my wife that! \nEMMA Children leave Mr Hooker alone now. I'm sure he has more important things to discuss. \nHOOKER Not really, but I think Mr Huxley does.... \nHuxley has seen Darwin, washing his hands by the \"skeletonizing shed\". \nHuxley hangs back to introduce himself as Hooker steers Emma off into the house. \nHOOKER I have my heart set on a cup of tea and one of Mrs Davies' scones. \nEmma looks anxiously after Huxley but allows herself to be gently side-lined. \n37   INT. KITCHEN. THE PRESENT. DAY .                             37 \nEmma is by the kitchen window, rearranging tea things on a tray. \nThe sky outside is dark and lowering. \nThrough the window she can see Darwin heading off down the sand walk - head bowed, walking stick in hand - deep in conversation with Huxley. \nShe drops a tea-cup which smashes on the stone floor. \nMRS DAVIES I'll do that ma'am. Please. Let me do it. \n38   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE SAND WALK. THE PRESENT. DAY.            38 \nThe Sand-walk is a gravel walking path between the garden and the fields, flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows. \nHUXLEY We're reforming the Linnean. The committee will comprise myself, Lyell, Huxley...yourself of course if you are willing. \nDarwin grunts noncommittally. The Crunch crunch of their feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod walking stick. \nHUXLEY We intend to reclaim science as a profession - wrest it away from the country parsons and beetle- collectors. Your book will be our rallying point. \nDARWIN. You know it is not yet any fit state to publish. \nHUXLEY I have read your detailed abstract. The argument is complete and utterly compelling. All that is lacking is the detail and we know you have that in abundance. Your barnacle work has established you as the pre- eminent authority on marine life. \nDARWIN. On one small mollusc! \nHOOKER In which the whole story of creation can be read. Do not pretend to me that was not your intention. \nDARWIN. Honestly.... \nHUXLEY A \"family tree\" of barnacles stretching back 300 million years to the time it was a free swimming prawn!. \nDARWIN. There are many gaps. \nHOOKER Of course with gaps! But that is the very point. If we but had the complete fossil record we could trace all life back to one speck of protoplasm. The branching of forms in ever more complex succession...until. \nDARWIN. Yes yes, but one cannot infer too much. \nHOOKER Mr Darwin. Either you are being disingenuous or you do not fully understand you own accomplishment. You have killed God. \nDARWIN. Mr Huxley \nHUXLEY ....and good riddance to the bearded malicious old bugger! \nDARWIN (interrupts) Please I must beg of you.... \nHUXLEY No. I must beg of you sir. Joseph Hooker we know is too nice a chap to do it. You are a fine and brilliant man who hates to give offence - an admirable quality - wish I had it myself. But what do we believe? What do we know to be true. Will you light the way or leave us all to flounder in the mire for another decade. \nHe stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched. \nHOOKER Are you alright? \nDARWIN. A touch of indigestion. It will pass. \nIts clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him til the worst of it passes. \nDARWIN What are you doing, Annie? \nANNIE I'm making you beautiful. \nDARWIN I have to work. \nThough the soft touch of her little hands is almost too real for him to bear and he closes his eyes \nANNIE Breath in, papa. Breathe out. Now Tell me a story. \nDARWIN I have no time.... \nANNIE About Jenny. Please? \nThe sound of a wave breaking. Wind stirs Darwin's hair \nHe opens his eyes and he is .... \n42   EXT. ENGLISH BEACHSIDE. THE PAST DAY                          42 \nSitting with Annie ten years ago on an English pebble beach. \nShe has collected a pile of shells and is arranging them in \"families\". \nThe dialogue is continuous \nDARWIN Why do you always ask for Jenny? Its so sad. \nANNIE That's why I like it. It makes me cry. \nShe looks up from her shells and smiles winningly. \nDarwin looks out to sea, at the bright crashing line of surf, and begins the familiar, much-told tale: \nDARWIN Once apon a time there was a family of Orang-u-tangs living in the jungles of darkest Borneo \n43   EXT. JUNGLES OF BORNEO. DAY                                  43 \nOur POV moves between dark tropical trees to find a group of Orangutans flopping around grooming each other. \nAs with the land of the Fuegan savages, there is something slightly artificial about these jungles, as though the trees really belong in Kew gardens, and the naked jungle warriors, whom we now see stalking through them, are on loan from the museum of mankind. \nDARWIN Their eldest daughter was the most loving, caring and trusting Orang of all. \nWe follow a young nimble female, swinging through the trees, revelling in her own gymnastic ability, until she stops - hearing something: the sound of human speech. \nDARWIN But these qualities in themselves cannot guarantee an ape's survival. Sometimes, quite the reverse. \nNative hunters are creeping through the undergrowth \nA warning screech from one of the Orang-u-tangs posted as lookouts. \nMost of the apes flee up into the canopy. Jenny stays where she is, fascinated, just a moment longer than is prudent. \nDARWIN When she realized her danger it was too late. \nAs she turns to flee a weighted net is thrown on top of her. The hunters pounce. \nDARWIN They put her in a bag and carried her off.... \nANNIE \" much to her loving parent's sorrow.\" \nDARWIN Exactly. \nThe family screech and hoot, anguished, as the hunters head back off through the trees. \n44   EXT. MARKET-PLACE. DAY                                        44 \nExotic coins and bank-notes pass from hand to hand: from the tribal chief to the sultan, in his overlarge turban, from the sultan to the trader in his solar topee and stained white suit. \nDARWIN The hunters sold her the to the Sultan who promptly sold her to a visiting Englishman who packed her aboard a sailing ship and brought her to London zoo. \nJenny is taken out of a bamboo cage and put into a metal cage. \nJenny laughs waves a hand as if to say: \"Play, if it amuses you. I'm must kidding.\" \n47   EXT. THE BEACH. THE PAST. DAY                                 47 \nThe salt wind. The dazzling light. The slow pulse of the surf. \nDarwin has paused in his narrative. \nANNIE Go on papa. \nDARWIN Go on what. \nANNIE The bit where she gets sick and dies. \nDARWIN No. Why do you want to hear that bit? \nANNIE I just like it. It makes me cry. \nDarwin smiles, his own eyes filling with tears. \nThen a door opens, softly, in the sky. \n48   INT. THE STUDY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                            48 \nIt opens wider to reveal Emma's elegant profile, framed against the gaslight of the hallway. \nHer POV: the black box is unlocked and open, its contents strewn around the floor at darwins feet. \nDarwin is sitting on the floor of the study holding in his had a magazine, published by the Society for the useful Distribution of Knowledge, with a picture of Jenny on the cover \nEMMA Are you coming to bed? \nDARWIN Presently. \nHe doesn't move. She comes in \nEMMA What did Huxley want? \nDARWIN He thinks I should write it and be done with it. He feels it is a question of moral courage ...or the lack of it. \nEMMA You did not tell him about your health. \nDARWIN His theory is that I am making myself ill by holding back. That I should lance the boil. Plunge in and hang the consequences. \nEMMA Thank the Lord he is not a surgeon. \nDarwin takes a breath and plunges in himself: \nDARWIN I've concluded he is right. Bite the gag. Speed is everything. It will all be over in a matter of months. \nEmma is horrified. \nEMMA It is not mere months that concern me Charles. Nor even years or decades... \nIts said quietly but with genuine anguish. To Emma it is as though her life partner has announced he's contemplating suicide. \nEMMA Do you really care   so little for your immortal soul   - for the knowledge that you   and I may never be together,   in all of eternity. \nDARWIN (softly) You know that what concerns you concerns me also. What do think has held me in limbo all these years. \nEmma has. They both know it. She turns abruptly from the door and hurries away. \n49   INT. BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. NIGHT.                            49 \nEmma has been crying. She lies in bed pretending to sleep. \nDarwin gets into bed behind her. He wants desperately to reach out a hand to touch her, to comfort her, but he cannot do it for fear of weakening his own fragile resolve. \nDARWIN Dearest Emma. You know This is not a decision made lightly.... \n50   INT. DARWINS STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAWN                        50 \nIn the dawn light, Darwin is writing a letter to his wife. \nDARWIN We might find oysters and sponges imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if we were lucky... \nGEORGE What's a dinosaur? \nETTY Professor Owen invented them. \nDARWIN They are the giant lizards which lived on earth before there were any humans. \nBETTY But they weren't real \nDARWIN Of course they are, Betty. Did I never tell you of the skeletons I found in South America (to Etty) Do you remember Mr Martell? \nETTY No. \nAnnie arrives, hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her wet swimsuit \nANNIE Yes you do. When he came to tea and showed us drawings of his Iguanodon. And George burnt his fingers roasting chestnuts. \nETTY Oh yes. \nANNIE She doesn't remember. \nDARWIN You should have your clothes on Annie. You are quite blue. \nANNIE Savages don't swear clothes. \nShe runs to the top of a great fallen rock, spreads her arms out, and yells to the sky. \nANNIE I'm a Fuegan. \nDARWIN Well don't fall and hurt yourself. Your mother would never forgive me. \nAnnie gives a shout and disappears head over heels. \nDARWIN Annie! \nANNIE I've found one! \nIn the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed, unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a fossilized trilobite. \n60   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                        60 \nThe black box lies open with all its secrets strewn around the office. \nStacks of paper - a stack for every chapter - are held down with paperweights - a fossil, a skull, a specimen bottle. \nDarwin squares a stack of blank paper between his hands, then reaches for his pen. \n61   INT. VILLAGE SCHOOL. THE PAST . DAY.                         61 \nAnnie reaches for her pen. \nReverend Innes is giving the children their writing lessons, according to \"Mulhauser's technique\" \nINNES First positions. \nThe children assume the position as if in some militaristic drill. \nINNES Second positions. \nGrips are adjusted, pens are dipped. \nINNES Assume the distance. \nThe children lean back fractionally, so their elbows are just back from the edge of the desk. \nINNES .....and begin. \nThe Children start to copy the sentence which Innes has written on the blackboard. \nAnnie reads the sentence and hesitates: \"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested\" \n62   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY.                                    62 \n78   INT. HELL.                                                   78 \nA vision of hell: \nThe water is fire. \nThe barnacles are people. \nThe people are Annie, Emma and Darwin. \n79   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                          79 \nDarwin wakes in a panic and sits up in bed. He raises his right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand fluttering in the moonlight, like an organ with a will all of its own \nEmma is a sleep. There's a crucifix on the wall above her bed. On the bedside table there's a bible. \nEMMA \" ...About the midst of this valley I perceived the mouth of hell to be; and it stood also hard by the wayside. Now, thought Christian, what shall I do? \n80   INT. NURSERY. THE PRESENT. NIGHT                             80 \nThe children are gathered around Emma who is reading a bed- time story to them by lamplight. \nEmma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive faces. \nShe's aware of Darwin, standing in the darkened corridor beyond the door, drawn to the cosy little group but unable to join it. \nShe lets him be. Continues reading \nEMMA And ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with sparks and hideous noises, that he was forced to put up his sword, and betake himself to another weapon, called \"All Prayer\"...\" \n81   INT. ETTY'S ROOM NIGHT.                                      81 \nThe older girls Etty and Betty finish their prayers and jump into bed in their night-gowns \nEmma comes in to take away their lamp. \nETTY Is Daddy not coming to kiss us good-night \nEMMA He is still a little bit ill from working ...maybe tomorrow. \nBETTY That's what you said last night. \nEmma turns out the light. In the darkness Etty says. \nETTY I think when Annie died he stopped loving us. \nEmma returns to her bedside \nEMMA Oh come now, Etty. You know that's not true. He is just a little bit ill - and a little bit busy. \n82   INT. BOILER ROOM. DAY                                        82 \nIn the bowels of Down House the house, we find Darwin wrapped in wet towels sweating in front of the wood-burning stove. \nAs he gazes into the leaping flames, Annie appears at his shoulder. \nANNIE Is there really such a place as hell. \nDARWIN No of course not. How can there be? If he is supposed to be loving and forgiving - what on earth is the sense punishing all these millions of souls. \nANNIE But just suppose if there was. And all this was punishment. \nDARWIN All what? \nNo reply. \nDARWIN I don't know what you mean. All what? \n83   INT THE WATER TOWER. DAY                                     83 \nDarwin stands, legs apart in the water tower bracing himself like a colossus against the full force of the deluge. \nDARWIN Pull! \nDarwin trying, to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of locals who hail him and gather around him, wedging him into a corner with their overloud loud talk and laughter. \nTHATCHER Mr Darwin! Mr Darwin! I was explaining to Mr Goodman here your interest in breeding. Mr Darwin is our foremost scholar in the village. \nDARWIN No. No I am but one of many. There is Squire Lubbock, and the reverend Innes \nThe Thatcher waves them away as lesser talents. \nTHATCHER ....he is also a noted explorer, the author of many books.. \nDARWIN ...which no-one has read. \nTHATCHER ...a fellow of the Royal society and a prodigious expert on clams...oysters? \nDARWIN Barnacles. \nTHATCHER Mr Goodman, now, is the foremost pigeon fancier in all the southern counties. Kent champion two years running. I swear he can give you any beak or plumage in four generations. Head and tail in five. \nDARWIN How do you do it? \nGOOODMAN By breeding cousin with cousin. I find it the fastest way to alter the strain - provided you do not weaken it in other ways. \nDarwin takes a slug of whiskey \n93   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY.   THE PRESENT. NIGHT                     93 \nHe is drinking in his office. \nThe clock strikes twelve. The page in front of him remains stubbornly blank \nDarwin is rising from his desk when he sees something move. \nIn one of the bottles on his desk, a fleshy marine specimen seems to have come to life. \nIt writhes blindly in its bottle of formalin, making a sound like a baby crying. \nDarwin, recoiling in horror, pushes himself back from his desk. The castors on his chair trundle back from his desk. \nBehind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the birds in his big glass display case of Galapagos finches have started to beat against the inside the crowded glass case. They flutter, frenzied, tapping with their beaks on the inside of the glass, which shatters as... \nOne by one the bottled specimens explode, discharging their contents onto the floor. \nA lamp falls over. The room is filled with birds the floor awash with formalin and broken glass. \nThe Study seems to tilt like the cabin of a ship in a storm and. \n94   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN                     94 \nDarwin wakes from the nightmare asleep at his desk, the whiskey bottle a quarter empty, ink on his hands and his shirt cuffs \nHe gets up and puts on his shoes. \n95   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN .           95 \nThe scullery maid, lighting the fire, looks round and sees Darwin. \nHe walks past her without a word and heads out into the garden. \n96   EXT. DOWN HOUSE GARDEN. THE PRESENT. DAWN                    96 \nDarwin heads across the lawn, takes a key from his belt and opens the door of the skeletonizing shed. \n97   INT. SKELETONIZING SHED. THE PRESENT. DAWN                   97 \nIn the grey light he takes in the corpses of doves from the dovecote. \nSome have been skinned, their pelts curing on frames, their carcasses steeping in a buckets chemicals which remove the flesh from the bones. \nPreviously he regarded this place as a sort of laboratory. Now it seems a place of horror. \nThe door opens behind him. Its Parslow. \nDARWIN Get rid of them. \nDARWIN I should take her to Malvern. \nEMMA I think it is better she is here. \nDARWIN Gully can care for her properly there. She can be treated daily, as I was. \nEMMA Charles no. She is better with us. With her family. Please do not take her away from me. \n101   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                       101 \nParslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into space. \nThe page in front of him is still blank. \nThe study is in chaos. It seems as though the contents of the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize every corner of the room. \nPARSLOW Post for you sir. \nHe leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out. \nAfter a while Darwin seems to rouse himself. \nHe picks up the largest envelope, postmarked Malaysia, and slits it with a letter knife. \nThe sender is a Mr Wallace. There's a covering letter and a twenty page attachment Darwin reads, and lets out a sudden loud bellow of laughter. \nDARWIN Ha!! \n102   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                          102 \nDarwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house, rugged up against the cold. Looking frail still, but oddly at peace. \nINNES Ah, there you are Mr Darwin. \nDarwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky, dark-suited figure of Mr Innes. \nINNES May I join you. \nDARWIN By odd means \nHe makes some space on the bench. Innes hesitates, unable to read Darwin's feelings towards him. The smile is welcoming enough but there is something not altogether balanced about it \nINNES Mrs Darwin informed me you would be alone and ....perhaps a need to counsel. \nHe sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve it. \nINNES You dropped this. What a beautiful postage stamp. \nDARWIN Yes. It is from the Spice islands. \nINNES I do rather envy your wide circle of correspondents. In my youth I always wanted to travel. \nDARWIN You are still young. You could be a missionary and follow in Mr Livingstone's footsteps. \nINNES Yes, although I have always felt there is quite enough evil at home without looking for it abroad. (Then, casually) Mrs Darwin told me of the book you are writing. \nDARWIN Not any more, thank goodness \nINNES You have finished it? \nDARWIN It has been finished for me. My correspondent In the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea, expressed in a mere twenty pages. (MORE) \nDARWIN (cont'd) There's brevity for you. I had so far covered two hundred an fifty and come to a dead end. So finally I am rid of the project. \nInnes is relieved to hear it \nINNES The Lord moves in mysterious ways. \nDARWIN He does indeed Mr Innes. I was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa. \nInnes shifts uncomfortably. \nDARWIN And then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars \nDarwin untucks his shirt. Gully prods at Darwin's belly. Darwin winces. \nDR GULLY Pulse hectic, togue furred, liver tender and enlarged. \nDarwin's ink stained fingers speak volumes. \nDR GULLY No doubt you have been exercising your brain every hour that God gave you. \nDARWIN I was persuaded to write book. \nDR GULLY Madness there are far too many of those already. Are you Sleeping? \nDARWIN Poorly. \nDR GULLY I suppose never taking the 50C dilution of Chelidonium. \nDARWIN (shakes his head) I had the gardener build a water tower. It no longer has any effect. \nGULLY Of course not. Your gardener is not a hydrotherapist. What on earth possessed you ? \nDARWIN I feared I was dying. \nDR GULLY Oh come come come. We shall not have that talk here. \nHalf turning to his assistant, who is staking notes. \nGULLY A smart spinal scrub. Cold douche daily at 7.00. Wrapping in towels and sweating by the lamp. \nThen, to Darwin: \nDR GULLY No red meat, no reading, no mental agitation of any kind. We shall soon have you right old friend, we shall have you right. \n114   INT. TREATMENT ROOMS. DAY                                    114 \nMusic over: \nDarwin sits in a deep metal bath while one of Gully's assistants scrubs his spine with a loofah. \n115   INT. DOUCHE. DAY                                             115 \nDarwin stands in a shaft of light, grabbing onto the hand rails as the icy flood continues to crash down on his shoulders, splintering and fracturing in the shaft of light. \n116   INT. TREATMENT ROOMS. DAY                                    116 \nTwo assistants bind him tight in damp linen sheets, til he is immobilised like a cocoon, with his legs together and his hands by his side. \nThey pick him up and lie him down, quite rigid beside another pod like creature, similarly swaddled, with a red face and a beard. \nBEARDED STRANGER Mr Darwin is it? \nDarwin nods, unable to turn his head, or make any gesture with his hands. \nThe stranger continues to talk to him nonetheless. \nBEARDED STRANGE William Carter of Southampton. I read your Beagle account many years ago. Former naval man myself. What brings you here? Myself, a Bilious fever with blood per rectum, but I have every faith in Gully. The man is a miracle worker. \n117   INT. TREATMENT ROOM. DAY                                    117 \nDarwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders, under the merciless glare of a heat lamp. \nSweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet. \n118   EXT. TERRACE. DAY.                                          118 \nA bright sunny day. Darwin, looking weak but purged, sits on the terrace, sipping a glass of foul-tasting mineral water and looking out over the stone houses, fields and valleys of Malvern. \nGully sits with him, interviewing him. \nGULLY What action do you most associate with the symptoms. Eating? Strong emotion? Strenuous Excercise? \nDARWIN Does the exercise of memory count as an action. \nGULLY Memory of what. \nMr St John' face hardens. \nMRS ST JOHN (coldly) I'm a professional lady Mr Darwin. I don't do party tricks. \nDARWIN I am a professional man. And I asking for no more than I ask of all my colleagues - a demonstration of competence. \nMRS ST JOHN It is you who are here to be tested, Sir, not me. \nDARWIN Then I am sorry to have wasted your time. \nHe puts his jacket back on and heads for the door. \n121   INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.                                       121 \nMrs St John follows him. As he reaches for the doorhandle, and opens it, she says: \nMRS ST JOHN She's with you, you know that. \nDarwin turns. \nMRS ST JOHN Your little girl. I saw her from the window standing at the top of the steps. \nDARWIN How dare you. \nMRS ST JOHN Pardon? \nDARWIN ...prey on people's grief like this. \nMRS ST JOHN I have done no such thing. \nDARWIN (furious) Do you take me for an idiot? Clearly Gully has appraised you of my history. \nMRS ST JOHN I beg to inform you he did no such thing! \nDARWIN It is chicanery of the very lowest order and I despise it utterly! \nMRS ST JOHN Get out. \n122   EXT. THE HOUSE. DAY                                           122 \nDarwin steps outside and she slams the door on him. Darwin continues to rant at the closed door, standing in the pouring rain without his umbrella. \nHe gets to the top of the steps, and looks around, trying to get his bearings. \nIn a pool of lamp-light at the far end of the street a figure stands watching him. \nDarwin squints at her through the rain, which is falling harder now. \nThe figure is Annie. \nShe looks at him crossly, then heads off up a cobbled side- street. \nDarwin follows. \n123   EXT. MALVERN. SIDE STREETS. VARIOUS. NIGHT                    123 \nDarwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes. \nDARWIN Annie. Annie! \nThe rain is getting heavier, turning the gutters into rivers. \nWater overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the cobbles, making them slick and treacherous. \nDarwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys, the sound of rushing water echoing all around, the little girl always ahead of him. \nA DRUNK MAN in oilskins comes barreling past him, head down, cursing the weather. \nA child's ball goes floating downhill in the current. \nDarwin loses Annie, then he sees her again, at the top of a steep flight of stone steps. \nDarwin, drenched chases after her. \nThe older Darwin, hesitates, chest pounding, outside the door of number 14, then unlocks it as... \n131   INT. GUESTHOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                              131 \nThe younger Darwin bursts into room 14 and takes in the scene. \nThe room is full if light. A maid is bundling soiled sheets. Brodie is there with a harrassed-looking Dr Gully. \nThey turn as he enters. \nAnnie lies on the bed between them, her breathing fast and shallow. She manages a weak smile. \nDARWIN Is she any better? Does she want for anything? \nGully stands up from the bed. His expression tells us hope is fading. Annie's pale sunken cheeks and caked lips confirm it. \nDarwin kneels by her bedside, clasps her little hand is his own. \nDARWIN Darling Annie. I am here now. \nAnnie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes his lapel \"making him beautiful\" \nBrodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears. \n132   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST NIGHT.                               132 \nAnnie sleeps. \nDarwin sits up, writing to Emma, crying as he writes. \nDARWIN (V.O.) Dearest Emma. I think it best for you to know how every hour passes. It's a relief for me to tell you. Whilst writing to you I can cry tranquilly. \n133   INT. ROOM 14. THE PAST DAY.                                  133 \nA local surgeon lays out various instruments, including a glass syringe with a long needle. \nAnnie struggles and whimpers. Brodie comforts her \nDARWIN (V.O.) Mr Coates the Surgeon came today to draw off Annie's water. This did not hurt her, but she struggled with surprising strength against being uncovered. \nBRODIE There there. It will all soon be over. \n134   EXT. CHURCH AT MALVERN. ENTRANCE. DAY                        134 \nDarwin enters through the heavy stone entrance. \n135   INT. THE CHURCH AT MALVERN. DAY                              135 \nThe relatives of the sick, stand or sit among the pews, arriving, praying, departing \nDarwin kneels awkwardly in front of the altar, clasps his hands together and prays: \nDARWIN Save her. I will believe whatever. Forever. Please save her \nHe looks up at the image of Christ on the cross, hoping against all reason, for some sense of epiphany. \nIt's not working. He feels nothing embarrassment at the cheapness of the gesture. \n136   INT GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14.   THE PAST .NIGHT                  136 \nDarwin sits alone with Annie who is babbling incoherently. He can't make out anything she says \nDARWIN (V.O.) Our dear child has taken a turn for the worse. She talked a great deal but we could seldom make out anything. Much of what she says we cannot make out from the roughness of her poor mouth. \n137   INT. GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14 NIGHT                             137 \nDr Gully leaves, the surgeon arrives. The maids squeeze between the two medical men, bundling sheets \nDARWIN (V.O.) Today she vomited rather much again. Dr Coates has been to draw off more water. \nBrodie and the maid roll Annie on her side and cut off the tail of her shirt, then roll her on her back again, with a pillow between her two bony knees. \nDARWIN Is that good, my lovely \nShe doesn't notice the figure of Darwin until he appears, like a ghost, reflected in the polished wood of the piano. \nShe turns with a start and sees him, still in his dripping coat, hair plastered over his brow \nDARWIN Sorry. I startled you. \nEMMA Take your coat off by the fire there. What time is it? \nDarwin stays where he is, dripping on the carpet \nDARWIN We need to talk. I need to talk to you. \nEMMA Of course, but dry your hair. I shall call for a towel. \nAs she moves to the bell-pull he grabs her wrist \nDARWIN I went back to Worcester Road. I saw Annie. \nEMMA Charles. No. \nDARWIN Let me tell you. \nEMMA I don't want to hear it. This must stop. \nDARWIN You don't understand. \nEMMA I do! Do you think me deaf and blind. You have lived with her and spoken with her every day since she died. \nParslow comes in with firewood then sees Emma yelling at darwin and hurriedly retreats, spilling logs in the hallway. \nEMMA She is more real to you than I am. She's dead Charles. \nDARWIN I know that. \nEMMA Then what is wrong with you that even our poor daughter cannot be left in her grave but you would.... \nDARWIN I know she is dead. I know it. It is you who will not accept the fact, preferring to think of her in heaven. \nThis again! The unspoken argument which has been brewing for a decade, never before expressed so bluntly. Emma heads for the door \nEMMA Get away from me! \nShe heads into the hallway, he follows her ranting \nDARWIN Snowy white wings and dancing with the angels. Is that your idea of honesty. \nServants scramble out of sight and out of earshot \nEMMA Why did you come back. I will not hear this! \nEmma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs. Darwin pursues her. \nOn the landing, Betty and Horace, wide eyed and terrified are bundled into the nursery by Brodie as Charles thunders up the stair. \nDARWIN You have to Emma, everything these was between us is gone. The boat is wrecked and sunk now. We have to hold to something else. \nEMMA To what. Your ghosts? Your theories? What Charles. \nCHARLES To the truth of what we know it. \nShe slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it. \nDARWIN Open this door Emma. The truth, how wonderful and extraordinary our daughter was.... \nEMMA (through the door) I know that. I do not need you to say it. Of course I know. \nCharles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through it. Emma screams \nCHARLES But free of the fantasy, free of the rest, the silly vain hope that we will be reunited in heaven and the nagging unspoken belief that I killed her! \nIn the lower hallway all the servants hear this \nIn the nursery, Brodie, aghast, covers the childrens ears \nDARWIN ...I wont hurt you. \nHe reaches into the dark recesses of the forest. Darwin grabs it and stuffs it, squawking into his collecting bag. \n152   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY NIGHT                                     152 \nDarwin comes in, empties the bag into a black box with perforations and closes the lid \nDARWIN He knew his wife wouldn't care for this creature so when he came home he locked it in a box, where it couldn't run around and do any damage. \n153   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                      153 \nDarwin works at his desk. There's a plaintive cooing sound coming from the box next to his feet. \nDARWIN But every so often he'd open the lid and feed it, just because he couldn't bear to let it die. \nFinally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit. \nIt has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest. It takes the biscuit and peeps gratefully. \n154   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                          154 \nDarwin goes to the box and opens it. There's nothing there but an empty nest and some broken eggshells. \nDARWIN One day he opened the box and discovered it wasn't in there at all. It had escaped with all its babies, who were nesting all over the house making a terrible mess. \n155   INT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY. VARIOUS                                 155 \nThe Darwin's, their children and their servants run around the house finding birds everywhere. \nThere is bird-shit on the curtains and the antimacassars, birds nesting in the sewing basket, the bread bin and the dress-up box. \nEvery time you open a cupboard, angry birds fly out and flap angrily around the room. \nMayhem. The house is in uproar. \nDARWIN But finally they caught them all, and bundled them in a blanket and he asked his wife to dispose of them as she saw fit. \n156   INT. STUDY. CONTUNUOUS                                       156 \nAnnie listens entranced. Darwin pauses \nANNIE And what did she do? \nDARWIN I don't know but I fancy she took them out in the garden and set them free. \n157   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. GARDEN DAY.                                 157 \nEmma and Brodie come out carrying a huge white linen bag between them. \nThey shake it out in the garden and birds come pouring out of it. \nHigh shot, looking down on EMMA as she watches the birds wheeling round and round in the sky above. \n158   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                     158 \nDarwin sits in his study window, watching a great flock of birds wheeling in the sky outside, the whole flock forming an ever-changing shape from the movement of its tiny component parts. \n159   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT                                    159 \nDarwin puts down his pen, waking, as if from a dream. \nThe manuscript is finished. \nThe music of Chopin filters up from downstairs. \n160   INT. DRAWING ROOM. DAY                                       160 \nEmma is playing by candle-light. Darwin places the manuscript on top of the piano. \nShe stops abruptly. The last chord resonates in the musky air. \nDARWIN Done. I have finally got it out of the air and into these pages. Will you read it and decide what must be done with it. I confess I no longer know and I am very tired. \n", "test1_input": "The church beadle comes out behind him. \nBEADLE Are you all right, sir? \nDARWIN Never better. Thank-you. \nHe heads off up the gravel path \n55   INT WOODLANDS. THE PRESENT. DAY                               55 \nThe faint and Distant sound of church singing filters through the misty woods. The black wet trunks of trees catch the sunlight. \nFrosty dew highlights Mistletoe and holly and dead bracken and the sudden red flash of a robin. \nDarwin cuts a strange dark angular figure, walking along the narrow track a single step at a time. \nHe pauses breathing, and listens. \nHis quick eye catches the robin seizing a worm. \nFurther on. A pheasant breaks cover. A hare stands upright in a clearing then bounds away. \nDarwin looks down and takes another step, placing his feet carefully, silently so as not to disturb the wildlife. \nCut to a different pair of much newer shoes in exactly the same spot. \n56   INT. WOODLANDS. THE PAST. DAY                                 56 \nDarwin is ten years younger, pacing in the same, measured way through summer woodland. \nThere's a noise behind him and he turns, finger to his lips for silence. \nAnnie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line of children: Etty, George, Betty and Franky, in decreasing order of height. \nANNIE Shh \nFRANKY (to ANNIE) What are we looking at? \nThe question comes back up the line \nDARWIN A weasel. \nThe children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful sight. \nIn a little sun-dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit of... \n...a young rabbit, which sits utterly hypnotized by the performance. \nAt first its strange and amusing, then the dance becomes more sinister. The weasel advancing by tiny increments as it tumbles in the air, finally \nANNIE NO! \nThe weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck and shakes it savagely. \nThe rabbit shrieks and spasms. \nAnnie is beside herself, drumming the ground with her feet in a fever of fear and pity. \nThe rabbit is still in its dearth throes, its neck broken, its back legs still jerking \nANNIE No! No! Stop it. Daddy. Stop it. Make it stop. \nThe rabbit is already dead. \nDARWIN Annie, Annie, Annie. \nHe sinks to his knees, heedless of the mud on his Sunday best worsted, embracing her. \nThe others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death, but none of them distressed as Annie. They are country children and death is an everyday event \nGEORGE The chickens do that too when cookie kills them \nANNIE (tearful furious) Chickens are different!

Chest still heaving with sobs - she dries her eyes and smiles at him through her tears. \n57   INT. DOWN HOUSE. BEDROOMS. THE PAST .NIGHT .                 57 \nPiano music - Chopin - plays softly over as Charles and Emma do the rounds of their large brood of children, turning out lamps and kissing sleeping heads, taking a doll from one sleeping child's embrace, a sword from another. Shooing a cat and her kittens from the bedroom. \nEMMA Good-night Lenny. \nDARWIN \nGood-night Frankie \nEMMA Good-night Betty. \nDarwin watches his wife, a sensuous figure, stooped over the sleeping child, a lock of hair falling forwards as she kisses her. \nDARWIN Good-night George \nEMMA Good-night Etty. \nDARWIN Good-night Willy \nDARWIN AND EMMA Good-night Annie \nShe's sound asleep. Finally Charles and Emma are alone together in the blissfully silent house. \nEmma smiles \nEMMA Dear Charles \nDARWIN Dearest Emma \nHe takes her hand and leads her to their bedroom. \n58   EXT. THE BEACH. THE PAST. DAY                                 58 \nEmma lies on a rug, her head is in Darwin's lap. She is reading aloud from a new book of poems by Wordsworth. \nEMMA \"Loving she is, and tractable though wild. And innocence hath privilege in her. To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes; And feats of cunning; and the pretty round Of trespasses, affected to provoke Mock chastisement, and partnership in play\" \nShe puts the book down \nDARWIN (smiling) Then we were wrong. She is not unique after all. \nDarwin is watching Annie dancing in front of the surf , turning cartwheels - a wild dancing sprite of the sea, oblivious to the cold, shouting and singing: \n59   THE BEACH. LATER                                              59 \nLater, Near the cliff, Darwin is \"geologising\" \nHe's excited, breathless and windswept, shouting over the sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his kids who are more interested in clambering. \nDARWIN This is Devonian, about 400 million years ago. Rocks like this might have fishes in them, trilobites, tree ferns, corals maybe.... \nHe knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer, then moves on \nETTY Is this a bit? \nDARWIN No that is Cretaceous Etty. It was made a hundred millions years ago, when this cliff was a coral reef and Down village was a swamp full of great crocodiles. \nTap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards, playing at mountaineers. \n", "test2_input": "DARWIN (his arm is stuck) In his rights to torture our children for expressing the plain truth. \nBrodie appears and Darwin ushers Annie towards her \nDARWIN                           EMMA ...Please take her to           It is not the truth as he kitchen.                        sees it \nDARWIN Well damn how he sees it. Damn the pair of them and all their works \nEMMA Charles listen to yourself. Listen \nBlocking his path as he heads for the door. Her palm flat on his lapel, soothing, reasoning with him \nDARWIN Emma please. I will not have Innes tell me what I can and cannot tell my children. \nEMMA It is what I have told them every night at bedtime. It is the instruction my aunt and your brother and most of our family live by. It is what all of the village believe ...or try to. Charles. Must our children be revolutionaries at nine years of age. Write to him with your concerns - our concerns - about the manner of the punishment but please do not set yourself against him. Think of my feelings on this. I beg you. \nFinally his outrage has spent itself, neutralized by her gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her. \nDARWIN You're right of course.... I'm sorry. \nHe embraces her. \nEmma is reassured, she cannot see the conflict written all over Darwins face. \n65   INT. STUDY. DAY. (THE PRESENT)                                65 \nThe conflicted expression has hardened, the furrows in Darwin's brow etched deeper, as he dips his pen and begins the second chapter. \nFrom the floor below we can hear Emma practising a piece of music on the piano - Chopin's revolutionary etude: a rippling, brooding arpeggio running up and down the keyboard, redolent of an angry sea. \nDarwin's pen scratches doggedly over the paper. \n66   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                                          66 \nIn the bedroom, in his nightgown, Darwin scrubs the ink stains off his fingers with a pumice stone. \nEmma passes behind him, preparing for bed. He glances at her in the mirror \nDARWIN You're still angry with me. \nEMMA No. Why? \nDARWIN I can always tell by your playing. \nEMMA Not angry. I'm sad. \n67   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                         67 \nDarwin sits at his desk, writing and editing, his hand clamped on the pen. \nA voice speaks from nowhere \nANNIE Talk to her. \nDARWIN (still writing) And say what? She does not want to hear it. \nANNIE Then write to her. \nDARWIN (irritably) That is what I am doing Annie, I am writing all of it. \n68   EXT. DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY                                    68 \nEmma, passing the open door glimpses Darwin talking angrily to himself as he writes. \nDARWIN ....and then she can read it, and we can all be free of this! Now, please, Annie no more interruptions! \n69   EXT. GARDEN. DAWN                                           69 \nThe music continues, louder. \nA frosty coating of dew covers the lawn. \nFootprints lead to a strange wooden tower in the garden. Parslow stands outside, shivering in the grey morning light. \n", "test2_true": "DARWIN Pull! \nParslow pulls a lever. \nThere's the sound of crashing water, a yell of pain from inside the tower. \nRavens rise, calling, from the surrounding trees. \n70   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT. DAY                       70 \nDarwin dips his pen, scores out some text from his previous draft and writes again. \nThe music continues from downstairs, louder and more insistent than before. \n71   LOUNGE ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY                               71 \nEmmas hands race back and forwards along the piano keyboard. \n72   INT DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT                             72 \nDarwin's pen scratches across the pages, making a noise like fingernails on a blackboard. \nThe music from downstairs seeming to drive into his skull \nHe speaks aloud the words he is writing, in an effort to drown out the piano music. \nDARWIN (THOUGHT VOICE) ... In time small variations become extreme... \nStrange detailed drawings of barnacles are strewn across his desk, seeming to change and transmute before his eyes. \nDARWIN (V.O.) ...Organs change their very function, the oviduct becomes a cement gland. \nHe stops. His hand is shaking too much to write. \nANNIE What's an oviduct? \nDARWIN Nothing that need concern you. \nANNIE (sulkily) I know what it is anyway. \nDarwin gets up abruptly from his desk. \n73   INT. WATER TOWER. DAY                                        73 \nDARWIN Pull! \nDarwin stands naked, clutching to two hand rails for support as a great tub of freezing water tilts and pours its contents on top of him. \nDarwin yells \n74   EXT DOVECOTE                                                 74 \nBirds rush out from the dovecote \n75   INT. STUDY                                                   75 \nDarwin dips his pen and writes \nDARWIN ....What was once a free- swimming creature now finds itself glued by its head to a rock, flailing for food with its legs..., \nThe Revolutionary etude is continuous now - real or imagined. \n76   UNDER THE SEA                                                76 \nSurf crashes. \nUnderwater, among the swirling seaweed, fragile sea creatures being torn this way and that by the raging surf \n77   INT. MALVERN SPA TREATMENT ROOM. DAY                         77 \nAnnie screams and kicks her legs, overwhelmed by water in some dark place. \nPull back to reveal: \n", "test3_input": "Upstairs, Servants are packing for a journey. \nThe vigorous Darwin of the past moves swiftly from room to room, gathering his things. Hat and gloves, books, spectacles, papers. \nEmma, eight months pregnant, tries to keep up with him \nEMMA Charles, please reconsider \nCHARLES Emma it is weeks now, months. She is getting worse, not better. \nEMMA Then I am coming with you. \nDARWIN You cannot come. How can you possibly come in your condition. \nEMMA It is not so far. \nDARWIN It is two days by coach and train. Who will look after the others. \nEMMA I do not care for the others. I care for Annie! \nEtty, coming apon then unexpectedly, hears this and is instantly heartbroken. \nEMMA is devastated by the slip but is presently too overwrought to retract it. \nDARWIN Leave us please, Etty. \nParslow has gathered up Annie from her room and is carrying her downstairs, pale and sickly-looking, with Brodie fussing behind. \nBRODIE Make sure she is tucked in. Watch her shawl \nANNIE I don't need to go. \nAt the bottom of the stairs, Darwin takes Annie from Parslow's arms \nDARWIN The coach is outside. I will carry her from here. \nEMMA Annie... \nANNIE Mama... \nShe clasps Emma's hand. Darwin keeps heading for the door. Emma holds fast to Annies hand and follows behind \nDARWIN You will see Mamma when you are better. Say goodbye now. \nParslow holds the door open. The coach is at the Gate. Emma stops on the threshold, unable to let go her daughters hand and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake here. \nEMMA Wait. I am coming with you \nDARWIN Please, Emma \nEMMA Wait there. \nShe hurries back inside. Darwin makes a decision and heads for the coach. \n105   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY                                           105 \nDown the patch and through the open gate with the servants following. \nDARWIN Get aboard. Brodie \nANNIE (shouts back) Mama! \nThe garden gate clangs shut behind them. \n106   INT. DOWN HOUSE STAIRWELL/ UPPER HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY        106 \nEmma looks out of the upstairs window, realizes they plan to leave without her and hurries downstairs again. \n107   INT. COACH. THE PAST. DAY                                      107 \nCharles bundles Annie inside. \nDARWIN (to the coachman) Go. Go. \n", "test3_true": "DARWIN Go now! \nANNIE Mama!! \nThe coach sets off. Emma runs to the gate calling desperately. \nEMMA Charles. Please God. No. Annie! \n108   INT. COACH. THE PRESENT                                       108 \nCharles, feeble and debilitated, levers himself into the coach with Parslow assisting and slumps back in the leather upholstery. \nServants gather at the gate. Some of them tearful, not expecting him to return \n109   EXT. STEAM TRAIN. THE PRESENT. DAY.                           109 \nA steam train comes charging past trailing plumes of black smoke, striking sparks from the track with its wheels. \n110   INT. CARRIAGE. THE PRESENT. DAY.                              110 \nThe sickly Darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous, with Parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his lap. \nEvery jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through Darwin's guts. \nThe people sitting opposite - a woman, a child, and a man - regard Darwin in silence. Whatever he suffers from its not good and they are worried about getting infected with it \nThey plunge into a tunnel. The carriage fills with smoke. Parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it won't budge. A burning ember flies inside and lands on Darwin's leg. \nDarwin is too weak to lift a finger. Parslow slaps the ember and extinguishes it. \n111   EXT. STATION. MALVERN.                                        111 \nThe train wheezes to a halt. The doors open and the train disgorges its cargo of sick people, come to Malvern for treatment - a coughing child, a woman with one side of her face aflame with shingles - the halt the lame and the afflicted. \n112   EXT. HORSE AND CART. DAY                                      112 \nDarwin sits in the back as the attendant drives them through Malvern. \nDARWIN Tell him not this way. \nPARSLOW (loudly) Hello there. Stop. Can we go by the other route \nATTENDANT The Worcester Road is shorter. \nDARWIN ...by the low road. \nPARSLOW He wishes to go by the other route. \nATTENDANT (with a sigh) As you will sir. \nHe backs up the horses and turns the cart around \n113   INT. GULLY'S CLINIC. DAY                                      113 \nDr Gully is the chief physician at Malvern spa. His marble- tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling pipes and dripping water. \nDarwin reclines on a leather couch, watching the watery play of light on the ceiling. \nA door opens and Dr Gully comes in, accompanied by two assistants. \nGully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt and tie. His trousers are tucked into calf-length Wellington boots. \nHe greets Darwin cheerfully, effusively. \nMR GULLY Mr Darwin, old friend. Mr Darwin. It has been too long I fear. Tut tut tut tut tut. What have we now what have we now? \nHe clasps Darwin's hand, feeling his pulse at the wrist, then commands him to open his mouth \nGULLY tongue... \nDarwin shows him. \nMR GULLY Ugh. Shirt up. Let me feel your liver. \n"}

Cindy starts to eat a spread of Indian food and booze. 
DEAN How is it? 
CINDY Good. How did Frankie sound? 
DEAN Great. She's the best. 
CINDY She didn't sound sad? 
DEAN Naw. She's the champ. She's the best parts of you and the best parts of me put together. Everyday she gets more and more amazing. 
Dean chews a bite of meat and washes it down with a shot of vodka. He refills both their glasses. 
CINDY Daddy's little girl. 
DEAN She's not mine. I'm hers.

Cindy slows down. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I'm her father. She isn't there for me... I'm there for her. That's the way I look at it. 
CINDY That's beautiful. 
DEAN It's the choice I made when she was born. 
Silence. They chew. Cindy stares through Dean. 
CINDY Why don't you do something... 
DEAN Like what? 
CINDY I don't know... isn't there anything you want to do? 
Dean thinks about it. Shakes his head. 
DEAN What am I supposed to want to do? 
CINDY I don't know... You have so many things you could do. You're good at everything. You could do anything you wanted. 
DEAN I just wanna be with you. 
Silence. Cindy tries not to look disappointed. 
DEAN (CONT'D) You look like an animal right now. Your eyes look like an animal. Like a bear's eyes. 
CINDY Like right before the bear eats the man? 
DEAN Yeah... You do. It's true. That's what you look like. 
Dean is amused but fearful. Cindy's confidence surges.

DEAN (CONT'D) Whatchu thinking about? 
CINDY How different we are. You and me. 
DEAN Different? 
CINDY It's a good thing. 
DEAN You think that's good that we're different? 
CINDY Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way. 
DEAN And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you. 
CINDY I didn't say that. What I meant is that it's important for us to have our space. That's all. We're grown people. 
DEAN Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?

NICK To fuck with our heads? To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could blow them up? 
DUNNIGAN                      * It would be a Clyde move. But it's          * not proof. (to Cantrell)                        * Could he have planted this stuff in         * your house before he was arrested? 
CANTRELL I--I don't know... 
NICK Jonas, think -- last few days, have         * you used any ice? Any salt? 
CANTRELL (confused, grappling) I don't use salt--my cholesterol. Ice? Yeah--not long ago. 
NICK Before or after he was arrested? 
CANTRELL I don't remember! You track your            * use of ice, Nick? You keep a daily          * log? 
TECH #2 calls from the kitchen: 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          88. 
TECH #2 Heads-up! Looks like polonium here. In his tea pot. Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko. Took him two weeks to die. (off their looks) It's an exotic isotope. All you need is a trace amount. Rips through your organs and bone marrow. 
Nick's been listening, thunderstruck, paler by the moment. He looks to Cantrell sitting there, quiet and shaking. 
NICK                                     * I'll buy you a new toothbrush.                         * 
137   EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING OF HOTEL - DAY                           137 
DRIFTING IN on a reflective glass skyscraper -- spectacular. 
138   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY                                             138 
The door opens, revealing Nick, Cantrell, et al. They come into the room...actually, "room" undersells it. It's the most spectacular suite known to man -- huge open floor plan, with a stunning view of all the downtown buildings surrounding us. 
NICK Holy shit. 
CANTRELL Nice? 
DAVIES I'm actually a little jealous Clyde didn't pick me. 
Cantrell laughs -- and it lightens everybody's mood. Nick          * drifts to the windows, gazing out, as:                             * 
DUNNIGAN It's the presidential suite. Last person who stayed here was actually a president. Of a country. Security here is amazing. 
NICK                                     * It's not bad, Jonas. I think you can muddle through. 
DAVIES You're muddling with him. I don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it. You need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs. 
Nick nods, pulls Sarah's reports from his briefcase. 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       89. 
NICK The background check my office was compiling -- these properties we                    * think Clyde owns? If he is working                  * with somebody, they could be                        * operating out of any of these. We                   * should check them.                                  * 
DUNNIGAN I'll try to wrangle additional                      * manpower. Big job.                                  * 
DAVIES (pages the report)                           * No shit. This is quite a list. Over                 * forty locations? 
NICK It's not even complete. Sarah was                   * in the middle of it -- untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies. She's the expert on all that. 
CANTRELL                              * Fellas... I'm grateful for all your efforts. I just wanted to say it. 
NICK Save it for tonight. Hope you're in the mood for Chinese takeout. 
CANTRELL Where are you going? 
NICK That stuff in your house -- it's all gone too far. I started this. I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it. 
139   EXT. COUNTY JAIL ANNEX - DAY                                    139 
A STEEL DOOR opens. Clyde steps out, shackled, blinking at daylight. He comes down a short flight of steps... 
CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal his surroundings: not within prison walls, but rather behind the prison -- a loading area we haven't seen, comprised of fences and razor wire. 
Nick walks in the rear gate, passed through by Warden Iger himself -- this is clearly an off-the-books meeting. Nick and Clyde walk to each other, meet halfway. 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           90. 
CLYDE Interesting location you've chosen. 
NICK I thought we'd have some privacy. 
CLYDE For what? A talk? Or... (gazes around) Maybe you've decided to take Detective Dunnigan's advice. 
He's noticing GUARDS atop the prison wall and surrounding roofs -- all with sniper rifles. 
NICK Be the perfect place for it. Outside the wall. Look like you were shot trying to escape. 
WIDE ANGLE FROM ABOVE 
Nick and Clyde below. A SCOPE suddenly rises into frame, turning our shot into a SNIPER SCOPE POV, jumping Clyde's face into magnification. He smiles in the crosshairs... 
RESUME NICK AND CLYDE 
CLYDE You have some kind of signal worked out? You scratch your nose and blam, I'm a goner?

ABRAR is down, bleeding. - Justin fires another round into Abrar as ABRAR'S WIFE comes flying in from the sleeping quarters and shields him with her body. - Justin shoots her. She falls...Abrar is underneath her - he is still breathing, gasping and - Justin shoots him again, silencing him - Then looks to his wife and assesses her condition - Badly wounded, faint breathing, life fading from her eyes... - Justin turns away 
INT. MAIN HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Justin and a BREACHER proceed down the hall to the heavy gate that blocks access to the stairway while another SEAL stays behind. Somewhere, children are screaming. 
JUSTIN Shut those fucking kids up. O.S. the kids quiet down. 
JUSTIN (CONT'D) Talk to me. 
BREACHER There's no fucking way we want to blow this thing. The gate is solid. 
MIKE (O.S.) 
(OVER RADIO) This is Echo 11 - we're at our primary set point, prepping to breach. 
JUSTIN 
(INTO RADIO) Wait, Echo 11 - we're internal on the south side - this is a negative breach. 
MIKE 
(OVER RADIO) Roger. We're ready to make our entry out here. 
JUSTIN 
(INTO RADIO) Roger that, we're coming to meet you. (to the Breacher) Stay with these kids. Don't let them in the back room. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER 
In the regrouping that occurs on the side of the main house, Justin and Patrick find themselves side by side - and the old friends take a moment to reconnect while the rest of the team places charges and prepares for the next phase of the assault. 
PATRICK 
(QUIETLY) You good? 
JUSTIN Yeah. I forgot...were we supposed to crash that helo? Patrick allows himself a smile. 
PATRICK Ibrahim tried to shoot me through the door. I popped him from the outside. 
JUSTIN I fucking smoked Abrar and his wife. 
(SHIFTING TONE) (alt: I think she was 
PREGNANT) 
PATRICK Still alive? 
JUSTIN She's gonna bleed out. 
PATRICK What a fuckin' mess - The door blows - and they keep moving - 
INT. MAIN HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The SEALs reach the staircase, which is sealed off by a separate metal gate than the one inside the hallway. 
SEAL Breacher up. A charge is prepared. Justin, who is now inside one of the side rooms, sees Jared standing close to the door. 
JUSTIN Hey man, move! Jared moves just as - 
EXT. MAIN HOUSE FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
- Boooom! -- The door FLIES like a missile right into where Jared had been standing. 
JARED 
(TO JUSTIN) Thanks. 
JUSTIN Yeah.

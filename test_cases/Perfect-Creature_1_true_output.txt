Augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe from the onyx table at which they sit, then settles back into a fine hardwood chair. The chair's swirling, delicate back creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe. 
AUGUSTUS (continuing) Are you sure you won't join me? 
Silus shakes his head, no. The opium in the pipe crackles. 
SILUS Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps we should inform the authorities. The human beings. 
Augustus places the pipe down, blows a smoke ring as a Chinese woman, dressed in a sarong, brings over two finely cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men, then leaves. Silus now lifts the glass and we see what it contains. Blood; dark and red and viscous. Silus takes a sip, then looks over to the bar. 
There is a young woman there, sitting at the bar, being treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed patrons; the young woman laughs, enjoying the attention. Tubes run from the young woman's arms. These tubes carry her blood into a conch shaped glass bowl. We see the Chinese waitress fill another glass from the bowl. 
Silus watches, blood slightly present on his ashen lips. And we see two perfectly pointed fangs hanging in his mouth. 
AUGUSTUS For now the Brothers feel we should deal with this ourselves. 
SILUS If they find out we are covering up these deaths... 
AUGUSTUS Which is why you must find him. Silus. 
Silus now turns to Augustus, still looking unconvinced. 
AUGUSTUS (continuing) For centuries we Brothers have served mankind and them us. The great union. But remember your history. 300 years ago when our kind were first born into this world they burnt our children as monsters. They had no notion of evolution. In another world we might all have been slaughtered, only to be remembered in myth, monsters to frighten the young or a puzzle for anthropologists. We must refuse to let one aberrant individual destroy the balance between the two races. The old prejudices are still there. Human beings are paranoid creatures by nature. 
SILUS Perhaps they have good reason. 
AUGUSTUS Silus. Simply concern yourself with finding Edgar. Find your Brother so that we can help him. Before he kills again. 
Cut to 
10 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - DAY                        10 
Close up of a NEWSPAPER. On it we see a banner headline. "Influenza Vaccine Shortages lead to Black Market Trade." We pull out to reveal the paper is lying on a foot path. Wind blows the newspaper out of shot and we tilt up to the street. 
The street is wet, glistening. The rain, rain rain rain. The Edwardian and Victorian buildings of the street might seem beautiful, but they are not. They are largely derelict. We see a woman standing in a doorway out of the rain. 
She is wrapped in a black plastic jacket that she pulls about her. A man approaches her. 
JONES Everyone's ready Lilly. 
LILLY About time. 
They both move to one of the tall buildings; a four story, ancient tenement that looks empty, almost derelict. 
They quietly move up the steps of the place and then pause. There is the bleep from a strange looking valve powered Walkie Talkie; hereafter called an RT. 
LILLY (continuing) On three gents. One, two... 
11 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - DAY                11 
CRASH CUT to the door of the building swinging open wildly, a hand held camera on the shoulder of Lilly and Jones. 
A large, grubby looking woman stands in a long, grim hallway, mop in hand. At the far end of the hall another door disconnects from its hinges and collapses inwards, two men appearing out of the rain. 
JONES (to the woman) Don't you move! 
We see a gun in Jones' hand as he moves towards the woman, who has her hands up and is getting down on her knees. 
The camera then pans wildly, left and right. Then Lilly's foot kicks in a door to our right, revealing a dank office and a man, half naked, reaching for a gun. A woman is lying on a cot and she's screaming. She is instantly recognizable as a prostitute. 
LILLY (to the slum landlord) Don't you dare. 
From this POV we see Lilly's hand pointing a gun at the SLUM LANDLORD, who is now slowly easing back into the scummy office. 
LILLY (continuing) Jones! 
We now finally cut to see Lilly. She is around 25; an intelligent, handsome 25. The man Jones appears at her shoulder, leering. Jones is the type of guy you just know will go to seed at 40. But that's still 10 years away. Jones stares at the Slum Landlord who is trying to cover himself. 
JONES God help us. What an appalling sight.

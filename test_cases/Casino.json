{"train": "Casino - Draft \nCASINO \nBy \nNicholas Pileggi \nEXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY \nSAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn on the ignition. \nACE (V.O.) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.  Otherwise, what's the point? And, for a while... I believed that's the kind of love I had. \nSuddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and their signs. \nMusic in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'. \nAce's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation. \nMAIN TITLE SEQUENCE. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nVignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette. \nACE (V.O.) Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... \nINT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT \nVignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the gods of Olympus. \nACE (V.O.) ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. \nNICKY (V.O.) Matter of fact... \nINT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT \nVignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...nobody knew all the details, but it should'a been perfect. I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nVignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old blonde seated by a small fiery pool. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.  But in the end... \nINT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nACE looks over the casino he rules. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...we fucked it all up. It should'a been so sweet, too.  But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again. \nEXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT \nAerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert night. \nACE (V.O.) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars. But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas... \nEXT. DESERT - DAWN \nAerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance. \nACE (V.O.) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. \nNICKY (V.O.) Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night. \nEXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT \nTITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER' \nACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino. \nACE (V.O.) Who could resist? Anywhere else in the country, I was a bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nWe see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables. \nACE (V.O.) I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work. \nSHERBERT (Introducing the EXECS to ACE) ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room... \nACE (V.O.) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit... \nINT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT \nDolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, who then places the rolls on a rack. \nACE (V.O.) ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your money. That's the truth about Las Vegas. \nINT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY \nCamera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep Out'. \nACE (V.O.) We're the only winners. The players don't stand a chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room. \nHe opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S point of view. \nIt looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money.) \nACE (V.O.) Now this place was off limits. \nCOUNTER #1 Verify two thousand. \nACE (V.O.) Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure. \nNICKY (V.O.) They had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills. And the best part was that upstairs, the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on. \nAt one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and announces: \nCOUNTER #2 Five thousand. \nNICKY (V.O.) I mean, to them everything looked on the up and up. Right? Wrong. \nThe first counter recounts the cash. \nCOUNTER #1 Verify five thousand. \nNICKY (V.O.) The guys inside the counting room... \nStacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list. \nCOUNT ROOM EXEC Five thousand. \nWe move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other directions. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.  They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes. And it was up to this guy right here [NANCE], standin' in front of about two million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or anybody. \nCOUNTER #1 Verify two hundred. \nNANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters dumps another container of money on the table. \nNICKY (V.O.) Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything. Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. Now, look at these guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, right?  They're countin' money. Who wants to bother them? I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're in and you're out. \nNANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door. \nNICKY Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door.  I mean, it's routine. Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. And that's all there is to it. Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City ...which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested. \nNANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb. \nEXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY \nNANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired sixty-year-old underboss. \nTITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY' \nNICKY (V.O.) That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted ...and they wanted it every month. \nPISCANO Hey, John, how are you? How was your ride? \nEXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY \nNANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter the produce market. \nNICKY (V.O.) Now this old Mormon fuck here... \nCUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR \nINT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY \nNANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled with red wine. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy. \nNANCE Somethin' smells good. \nPISCANO Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat. \nNICKY (V.O.) The bosses would come from all over the place: Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee. All over the Midwest. And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City. I mean, nobody even knew. \nNANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty- year-old yuppie lawyer son. \nCamera continues to pan around the room. \nNICKY (V.O.) One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking. \nOn VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss. \nBORELLI Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano? \nOn VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man. \nFORLANO Jerry Steriano? \nBORELLI Yeah. \nNICKY (V.O.) Now, these old greaseballs might not look it, but believe me, these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas. \nPISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove. \nPISCANO'S MOTHER That man's here again. \nPiscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce. \nINT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a fit bemoaning his bad luck. \nNICKY (V.O.) But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost. \nGAGGI (Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands) Ma che cazzo! \n[Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' sweeps. \nNICKY (V.O.) I mean, unless Ace made his bet. \nGAGGI That's enough now! \nOLD MAN CAPO I can't contest the cards. \nGAGGI Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning a young man.) Johnny! \nNICKY (V.O.) Ace made more money for them on a weekend than I could do heisting joints for a month. \nACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table. \nNICKY (V.O.) Whatever Ace picked up on the street he told Remo. \nNICKY (Walks over to ACE and whispers) Hey, did you bring that thing? \nNICKY (V.O.) You know, I mean fixed fights, doped horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... locked-in point spreads. He told fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell you the truth. I don't blame him. \nGAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand. \nGAGGI Ace. \nNICKY (V.O.) Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world. \nGAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave. \nGAGGI Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it? \nACE Well, that's why they paid so well. \nGAGGI You see? (Chuckles.) Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week? \nACE Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? \nGAGGI Okay. You come by the house? \nACE I'll come by. \nGAGGI Seven o'clock? \nACE Seven o'clock. \nGAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look on. \nGAGGI Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace? \nACE nods in agreement and leaves the room. \nGAGGI (To NICKY) Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] \nNICKY (To ACE) I'll be right out. \nGAGGI T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? (pointing to the off- screen ACE) \nNICKY Mm. \nGAGGI Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him. \nNICKY Mm. \nGAGGI Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay? \nNICKY All right. \nGAGGI Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] \nNICKY Yeah. \nGAGGI Fine. \nNICKY (Reaching down to touch GAGGI's money, joking with him.) Want me to take this for you? (He walks out.) \nNICKY (V.O.) So, now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure that nobody fucks around with the Golden Jew. \nINT. BACK HOME BAR - NIGHT \nWe move past JOE, a guy at the bar entertaining a BRUNETTE and a BLONDE, to NICKY and FRANK MARINO at the other end. There are other bar patrons in the background. \nJOE (To the BARTENDER) Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies. \nBARTENDER (O.S.) All right. \nACE (V.O.) Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. \nNICKY (To MARINO) They payin'? \nACE (V.O.) How did Nicky collect? \nMARINO They pay every week, like they're supposed to. \nACE (V.O.) Don't ask. \nNICKY Then where the fuck is the money? I don't see the money. \nACE enters, and greets the two girls. \nACE Hi, Melissa. Heidi. \nBLONDE Hi, Sam. \nJOE (To the GIRLS) Who's this guy? \nMARINO (To NICKY) Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine. \nACE approaches NICKY and MARINO. \nNICKY It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game. \nACE Eight. \nNICKY If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight. \nMARINO Well, how come I laid nine? \nNICKY 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten... \nACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the shoulder. \nACE (To JOE) Excuse me. \nJOE What? \nACE (He holds up the pen) Is this yours? Your pen? \nJOE Yeah, that's my pen. Why? \nACE I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost. \nJOE Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off? \nNICKY looks over. \nACE Well, I was just offering you the- \nNICKY moves towards JOE. \nJOE (Turning his back to talk to the girls, referring to ACE) This fuckin' asshole. \nNICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand. \nMAN #1 (To JOE) Look out! \nBefore ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing him in the neck with the pen. \nMAN #1 Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out! \nNICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's throat. JOE tumbles to the floor. \nNICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE whimpers. \nNICKY What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?! \nACE (Over whimpers and pants) Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. \nACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen. \nACE (V.O.) While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. \nNICKY (V.O.) Listen... \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT \nCamera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot- machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and over to a craps table. \nMontage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...with me protecting Ace, he made a fortune for the bosses. I mean that's what got him to Vegas. He was a money machine. A tremendous earner for these guys.  As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop. With Ace the casino never saw so much money. And the bosses, they couldn't be happier. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nCamera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off winners. Chips and money are everywhere. \nIn extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO SLOT-MACHINE AREA - NIGHT \nACE and SHERBERT are walking down a casino aisle by the slot- machines. Dealers immediately snap to attention at their approach. \nACE (V.O.) In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced- in local cowboys working. They were close to the, you know, good old boys. \nACE (To SHERBERT) Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart. \nACE (V.O.) I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit. \nACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly. \nDEALER (Humming, fielding, every roll.) \nCAMERA PANS TO A FLOOR MAN, STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND THE BOX MAN. \nACE (V.O.) The floor men are watching the box men. \nCAMERA SWISH PANS TO REVEAL A PIT BOSS STEPPING IN, SCANNING THE FLOOR. \nACE (V.O.) The pit bosses are watching the floor men. \nSWISH PAN TO A SHIFT BOSS SURVEYING THE CASINO. \nACE (V.O.) The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. \nSWISH PAN TO SHERBERT. \nACE (V.O.) The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. \nSWISH PAN TO ACE. \nACE (V.O.) I'm watching the casino manager. \nCAMERA SWISH PANS AND TILTS UP TO A VIDEO CAMERA MOUNTED INSIDE A GLASS DOME HANGING FROM THE CEILING. \nACE (V.O.) And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all. \nSWISH PAN TO: \nINT. TANGIERS-EYE-IN-THE SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT \nVideo monitors show a dealer fanning a row of bills. Swish pan to ACE and SHERBERT watching the monitor. ACE lights a cigarette. \nACE (V.O.) Plus... \nSWISH PAN TO SURVEILLANCE CATWALKERS ADJUSTING CAMERAS AND SPYING ON PLAYERS BELOW WITH BINOCULARS. \nACE (V.O.) ...we had a dozen guys up there, most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house. \nINT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT \nGinger squeals as she throws the dice across the table. \nHIGH ROLLER Come on, come on. \nShe rolls a winner. \nGINGER Yes! \nHIGH ROLLER Thank you. Very nice. \nGINGER (Chuckles) I told you I was hot tonight. \nINT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT \nSound out: The monitor shows GINGER and the HIGH ROLLER cheering, she throws her arms around him. The crowd goes crazy. \nSWISH PAN TO ACE LOOKING ON INTENTLY. \nOn screen, GINGER's hand sneaks a chip from the rack and subtly moves it towards her purse. \nINT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT \nSound in: GINGER slips the chip quietly into her bag. \nHIGH ROLLER (Off-screen) Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come on. This is for Ginger. \nThe HIGH ROLLER notices GINGER's hand on her purse. She pretends to have taken out her lipstick. \nGAMBLER #1 Let me have a hundred on the hard ten. Thank you. \nGAMBLER #2 Hard ten. One hundred. \nINT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT \nACE continues to look at the monitor. SHERBERT and a security man seated at a video console also look on. \nINT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT \nA craps stick pushes some dice towards GINGER. She rolls again, only this time she craps out. Gamblers groan, then applaud her. She's made so much money for the table that the winners toss chips in her direction. \nHIGH ROLLER I'm sorry. \nGINGER Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (To the table) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. \nACE and two casino execs are now on the floor watching her. \nGINGER Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast. \nHIGH ROLLER Ginger, honey. \nDEALER Thank you very much, now. \nHIGH ROLLER Ginger, honey, this is for you love. Thanks for your time. \nShe turns to the HIGH ROLLER, who is handing her a thin stack of chips worth about $2,000. \nGINGER (Chuckles) Come on. \nHIGH ROLLER What's the matter? \nGINGER What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut. \nHIGH ROLLER What money? I've seen you stealing from me. \nGINGER What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end. \nHIGH ROLLER Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me. \nGINGER Don't give me that shit. I want my money. \nHIGH ROLLER That bag's full of fuckin' chips you \nGINGER (Interrupts) What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you. \nACE watches the argument heat up. \nHIGH ROLLER Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! \nGINGER Get lost? \nHIGH ROLLER Yes. \nGINGER Get lost? \nHIGH ROLLER Yes. \nGINGER knocks the chip rack out of his hands. \nGINGER Well, how 'bout that? \nHIGH ROLLER Come on! (He bends down to pick them up.) \nGamblers and dealers shout and yell. She picks up another rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, and another. Chips fly all over the casino. Everyone starts diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards. Waitresses. Pit bosses. Bedlam. \nACE and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving for chips. He looks at GINGER. She looks at him. \nFREEZE FRAME ON GINGER. \nSlow motion: GINGER smiles at ACE and walks off. \nACE (V.O.) What a move. I fell in love right there. \nINT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nGINGER and ACE are seated on a banquette. Close up of his hand attaching a diamond and ruby pin to her dress. Tilt up to GINGER's smiling face beaming at ACE. \nACE (V.O.) But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money. \nThey kiss. \nGINGER I'm going to go powder my nose. (ACE hands GINGER a single $50 bill. She smiles coyly. He hands her another fifty.) \nACE (V.O.) Ginger's mission in life was money. \nGINGER I'll be right back. \nACE (O.S.) (from following scene) See you, Ginger. \nFLASHBACK - EXT. CASINO ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nGINGER waves goodbye to the DOORMAN and walks towards two VALET PARKERS who greet her warmly. She gets a bottle of pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in return. \nGINGER Okay, thank you for asking. \nACE (V.O.) She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. \nGINGER (To VALET PARKERS) Hello. \nVALET PARKER Hey, Ginger, how you doin'? \nGINGER Great. (Handing the VALET some money.) And I have something for you. You got me covered? \nThe VALET PARKER places a vial of pills in her hand. \nVALET PARKER Yes. Something for you, there. \nGINGER And you do. Thank you very much. \nVALET PARKER Take care of yourself. \nFLASHBACK - INT. HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT \nGINGER hands the pills to HIGH ROLLER #2 in his hotel bathroom, where he is washing his face and trying to energize himself. \nGINGER I got some lucky pills for you, honey. \nHIGH ROLLER #2 Oh, yeah? \nACE (V.O.) Who didn't want Ginger? She was one of the best-known, best-liked and most respected hustlers in town. Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake for two or three days before sending him home broke to the little woman and his bank examiners. \nINT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nGINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE. \nACE Any change? \nMob bosses FORLANO, CAPELLI, GAGGI, BORELLI and PISCANO seated around the back room table eating and talking as in the opening vignette. \nNICKY (V.O.) They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace and... \nINT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE, LAS VEGAS - DAY \nACE opens the door to NICKY and JENNIFER. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim. \nACE (Opening door) Hey. \nJENNIFER Hey, how you doin'? (Kisses ACE.) \nNICKY Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you? \nJENNIFER and NICKY take in ACE's spectacular Vegas-style penthouse. \nJENNIFER (Whispering) Wow. \nNICKY Boy, look at this place, huh? \nJENNIFER Incredible. \nNICKY All right. \nACE Welcome to Vegas. \nCAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE LAS VEGAS SKYLINE. \nNICKY Okay, Sammy. \nACE Somethin', huh? \nNICKY Yeah. \nACE (Calling her over) Ginger. \nGINGER emerges from the bedroom. NICKY and JENNIFER are both stunned by her beauty. \nNICKY (To ACE) Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here? \nACE Honey, come here. \nShe walks to them \nACE This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. \nJENNIFER (Shaking hands) Good to meet you. \nGINGER Hi, Jennifer. \nNICKY Pleasure. (Grasping GINGER's hand and kissing it.) Very nice to meet you. \nGINGER Hi, how are you? \nNICKY Okay, Sammy. \nINT. ACE'S CAR, LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT \nACE and NICKY are driving through town, the neon lights of Vegas reflected in the windshield. \nACE (V.O.) After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. \nNICKY What do you think about me movin' out here? (ACE looks away.) What's the matter? You got a problem with that? \nACE No, of course not. \nNICKY (Playfully) You mean, I have your permission? \nACE Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. \nNICKY I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. (Referring to the Vegas lights.) Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home. \nACE Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. \nNICKY Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything. \nACE gives NICKY a look. \nEXT./INT. LAS VEGAS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT \nNICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out. \nNICKY (V.O.) Ace saw Vegas one way. \nNICKY You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'? \nMARINO Of course. \nThey walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter. \nNICKY (V.O.) But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose. \nACE (V.O.) Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? (Chuckles.) Nicky was the muscle. \nNICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck. \nNICKY Tony. \nTONY Hey. \nNICKY How you doin'? \nTONY How you doin'? \nNICKY All right, yeah. You got that thing for me? \nTONY What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'. \nNICKY I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it. \nTONY You sure? \nNICKY I'm positive. \nTONY Well, I'm a little confused here. \nNICKY You're a little confused? \nTONY Yeah. \nNICKY (Pointing to a window, above a counter with a tiny opening to talk through) Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money! \nTONY takes some money out of his coat pocket. \nTONY (Groaning) I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it. \nNICKY Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?! \nHe smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money. \nTONY (Gasps) My fuckin' head. \nNICKY Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony. \nMARINO (Pointing to TONY) Smarten up. \nNICKY (Walking out) You jag-off. \nCLASSROOM NUN (O.S.) (From following scene) And now... \nINT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nNICKY and JENNIFER stand in the background with other parents listening to a NUN school teacher. LITTLE NICKY and other youngsters are seated at small children's desks. \nCLASSROOM NUN ...Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president. \nLITTLE NICKY (Stepping up in front of the class to begin a speech) George Washington was born in a... \nACE (V.O.) But still, it was nice and quiet for a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town, like regular Ozzie and Harriets. \nLITTLE NICKY ...typical Virginia farmhouse. \nEXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY \nNICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons. JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging words sends him running on to the field. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON (To LITTLE NICKY) Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing. \nNICKY (V.O.) Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game. \nNICKY (V.O.) Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'... \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. \nNICKY Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born. \nDETECTIVE JOHNSON It's instinctive, you know. \nNICKY He tries to do everything... \nLITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON applaud. \nNICKY Ohh! \nACE (V.O.) And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known. \nINT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE CREDIT WINDOW - NIGHT \nNICKY saunters through the casino and up to EDDY and JERRY, two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's credit window near ACE and SHERBERT. \nACE (V.O.) Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message. \nNICKY (V.O.) Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand? (Chuckling.) Yeah, right, I'm sure. \nJERRY (Shakes NICKY's hand) Hey, Nicky. How are you? \nNICKY Hey, Eddy. \nSIGNALER Well, I... I never tried. \nACE So, you're a righty? \nSIGNALER Ye-yeah. \nACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of screams. ACE watches. \nACE Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. \nSIGNALER God! (He moans and sits back.) \nWINNER (O.S.) (From following scene) It's a hundred... \nINT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT \nThe WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT walks up behind him. \nWINNER ...a hundred ten. \nCASHIER Yes, it is. \nWINNER I think. \nCASHIER Yes. \nWINNER Okay. \nSHERBERT Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public. \nWINNER Yeah. \nSHERBERT (To CASHIER) Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh? \nCASHIER Yes. \nSHERBERT A little privacy. And, by the way, send over a... nice bottle of champagne on ice, huh? \nCASHIER Sure will. \nSHERBERT Real special.  Somethin'... (To WINNER.) By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, your casino manager. \nHe shakes hands with the WINNER. \nWINNER Hi. \nSHERBERT Having a good time? \nSHERBERT leads him away from the cage. \nWINNER Yes, uh... \nSHERBERT You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... \nWINNER Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings? \nINT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT \nThe WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his broken hand. \nSIGNALER Look what they did to my hand, man! \nACE (Walks over to the WINNER) All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? \nSHERBERT stands next to the WINNER \nWINNER I just wanna get out of here. \nACE And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand? \nWINNER I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. \nACE You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? \nWINNER Yeah. \nACE Get out of here. \nWINNER Thank you. \nThe GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room. \nACE (To the GUARDS, referring to the SIGNALER) Throw him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car. \nINT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE \nACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip. \nACE (V.O.) Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. \nACE We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? \nGINGER What, are you trying to handicap me? \nACE I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? (GINGER looks doubtful.) I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. \nGINGER (Sighs, laughing) You got the wrong girl, Sam. \nACE I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. \nGINGER You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know? \nACE I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. \nGINGER You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't. \nACE Yeah, I know all that. \nGINGER I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. \nACE (Brushing cigarette ash off his dressing gown) I - I - I... \nGINGER Understand? (Pause) I'm sorry. \nACE No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. \nGINGER If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me? \nACE You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. \nGINGER (Interrupts) What're you... what're you pitching me, here? \nACE Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. (Pause) Want to take a chance? \nShe looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly. \nINT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT \nACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child is in a cradle. NICKY and JENNIFER are hovering around the baby with LITTLE NICKY and are blissfully happy. It is an elegant affair.  City Officials, politicians and gaming officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests. \nACE (V.O.) When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' \nNICKY (V.O.) It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her - \nWe see AMY in the cradle. \nNICKY (V.O.) - he still covered his bets. They had to have the baby first, before they got married. Even made Jennie and me watch Amy for a few days when they went on their honeymoon. But I didn't mind, we loved the kid. \nIN SLOW MOTION CAMERA MOVES IN ON ACE AND GINGER, STANDING NEXT TO A LARGE WEDDING CAKE. THEY ARE KISSING. NICKY, SHERBERT AND OTHER GUESTS LOOK ON. \nCAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS THEY KISS, THEN PAST THEM TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM FIGURINES ON THE CAKE. \nLESTER's and GINGER's telephone conversation is heard in voice-over this scene. \nLESTER (Over telephone) Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you feel me look into your heart?  Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach? Can you feel me in you? In your heart? \nWe see a wide view of the elaborate wedding, guests mill about the banquet hall. \nLESTER Don't make me come there. Answer me. \nGINGER (Over telephone, sobbing) I love you. \nINT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLESTER DIAMOND is talking on the phone softly, cutting up cocaine on a piece of glass. \nLESTER (Into telephone) Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too? \nGINGER (Over telephone) No, Lester. \nLESTER (Into telephone) Do you know that? \nGINGER (Over telephone) Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now. \nLESTER (Into telephone) That's right. \nINT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nGINGER is sitting alone on the phone. She's crying. \nLESTER (Over telephone) So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it? \nGINGER (Sobbing, into telephone) Promise? \nLESTER (Over telephone) God... I wish you... \nINT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThere is a beautiful scantily dressed blonde girl in the apartment with him. She bends down to the table in front of him, snorts some cocaine, then walks away. \nLESTER (Into telephone) ...all the luck in the world. \nGINGER (Over telephone) You do? \nLESTER (Into telephone) Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas. \nINT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nACE enters from the ballroom and sees GINGER on the phone. He walks towards her, listening to her conversation. \nLESTER (Over telephone) Come on, this is great for us. You know I'm gonna be here for you. I ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute. I'm seein' you, and I can feel my heart click. I see you fourteen years old. I see you the first second I ever saw you. I see you, long-legged little colt - \nGINGER notices ACE behind her. \nLESTER - with stupid braces on your teeth. \nMIKE gets up from the table. \nNICKY (V.O.) They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks. In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket. Then... \nINT. TANGIERS POKER TABLE - NIGHT \nNICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, MOOSH and COWBOY, all secretly signaling each other, sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the crooked dealer from the previous scene, deals NICKY a winning hand. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players. \nACE (V.O.) It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy. \nMOOSH (Scratching his arm) I'm gonna open for five hundred. \nROCKY Moosh, you open? (Taps his fingers on some chips before picking them up.) \nACE (V.O.) Signaling back and forth. \nCARD SHARK I bet thirty-five hundred. \nNICKY wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth. \nDOCTOR DAN I've been losing for three days straight, non-stop. \nAnother shark pulls on his ear. \nROCKY Oh, why're you crying, with three loaves of bread under your arm? \nACE watches their signals with concern. \nACE (V.O.) Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong. \nWe see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, sneaking looks at NICKY's table. \nACE (V.O.) And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. \nNICKY Four aces, Doc. \nHis hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces. \nNICKY What do you got? \nDOCTOR DAN (Getting up in disgust) Jesus Christ. I can't believe it. \nCOWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large pot toward his side of the table. \nDOCTOR DAN If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. I'm out of here, you understand? \nACE (V.O.) I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost. \nHe walks towards NICKY's table. \nACE (V.O.) What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war? \nACE leans down to talk to NICKY. \nACE (V.O.) I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. \nACE (Whispering in NICKY's ear) Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. \nNICKY So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? \nACE You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. \nACE walks away. NICKY looks over at the gaming agents. \nNICKY (V.O.) Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino, he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nSecurity people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are fighting. Camera picks up ACE as he passes by them. \nNICKY (V.O.) A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas! We're supposed to be out here robbin', you dumb fuckin' Heeb.' \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO POKER TABLE - NIGHT \nCloseup of the COWBOY's white-socked feet with no shoes on a poker table. \nACE (To SHERBERT, referring to COWBOY) I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint? \nSHERBERT approaches COWBOY. \nSHERBERT Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes on, please? \nCOWBOY (Sighs) Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad night. \nCOWBOY remains the same with his feet on the table. \nSHERBERT (Returning to ACE) Fuckin' asshole won't budge. \nACE Call security. \nACE approaches COWBOY. \nACE How are you? \nCOWBOY Good. How are you? \nACE Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on? \nCOWBOY Fuck you. \nACE walks to nearby SECURITY GUARDS. \nACE (To GUARDS) I want you to exit this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fuckin' door. \nThree SECURITY GUARDS approach COWBOY. \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside? \nCOWBOY Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 knocks his feet off the table, as GUARDS #2 and #3 lift him off his seat. \nCOWBOY Fuck you! Fuck you! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Yeah? \nCOWBOY You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Now move along. \nCOWBOY (Screaming at ACE who follows him) You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with? \nThe GUARDS carry him out and forcefully shove him towards a side exit. \nCOWBOY Leave me alone! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Here we go! \nCOWBOY (Grunting) You've gotta be kidding me! (Groans.) \nThe GUARDS lift him off his feet and, holding him like a battering ram, smash his head into the door. \nACE (V.O.) (As COWBOY is thrown out the door) Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call. \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nNICKY is on a public wall-phone talking to ACE.

TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE is on a Tangiers house phone. SHERBERT looks on. \nACE (Into telephone) No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? \nNICKY (Over telephone) No. \nINT.

TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE listens to the noise of NICKY roughing up COWBOY. \nNICKY (Over telephone) ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here. \nACE LOOKS AT SHERBERT. \nMARINO (Over telephone) Get up. \nGINGER Thanks. Yes, all right. \nCOUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3 Great. \nACE (V.O.) She made everybody feel good. \nGINGER joins ACE. He smiles proudly. \nINT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT \nGINGER and ACE are off alone by a dining-room table, talking intently. A young casino EXECUTIVE interrupts them. \nEXECUTIVE Congratulations, Sam. \nACE (Shaking his hand) Oh, thanks. \nThe flirting EXECUTIVE looks at GINGER. \nEXECUTIVE Hello, Mrs Rothstein. \nGINGER Hi. \nEXECUTIVE How are you? \nGINGER Oh. \nGINGER gives the flirting EXECUTIVE her hand, he kisses it. \nEXECUTIVE You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man Mr Rothstein. \nACE watches as GINGER flashes one of her dazzling smiles, but he's not sure whether she's flirting. He looks at the young man and back at his wife. \nACE Thank you. Thanks for that compliment. \nACE (V.O.) He was a young kid from the casino... nice kid...  bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid! The next day I fired him. \nFreeze frame on ACE smiling at GINGER. \nINT.

But as much as they loved her... \nGINGER (To AMY, wearing the bracelet) Oh, fabulous. \nACE (V.O.) ...they didn't know what really moved her. \nShe holds up a necklace to the light. \nGINGER Look at this. Look at this. \nCAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM THE DOOR LEADING TO THE VIEWING ROOM REVEALING A BANK MANAGER SEATED AT A DESK. WE HEAR GINGER AND AMY BEHIND THE DOOR. \nGINGER (O.S.) (From the viewing room) Daddy gave me this pin when we were dating. \nACE (V.O.) And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO, SLOT-MACHINES - NIGHT \nACE is talking to DON WARD. \nWARD Loose machines are right back over there. \nACE What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. \nWARD Okay, I'll - \nACE What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. \nWARD Well... \nACE These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. \nWARD Yeah, okay. \nACE The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front. \nWARD All right, I will, I will. \nACE Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand? \nWARD I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you. \nACE Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this. \nWARD Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry. \nINT. CLASSY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nGINGER follows a snooty MAITRE D' to JENNIFER, already seated at a table. \nACE (V.O.) So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen- hour days?  Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas. \nMAITRE D' (To JENNIFER) Come with me, please. I have a better table for you.  Sorry. \nHe shows the two of them to the best table in the place. \nJENNIFER (Sitting down next to GINGER) So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? \nGINGER (Smiling) I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. \nJENNIFER (Chuckles) Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. \nGINGER lights a cigarette. \nEXT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY \nWide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to Vegas'. \nACE (V.O.) Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it. \nNICKY (From inside the diner) What the fuck is that supposed to mean? \nINT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY \nACE and NICKY are seated at a table in the empty diner. \nNICKY (Reading from a document) ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' (He waves the document.) Do you believe this shit? \nACE (Smoking a cigarette) Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. \nNICKY hisses. \nNICKY (Reading) 'Who is of notorious and unsavory reputation...' \nHe angrily wads the document and tosses it across the table. \nNICKY Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this? \nACE Nope, there's no way. \nNICKY Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like? \nACE Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. \nNICKY In other words, I'm fucked. \nACE In so many words, yes. \nACE (V.O.) It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. \nNICKY I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em. \nEXT.

CAMERA COMES TO REST ON EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NICKY'S EYES AS HE STANDS ON THE OUTSIDE PORCH. \nNICKY (V.O.) So, once they pulled that shit, I started doin' my own things in Vegas nobody ever thought of doin'. To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother Dominick... and some desperadoes from back home and started knockin' over high rollers, casino bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right here in town. I had a good fuckin' crew goin' for me, I'll tell you that. \nSAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs, wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks by each man as they're introduced. \nNICKY (V.O.) I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a safe company after he did a six-year bit. And then there was Bernie Blue. This guy could bypass any alarm for me. And I opened up my own jewelry store, too: 'The Gold Rush'. \nINT. BEDROOM OF LUXURY HOME - NIGHT \nNICKY places some jewelry from a vanity table into a sack and turns over some family photos. MARINO and HARDY are struggling with a safe. \nNICKY (V.O.) Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around. \nNICKY (To MARINO and HARDY) What's takin' so long over there? \nMARINO This peter's a motherfucker. \nHARDY (Grunting) It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. It's comin'. \nNICKY Gotta learn how to open these fuckin' things so you won't have to take 'em. \nINT.

Not only should you quit, you should run! \nACE Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? \nSTONE What do you propose? \nACE I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? \nSTONE They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. \nACE All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. \nSTONE I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. \nACE (Sighs) I can't do that. \nACE (V.O.) Of course... \nINT.

Fuckers!  They take it, but they don't want to give it back. \nNICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of the table. \nNICKY How the fuck can you grin? How the fuck could you grin? \nThe FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table. \nNICKY You know how much I'm stuck? You give a fuck? \nThe MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her on the shoulder. \nNICKY Do ya?! \nShe lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in- the-Sky that they are empty, and exits. \nNICKY (To departing FEMALE DEALER) Yeah.

Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick in all night? Huh? You been beatin' all the customers tonight, motherfucker? \nWe see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips and an upturned ten and a two. \nNICKY Huh, jag-off? Hit me. \nThe card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning that NICKY has lost. \nEveryone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.) \nNICKY Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass! Hit me again. \nThe DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns over a card. It's another paint, a queen.

You gotta get out of here! \nNICKY Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker. \nACE Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both. \nNICKY Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy. \nACE I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you. \nTo the PIT BOSS, holding up ten fingers. \nACE Ten and that's it. \nHe makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT standing right behind him. \nNICKY What are you starin' at, you bald- headed Jew prick?! \nBefore SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock. \nNICKY Sue me, you Jew fuck! \nMARINO Let's get out of here. \nNICKY What? Get out of here?

It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do?

Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I - \nGINGER (To ACE) We had a deal. Remember that? (To OSCAR.) He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave. \nACE (To GINGER, leaning closer to her) Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes. \nGINGER turns to him. \nACE You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that makes you think I would ever let someone in your condition take my child away from me? (Pause.)

So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. \nACE (Seated across from GINGER at a booth) First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much. \nGINGER I bought him a watch too. \nACE Yeah. \nGINGER Yeah. \nACE But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand? \nGINGER Yeah. \nACE At the most, which is impossible for him. \nShe glances to the table behind them. \nACE Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece.

What? \nGINGER Nothin'. \nNICKY What were you gonna say? Go ahead. \nGINGER I don't - (Sighs.) \nNICKY Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead. \nGINGER Yeah? \nNICKY Yeah. \nGINGER Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out. \nNICKY (Pauses) Let me think about that. \nGINGER Okay. \nNICKY See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. \nGINGER Mm-hm. \nNICKY You know? \nGINGER Yeah. 'Cause, you know, (leaning her head back) He's never gonna give me my jewelry. \nNICKY Hm. \nGINGER He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass. \nNICKY (Chuckles) Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too. \nTakes a sip of his drink. \nGINGER He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me. \nNICKY No, he wouldn't. I would have. (GINGER chuckles.) And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously. (She cuddles closer to him.) Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off. \nGINGER (Quietly) I didn't. (Chuckles.) I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back. \nNICKY You did. You're right. \nGINGER Exactly. \nNICKY embraces her. \nNICKY You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing. \nGINGER (Playing with his jacket) I did what you told me to. \nNICKY Yes, you did. \nGINGER 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do. \nNICKY Yeah. (Pause, with his arm around her.) Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - (She caresses his face.) - didn't he? \nGINGER Sure did. \nNICKY Everything went to his head. (He sighs, rubbing her neck.) \nNICKY/GINGER (In unison) Changed. \nNICKY He did. He ain't the same person, right? \nGINGER (Whispering) No, he's not. \nNICKY He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that. \nGINGER (Holding back tears) Exactly. (Sighs.) He hates me. \nShe rests her head on NICKY's shoulder, starting to weep. \nGINGER He hates my fuckin' guts. \nNICKY Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. (Runs his hand down her cheek.) Don't cry. \nGINGER (Crying) I'm not as tough as you think I am. \nNICKY Yes, you are. \nGINGER (Sobbing) I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do. \nNICKY (Whispering) Come on. Don't be scared. \nGINGER (Softly, through tears) I need some help. I do. I need some help. (Strokes his chest.) You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky. \nGINGER's sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke NICKY's neck. \nGINGER (Whispering) I do. I need a new sponsor. \nNICKY (Quietly, cheek to cheek) Is that what you want? \nGINGER Yeah. \nNICKY A sponsor. \nGINGER Yeah. \nNICKY Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya. \nGINGER (Whispering) Nicky, please... \nNICKY Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh? \nGINGER (Sobbing) Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. \nNICKY It's what you want? \nGINGER Yeah. Uh-huh - \nNICKY interrupts and kisses her. She kisses him back. He pushes her head down to his lap. \nEXT.

What are you doin' with your cumma? \nPISCANO What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.] \nNICKY (V.O.) The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster. This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee. \nBORELLI Artie, what the hell have you been doin' out there, Artie? \nPISCANO I'm out there more than I'm here. \nNICKY (V.O.) And little did anybody know where this would all lead.

She was doin' pretty good with her lawsuit, but before she could start countin' her money, the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court instead. \nINT. ANNA SCOTT'S HOME, KITCHEN, LAS VEGAS - DAY \nSCOTT, alone, is sitting at her kitchen table. \nNICKY (V.O.) So, they send me. \nNICKY swiftly enters the room, grabs SCOTT around the neck, and fires three shots into her head. \nHe leans SCOTT back against the chair, then gently, while stroking her hair, sets her head to the side.

It was never a partnership. \nReporters chase CHASE as he walks down the ramp and across the tarmac to his white limousine. \nREPORTER #1 Police are calling this a mob-style killing. \nREPORTER #2 Did you ever hear of the twenty-two- caliber killer? \nGREEN I'm a little in shock, quite frankly... \nACE (V.O.)

Let me help you. Come on. We're talkin' about some stuff. \nNEWSCASTER (On television) State officials say 'yes' when that relationship and those connections are with anyone as notorious as Nicky Santoro. \nACE takes GINGER's arm and leads her out of the room toward the stairs. \nNEWSCASTER Tonight at six: 'Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers' Casino boss?'

Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss. \nNICKY Yeah. (Pause.) I think I want my money back. \nCHARLIE CLARK (Chuckling) What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me? \nNICKY You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie?

You can fuckin' try me, fatso. \nA frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs. \nNICKY You fuckin' try me. \nHe turns to ACE who's behind the bar. \nNICKY You think he got the point? \nACE (Walking to NICKY) What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI. \nNICKY Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time. \nACE I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? \nNICKY Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way. \nACE Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? \nNICKY Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. (Pause.) You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it? \nACE No, I don't wanna come - \nNICKY You should say so. \nACE I don't wanna come along with you. \nNICKY Just say so. \nACE I'll be honest with you. \nNICKY All right, fine. \nACE I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... \nNICKY Fine. \nNICKY walks to a table and flips through Business Week magazine. \nACE ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. \nNICKY (Holding up the magazine) You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet? \nACE That's all taken out of context. Okay. \nNICKY Yeah, that's out of context. Okay. \nACE I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. \nNICKY Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. \nACE Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. \nNICKY Yeah? \nACE Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. \nNICKY What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me? \nACE What happened to me? What happened to you? \nNICKY Yeah. \nACE You lost your control. \nNICKY I lost control? \nACE Yes, you lost your control. \nNICKY Look at you.

Even your own wife. \nACE My wife? \nNICKY Yeah. \nACE Now, what does she have to do with all this? \nNICKY Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. \nACE All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? \nNICKY No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. \nACE Listen, I would - \nNICKY (Interrupting) The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. \nACE I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. \nNICKY Hey, she came to talk... \nACE Please... \nNICKY ...to me. \nACE ...don't do it to me... \nNICKY She came to talk to me... \nACE Okay? \nNICKY And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out? \nACE Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. \nNICKY It's none of my business? \nACE That's right, yeah. \nNICKY A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. \nACE Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. \nNICKY starts to walk out. \nACE This guy is gonna run to the FBI. \nNICKY Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal. \nACE (V.O.) I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. \n", "test2_true": "ACE (V.O.) Nicky wanted to take over.

Well, in my line of work, things don't run so smooth, I'm sorry. I mean, I'm dealing with degenerate animals out here. But the bosses, what do they give a fuck? They're sittin' on their asses, drinkin' anisette. Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

But I didn't want to look at 'em. I didn't want to look at the guys who brought 'em either. \nACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the door on the AGENTS. \nINT. FEDERAL COURT-HOUSE - DAY \nGAGGI, FORLANO, BORELLI and CAPELLI are all in court. FORLANO and CAPELLI are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks with nearby doctors and nurses. GAGGI \nhas a cane in front of him. Several court spectators look on. We hear the bosses' lawyer speak. \nLAWYER Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm. Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk. They are no danger to the community and they pose no flight risk. \nNICKY (V.O.) When the bosses were arrested, some of 'em were so old they needed doctors at their arraignment. \nLAWYER And Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set. \nJUDGE (Calling a recess) We're going to take a ten-minute recess. \nThe JUDGE pounds his gavel. \nNICKY (V.O.)

COURT-HOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe BOSSES are gathered around a conference table as the lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue. \nNICKY (V.O.) See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out. It's always better with no witnesses. So, what about Andy? \nTHE CAMERA PANS FROM ONE BOSS TO THE OTHER. \nFORLANO (Putting down his oxygen mask once the door behind him is shut) He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. Stand-up guy, just like his old man. That's the way I see it. \nBORELLI I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine. \nCAPELLI (Holding his oxygen mask) He's okay. He always was.

They walk away discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars. \nNICKY (V.O.) As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us. He wasn't Italian.

NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY \nTITLE IN: COSTA RICA \nThe camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish- style house. \nNICKY (V.O.) The first one to skip was John Nance. He found a nice, warm secluded place in Costa Rica. He thought nobody would find him there. \nSeveral gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in. BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen. \nNICKY (V.O.) But, then, his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs, and so naturally the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hidin' just to save his kid and give 'em all up.  So... \nCURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE from behind. \nCURLY Hey, where you goin', jag-off? \nNANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away. \nNICKY (V.O.)

BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT \nThe camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a motel corridor. \nGINGER (O.S.) (Gasping) Oh! Oh, no!  No... \nThe camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block wall. \nACE (V.O.) After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody. She found some pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers in LA. And in a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels. \nSuddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies. \nFREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET. \nACE (V.O.) After they found her body... I had a private doctor do another autopsy. He said they gave her... a hot dose. In the end... all she had left was thirty-six hundred in mint-condition coins. \nEND OF MONTAGE \nEXT.

ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car. \nACE (V.O.) ...it was amateur night, and you could tell. Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life. \nACE opens his car door and gets in. \nINT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY \nACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch flames come out of the defroster vents.

Bury 'em. \nMARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, until they are covered up to their necks. \nWe see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still breathing and groaning. \nACE (V.O.) The word was out. The bosses had had enough of Nicky. They had enough. How much were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother. They buried them while they were still breathing. \nA full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with a thud. \nINT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DUSK \nACE is engulfed in flames. His jacket catches fire. He opens the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a smaller explosion.

{"test1_input": "INT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a fit bemoaning his bad luck. \nNICKY (V.O.) But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost. \nGAGGI (Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands) Ma che cazzo! \n[Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' sweeps. \nNICKY (V.O.) I mean, unless Ace made his bet. \nGAGGI That's enough now! \nOLD MAN CAPO I can't contest the cards. \nGAGGI Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning a young man.) Johnny! \nNICKY (V.O.) Ace made more money for them on a weekend than I could do heisting joints for a month. \nACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table. \nNICKY (V.O.) Whatever Ace picked up on the street he told Remo. \nNICKY (Walks over to ACE and whispers) Hey, did you bring that thing? \nNICKY (V.O.) You know, I mean fixed fights, doped horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... locked-in point spreads. He told fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell you the truth. I don't blame him. \nGAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand. \nGAGGI Ace. \nNICKY (V.O.) Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world. \nGAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave. \nGAGGI Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it? \nACE Well, that's why they paid so well. \nGAGGI You see? (Chuckles.) Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week? \nACE Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? \nGAGGI Okay. You come by the house? \nACE I'll come by. \nGAGGI Seven o'clock? \nACE Seven o'clock. \nGAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look on. \nGAGGI Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace? \nACE nods in agreement and leaves the room. \nGAGGI (To NICKY) Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] \nNICKY (To ACE) I'll be right out. \nGAGGI T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? (pointing to the off- screen ACE) \nNICKY Mm. \nGAGGI Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him. \nNICKY Mm. \nGAGGI Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay? \nNICKY All right. \nGAGGI Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] \nNICKY Yeah. \nGAGGI Fine. \nNICKY (Reaching down to touch GAGGI's money, joking with him.) Want me to take this for you? (He walks out.) \nNICKY (V.O.) So, now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure that nobody fucks around with the Golden Jew. \nINT. BACK HOME BAR - NIGHT \nWe move past JOE, a guy at the bar entertaining a BRUNETTE and a BLONDE, to NICKY and FRANK MARINO at the other end. There are other bar patrons in the background. \nJOE (To the BARTENDER) Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies. \nBARTENDER (O.S.) All right. \nACE (V.O.) Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. \nNICKY (To MARINO) They payin'? \nACE (V.O.) How did Nicky collect? \nMARINO They pay every week, like they're supposed to. \nACE (V.O.) Don't ask. \nNICKY Then where the fuck is the money? I don't see the money. \nACE enters, and greets the two girls. \nACE Hi, Melissa. Heidi. \nBLONDE Hi, Sam. \nJOE (To the GIRLS) Who's this guy? \nMARINO (To NICKY) Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine. \nACE approaches NICKY and MARINO. \nNICKY It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game. \nACE Eight. \nNICKY If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight. \nMARINO Well, how come I laid nine? \nNICKY 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten... \nACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the shoulder. \nACE (To JOE) Excuse me. \nJOE What? \nACE (He holds up the pen) Is this yours? Your pen? \nJOE Yeah, that's my pen. Why? \nACE I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost. \nJOE Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off? \nNICKY looks over. \nACE Well, I was just offering you the- \nNICKY moves towards JOE. \nJOE (Turning his back to talk to the girls, referring to ACE) This fuckin' asshole. \nNICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand. \nMAN #1 (To JOE) Look out! \nBefore ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing him in the neck with the pen. \nMAN #1 Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out! \nNICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's throat. JOE tumbles to the floor. \nNICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE whimpers. \nNICKY What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?! \nACE (Over whimpers and pants) Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. \nACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen. \nACE (V.O.) While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. \nNICKY (V.O.) Listen... \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT \nCamera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot- machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and over to a craps table. \nMontage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...with me protecting Ace, he made a fortune for the bosses. I mean that's what got him to Vegas. He was a money machine. A tremendous earner for these guys.  As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop. With Ace the casino never saw so much money. And the bosses, they couldn't be happier. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nCamera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off winners. Chips and money are everywhere. \nIn extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO SLOT-MACHINE AREA - NIGHT \nACE and SHERBERT are walking down a casino aisle by the slot- machines. Dealers immediately snap to attention at their approach. \nACE (V.O.) In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced- in local cowboys working. They were close to the, you know, good old boys. \nACE (To SHERBERT) Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart. \nACE (V.O.) I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit. \nACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly. \n", "test1_true": "WARD bends down and picks up some trash. \nWARD It won't happen again, Sam. \nACE Mr Rothstein. \nACE (To SHERBERT) Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' white man, or what? What's his story? \nSHERBERT We need this guy. \nACE We can't get rid of him? \nSHERBERT He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin. \nACE I wouldn't give the bum a mop job. \nThey exit. \nINT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT \nA card shoe slides across the baccarat table. A state SENATOR, a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder HOOKER with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over to see ACE. \nACE (V.O.) These yokels ran the state. \nDEALER #1 Thank you very much, Senator. \nACE (V.O.) They passed the laws, they owned the courts. \nSENATOR Hi, Ace. \nACE Hello, Senator. \nThey shake hands. \nSENATOR (To ACE) Hey, I need a room. Need a room. \nACE Good to see ya. (To SHERBERT) William would you... \nThe SENATOR shakes hands with SHERBERT as the HOOKER joins them. \nACE (V.O.) I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week. \nSHERBERT Nice to see you, Senator. \nACE (To SHERBERT) Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants. \nSHERBERT Certainly. (Leads the way.) Senator. \nACE (V.O.) Why not make them happy? \nSHERBERT We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite. \nINT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY \nThe SENATOR unzips the HOOKER's dress, kisses her and walks through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight. \nACE (V.O.) For politicians... \nINT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - DAY \nACE smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables. \nACE (V.O.) ...like our state senator up there, everything was on the house. \nINT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY \nThe SENATOR opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet pouch and pours black $100 into his palm. \nACE (V.O.) These guys won their comped life when they got elected. So, hey, why not take advantage of it? Still, the politicians come cheap. We could handle them. \nINT. TANGIERS, ICHIKAWA LUXURY SUITE - DAY \nK. K. ICHIKAWA a Japanese businessman, and a male associate pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite. A blonde woman checks herself in the mirror. \nACE (V.O.) It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, who plays thirty thousand dollars a hand in baccarat. That's the one you really gotta watch. \nICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living- room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch. \nACE (V.O.) He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights. About a year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands. \nThey begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their luggage. \nACE (V.O.) Downstairs, he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels. Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms... \nEXT. TANGIERS JET, LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY \nThe Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as ICHIKAWA shakes ACE's hands before boarding. SHERBERT follows him and his associates aboard. \nACE (V.O.) ...free private jets, and two million of our money. \nACE Nice to see you again. \nACE (V.O.) But we got him back. I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TANGIERS JET, STILL IN THE SAME SPOT - NIGHT \nSHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they all get off the jet. \nSHERBERT Ken, I don't know what the hell went wrong. I'm awfully sorry. \nICHIKAWA This is a big problem. Big problem. \nSHERBERT I can't understand it. These mechanical things, you know, they happen. Hey, be-better here than (gesturing to the sky) up there, you know what I mean? \nINT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT RESERVATION DESK - NIGHT \nSHERBERT arguing with TICKET AGENT as ICHIKAWA and entourage look glum. \nACE (V.O.) Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan. \nAGENT I'm so sorry. There's a convention in town, and all flights are booked. \nSHERBERT A convention? (Turning to ICHIKAWA) I can't believe that there's a convention. It's never... ? \nICHIKAWA What can I do? \nEXT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nA smiling ACE greets ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they drive up and get out of Tangiers limos. \nACE (V.O.) We got him back ...with a whole floor of rooms for himself. \nACE I'm sorry you missed the plane. \nICHIKAWA You want to get my money back, right? (Chuckles) \nACE No, no, no. No gambling. No. \nINT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT \nICHIKAWA, with the Japanese woman, picks up some chips and places them on the table. ACE and SHERBERT watch from behind a barrier. \nACE (V.O.) He bet one thousand a hand instead of his usual thirty thousand a hand. \nA dealer's hands slide two cards on the table. \nDEALER The bank wins a natural eight over a five. \nAnother dealer's hands place two chips on a table. ICHIKAWA looks on. \nACE (V.O.) But I knew, the trick with whales like Ichikawa was that they can't bet small for long. He didn't think of it as winning ten thousand, he thought of it as losing ninety thousand. \nICHIKAWA places a larger bet. \nACE (V.O.) So, he upped his bets... \nA dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on the table. \nICHIKAWA is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him. \nACE (V.O.) ...until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nICHIKAWA, hours later, his chips depleted. ACE and SHERBERT still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are back in the dealer's racks. \nACE (V.O.) In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... \nMove in on ACE as he smokes a cigarette. \nACE (V.O.) ...and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE, with pit bosses next to him, looks out over the huge casino where hundreds of thousands of dollars are being poured into machines. \nACE (V.O.) In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. \nCamera reveals the DEALER at a craps table. \nDEALER Six, an easy way. Six! All right, who's gonna give me... \nThe DEALER places some chips on the table. \nACE (V.O.) Since the players are looking to beat the casino... \nTHE CAMERA IS ON THE DEALER. \nDEALER ...both dice must hit that back wall each and every roll. All right, make a six! \nCAMERA PANS TO A WOMAN AND A MAN AT THE TABLE. THE WOMAN TOSSES SOME DICE. \nACE (V.O.) ...the dealers are watching the players. \nWOMAN Gimme a six! \nDEALER Come on, baby, make a six! \nA BOX MAN, seated mid-table is watching the DEALER. \nACE (V.O.) The box men are watching the dealers. \nCAMERA PANS TO THE DEALER. \n", "test1_id": 1002, "test2_input": "MIKE gets up from the table. \nNICKY (V.O.) They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks. In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket. Then... \nINT. TANGIERS POKER TABLE - NIGHT \nNICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, MOOSH and COWBOY, all secretly signaling each other, sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the crooked dealer from the previous scene, deals NICKY a winning hand. \nNICKY (V.O.) ...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players. \nACE (V.O.) It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy. \nMOOSH (Scratching his arm) I'm gonna open for five hundred. \nROCKY Moosh, you open? (Taps his fingers on some chips before picking them up.) \nACE (V.O.) Signaling back and forth. \nCARD SHARK I bet thirty-five hundred. \nNICKY wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth. \nDOCTOR DAN I've been losing for three days straight, non-stop. \nAnother shark pulls on his ear. \nROCKY Oh, why're you crying, with three loaves of bread under your arm? \nACE watches their signals with concern. \nACE (V.O.) Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong. \nWe see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, sneaking looks at NICKY's table. \nACE (V.O.) And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. \nNICKY Four aces, Doc. \nHis hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces. \nNICKY What do you got? \nDOCTOR DAN (Getting up in disgust) Jesus Christ. I can't believe it. \nCOWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large pot toward his side of the table. \nDOCTOR DAN If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. I'm out of here, you understand? \nACE (V.O.) I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost. \nHe walks towards NICKY's table. \nACE (V.O.) What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war? \nACE leans down to talk to NICKY. \nACE (V.O.) I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. \nACE (Whispering in NICKY's ear) Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. \nNICKY So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? \nACE You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. \nACE walks away. NICKY looks over at the gaming agents. \nNICKY (V.O.) Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino, he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nSecurity people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are fighting. Camera picks up ACE as he passes by them. \nNICKY (V.O.) A million times I wanted to yell in his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas! We're supposed to be out here robbin', you dumb fuckin' Heeb.' \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO POKER TABLE - NIGHT \nCloseup of the COWBOY's white-socked feet with no shoes on a poker table. \nACE (To SHERBERT, referring to COWBOY) I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint? \nSHERBERT approaches COWBOY. \nSHERBERT Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes on, please? \nCOWBOY (Sighs) Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad night. \nCOWBOY remains the same with his feet on the table. \nSHERBERT (Returning to ACE) Fuckin' asshole won't budge. \nACE Call security. \nACE approaches COWBOY. \nACE How are you? \nCOWBOY Good. How are you? \nACE Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on? \nCOWBOY Fuck you. \nACE walks to nearby SECURITY GUARDS. \nACE (To GUARDS) I want you to exit this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fuckin' door. \nThree SECURITY GUARDS approach COWBOY. \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside? \nCOWBOY Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 knocks his feet off the table, as GUARDS #2 and #3 lift him off his seat. \nCOWBOY Fuck you! Fuck you! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Yeah? \nCOWBOY You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Now move along. \nCOWBOY (Screaming at ACE who follows him) You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with? \nThe GUARDS carry him out and forcefully shove him towards a side exit. \nCOWBOY Leave me alone! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Here we go! \nCOWBOY (Grunting) You've gotta be kidding me! (Groans.) \nThe GUARDS lift him off his feet and, holding him like a battering ram, smash his head into the door. \nACE (V.O.) (As COWBOY is thrown out the door) Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call. \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nNICKY is on a public wall-phone talking to ACE. MARINO is staring at the disheveled COWBOY. \nNICKY (Into telephone) Ace, what happened over there? I mean, did you know that guy you threw out was with me? \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE is on a Tangiers house phone. SHERBERT looks on. \nACE (Into telephone) No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? \nNICKY (Over telephone) No. \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nNICKY gives COWBOY a look. \nACE (Over telephone) He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE (Into telephone) ...and he tells me to go fuck myself. \nNICKY (Over telephone) What? \nACE (Into telephone) Then he called me a faggot. \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nACE (Over telephone) So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out. \nNICKY (Into telephone) What? Ho- (He puts down the phone; to COWBOY:) Hey, come here. \nCOWBOY walks up to him. \nNICKY You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself? \nCOWBOY Nicky, I did - \nNICKY Is that what you did? \nCOWBOY I did - I didn't - \nNICKY Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'... \nNICKY hits him on the head with the phone. COWBOY falls back, groaning. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE listens to the noise of NICKY roughing up COWBOY. \nNICKY (Over telephone) ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here. \nACE LOOKS AT SHERBERT. \nMARINO (Over telephone) Get up. \n", "test2_true": "NICKY (To COWBOY) Come here, come here. \nMARINO Get up. \nNICKY You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nNICKY (Over telephone) If you ever get out of line over there again, I'll smash your fuckin' head so hard... \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nNICKY (To COWBOY) ...you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fuckin' hick. (Into telephone) Sammy, listen... \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nNICKY (Over telephone) ...this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talkin' to, you understand? He doesn't... \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nNICKY (Into telephone) ...know that, uh, we're dear friends. I mean, he's already very sorry. But, uh, if you could do me a favor to let him back in, I swear to you he'll never get out of line again. I promise you that. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT \nACE (Into telephone) If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again. \nNICKY (Over telephone) I'm sorry about this. Really. \nINT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT \nNICKY (Into telephone) All right, Ace? \nACE (Over telephone) Okay. \nNICKY (Into telephone) Thanks, pal. \nNICKY hangs up the phone and turns to COWBOY. \nNICKY You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand? (Slapping him.) Go over there and apologize. (Kicking the chastened COWBOY away.) Go! Get the fuck out of - \nCOWBOY Nicky, I'm sorry. \nEXT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY \nA tiger leaps towards the camera, which pans over to two showgirls and then to ACE's hand holding the key to a Rolls Royce. He gives it to JONATHAN and DAVID as reporters rush in to photograph the moment. \nNICKY (V.O.) You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy, especially when he got bigger and bigger in town. Like when he hired that Jonathon and David and their tigers away from the Palace by buildin' them a new stage and then givin' them a silver Rolls Royce. \nINT. BACKSTAGE TANGIERS THEATER - DAY \nACE and SHERBERT watch as a STAGE MANAGER weighs in the 'Femme Fatale' Showgirls. \nNICKY (V.O.) But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons. \nACE (To SHOWGIRL) You're still eight pounds over. (To MANAGER.) What's the reason for this? \nSTAGE MANAGER Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension. \nACE Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'. \nSTAGE MANAGER Well, sir, I was just... \nACE Why is she eight pounds over? \nSTAGE MANAGER ...trying to offer you the respect that your... \nACE I... \nSTAGE MANAGER ...position... \nACE 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. \nSTAGE MANAGER Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows... \nACE She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen... \nSTAGE MANAGER ...and she doesn't always - \nACE ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer. \nSTAGE MANAGER But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. \nACE That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris. \nSTAGE MANAGER It's always been our policy - \nACE No. Just stop everything. \nSHERBERT and ACE walk away across a huge stage. \nSHERBERT (To ACE) This woman's an institution. \nACE I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT \nACE standing in a large space surrounded by giant TV screens showing sports events. Around him, long rows of bettors are seated at betting stations, lined up at windows, or wandering around at the bar. It's like a NASA control room on launch day. \nNICKY (V.O.) Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him. \nACE (V.O.) Between... \nEXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT \nNICKY, with MARINO, punching and kicking a man next to the open door of his luxury car. \nACE (V.O.) ...my innovations... \nThe man falls to the ground. \nACE (V.O.) ...and Nicky's dedication to his job... \nNICKY starts kicking him. \nACE (V.O.) ...I soon had the best operation on the Strip. \nNICKY lifts an empty trash can and shatters the car's windshield. \nINT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT \nACE and NICKY are standing on the casino floor near the slot- machines. Gamblers are milling about behind them. \nACE You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. \nNICKY Why, somebody's complaining? \nACE I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. \nNICKY That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone. \nACE Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. \nNICKY What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all. \nACE I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. \nNICKY All right. \nINT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB, 1974 - NIGHT \nTight on the filaments of a flash bulb as they ignite. \nTV news crews and still photographers are taking pictures of ACE and GINGER surrounded by clusters of celebrities and the Vegas power elite, including SHERBERT and GREEN, at a black tie event. \nPHOTOGRAPHER #1 Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead. Very nice. Thank you. \nPHOTOGRAPHER #2 Thank you. \nPHOTOGRAPHER #1 Yes, nice smile. \nPHOTOGRAPHER #3 Just look right at the camera.

Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?  And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship? \nACE walks over to GINGER at the bar. \nACE (Quietly) Why don't you take it easy with that stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help you. Come on. We're talkin' about some stuff. \nNEWSCASTER (On television) State officials say 'yes' when that relationship and those connections are with anyone as notorious as Nicky Santoro. \nACE takes GINGER's arm and leads her out of the room toward the stairs. \nNEWSCASTER Tonight at six: 'Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers' Casino boss?'

Just... go downst- \nShe struggles to break away from his firm grip, gives him a look and starts to walk down the stairs. \nNEWSCASTER (On television, continuing commercial) Promise to be financially secure? Money Time can help you keep those promises. \nACE looks down on GINGER as she slips on the stairs. \nCHARLIE CLARK You can't let this concern you, Ace. Don't worry about that stuff. \nOutside the glass door NICKY arrives via the stairs from the golf course. \nCHARLIE CLARK (O.S.) It's just a political witch hunt. \nACE opens the sliding glass door and NICKY enters. \nNICKY Hey, Ace. \nACE Hey. \nNICKY walks over to CHARLIE CLARK. \nACE Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill? \nCHARLIE CLARK Yeah, refill'd be great. \nNICKY (Approaching CHARLIE) No, I don't want one. (Smiling, extends his hand.) Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'? \nCHARLIE CLARK (Shaking hands) Hi. Good. \nNICKY (Sitting down with him on a couch) I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President. \nCHARLIE CLARK Well, I've been busy. (Chuckles.) \nNICKY Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though. \nCHARLIE CLARK Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss. \nNICKY Yeah. (Pause.) I think I want my money back. \nCHARLIE CLARK (Chuckling) What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me? \nNICKY You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it. \nCHARLIE CLARK (As he puts a notepad in his briefcase) You can't talk to me like... \nNICKY (Grabbing CHARLIE by his jacket) Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep. \nCHARLIE CLARK (To ACE, panting) Sam? \nNICKY Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal. (Walking with CHARLIE to the stairs.) I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso. \nA frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs. \nNICKY You fuckin' try me. \nHe turns to ACE who's behind the bar. \nNICKY You think he got the point? \nACE (Walking to NICKY) What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI. \nNICKY Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time. \nACE I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? \nNICKY Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way. \nACE Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? \nNICKY Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. (Pause.) You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it? \nACE No, I don't wanna come - \nNICKY You should say so. \nACE I don't wanna come along with you. \nNICKY Just say so. \nACE I'll be honest with you. \nNICKY All right, fine. \nACE I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... \nNICKY Fine. \nNICKY walks to a table and flips through Business Week magazine. \nACE ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. \nNICKY (Holding up the magazine) You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet? \nACE That's all taken out of context. Okay. \nNICKY Yeah, that's out of context. Okay. \nACE I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. \nNICKY Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. \nACE Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. \nNICKY Yeah? \nACE Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. \nNICKY What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me? \nACE What happened to me? What happened to you? \nNICKY Yeah. \nACE You lost your control. \nNICKY I lost control? \nACE Yes, you lost your control. \nNICKY Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore. \nACE All right. \nNICKY A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... \nACE All right. \nNICKY ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?! \nACE Yeah. \nNICKY You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife. \nACE My wife? \nNICKY Yeah. \nACE Now, what does she have to do with all this? \nNICKY Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. \nACE All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? \nNICKY No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. \nACE Listen, I would - \nNICKY (Interrupting) The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. \nACE I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. \nNICKY Hey, she came to talk... \nACE Please... \nNICKY ...to me. \nACE ...don't do it to me... \nNICKY She came to talk to me... \nACE Okay? \nNICKY And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out? \nACE Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. \nNICKY It's none of my business? \nACE That's right, yeah. \nNICKY A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. \nACE Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. \nNICKY starts to walk out. \nACE This guy is gonna run to the FBI. \nNICKY Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino.

136. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK 
As secretary's voice comes over dictograph: 
CEDAR 
Yes? 
SECRETARY'S VOICE 
Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting. 
CEDAR 
(irritated) 
I can't help it. Let them wait! 
He snaps the dictograph off. 
137. MED. SHOT GROUP 
FIRST BROTHER 
Those people have been in to see me every day this week. 
2ND BROTHER 
Who are they ? 
CEDAR 
(dismissing it) 
Relatives of old man Semple. 
FIRST BROTHER 
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value. 
CEDAR 
Nuisance value? 
FIRST BROTHER 
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money. 
CEDAR 
(suddenly) 
Nuisance value. 
(thinks a minutes - crosses to door) 
Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! 
(opens door) 
Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do? 
The others all stand around - as the Semples enter. 
MRS. SEMPLE 
We've been trying to 
138. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND THE SEMPLES 
CEDAR 
(smoothly cutting her off) 
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. How are you, sir? I don't know what my secretary could 
have been thinking to keep you waiting this long. 
(to one of his brothers) 
Will you bring the chairs? Quickly. Will you have a cigar, Mr. Semple? 
MR. SEMPLE 
Thanks. 
Semple takes the cigar - rather flabbergasted at all the sudden attention showered upon him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ROOF OF TALL BUILDING - NIGHT 
139. MED. SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE 
From over their shoulders, looking down on the lights and teeming activity of Times Square. 
BABE 
There's Times Square. 
LONGFELLOW 
You can almost spit on it, can't you? 
BABE 
Why don't you try? 
He does try. The wind blows it back on him. She laughs, takes out a handkerchief and wipes it off his coat. 
BABE 
(as she wipes) 
Oh! It's breezy up here. 
He doesn't say anything right away. 
BABE 
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you? 
LONGFELLOW 
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you? 
A guilty look spreads over Babe's face. 
BABE 
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know. 
LONGFELLOW 
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while? 
An awkward pause. 
BABE 
Shall we go? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT 
140. MED. TRUCKING SHOT 
As Babe and Longfellow walk.

(spotting a park bench) 
Here's a nice place.

Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around. 
EXT. PARK - BEHIND SOME BUSHES 
141. MEDIUM SHOT 
Bob and Frank, sneaking around in the bushes. 
142. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE 
BABE 
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal. 
LONGFELLOW 
What's that? 
BABE 
You said I was a lady in distress. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, that 
BABE 
What did you mean by that? 
LONGFELLOW 
Nothing 
There is a pause. 
LONGFELLOW 
Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged or anything? 
143. CLOSEUP - BABE 
The corners of her mouth go up in sympathetic amusement. 
BABE 
No. Are you? 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
No. 
BABE 
You don't go out with girls very much, do you? 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
I haven't. 
BABE 
Why not? 
144. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Favoring Longfellow. 
LONGFELLOW

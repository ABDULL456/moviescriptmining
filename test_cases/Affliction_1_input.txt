Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat, examines it, as if unsure of its function. 
Wade walks toward Town Hall. MARGIE FOGG, exiting, greets him: 
MARGIE New hat? (no answer) Jill's up, I see. 
WADE (vague) For a while. 
MARGIE How's she doing? 
WADE Okay. She's fine. 
MARGIE You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off. 
NICK WICKHAM, 45, Marg's boss, passes by: 
WICKHAM Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first day of deer season. I'll need you at least in the morning. 
MARGIE (shrugs) Well, that's that. 
NICK (walks off) Take care, Wade. 
WADE You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know. 
MARGIE (laughs) Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break. 
WADE See you tomorrow, maybe. 
MARGIE You okay? 
WADE Yeah. 
Wade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall. At the door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. Wade tosses Horner's hat inside. 
WADE Tomorrow, Gordon. 
LARIVIERE Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight. 
Wade nods as he lights a cigarette. Alone, he watches the last cars pull out. He holds his jaw. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WADE'S TRAILER HOME - DAWN 
Pre-dawn light silhouettes a dozen weather-beaten mobile homes set off Route 29. Snow continues to fall. A sheet of white stretches down Parker mountain. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WADE'S TRAILER - DAWN 
6:40. A clock radio pierces the silence with classic rock. Wade Whitehouse rolls over, runs his tongue across mossy teeth, shuts off the music. He looks out the window, grunts: "Shit!" He steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch, dials. 
Wade's trailer is surprisingly neat, considering its owner smokes too much, drinks too much, eats take-out and rarely cleans up. 
WADE (on phone) Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin? (fumbles for cigarette) Look, I was wondering, with the snow and all, if you got school today? (lights cigarette) How the hell do I know? You're the principal. All I'm supposed to do is direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30. (listens) Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just now saw it was snowing, that's all. My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow all day. If I don't get over to LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck with the grader. I was just hoping you'd have called school off. (beat) You check the weather bureau? (acquiesces) Okay, I hear you. I'll be over in a bit. (hangs up) 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WADE'S TRAILER HOME EARLY - MORNING 
Jack Hewitt's 4x4 passes Wade's trailer, continues up 29. Tire chains splice the path.

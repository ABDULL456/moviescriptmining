LINCOLN (O.C.) What's the matter, Bob? 
Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth. 
ROBERT I have to do this! And I will do it and I don't need your permission to enlist. 
LINCOLN That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began? "I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man." 
ROBERT It's mama you're scared of, not me getting killed. 
Lincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both. 
Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) I have to do this! And I will! Or I will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life. Whether or not you fought is what's gonna matter. And not just to other people, but to myself. I won't be you, pa. I can't do that. But I don't want to be nothing. 
He hurries away. 
LINCOLN We can't lose you. 
INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Outside, driving rain and wind. Lincoln sits by the window, in his coat, vest and tie, hair combed neatly. 
LINCOLN He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant. 
Mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale with rage. 
MARY The war will take our son! A sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or typhus, same as took Willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll die, uselessly, and how will I ever forgive you? Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret! 
LINCOLN That's not true - 
MARY And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant, God help us! We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear BLOOD - 
Lincoln rises from the window seat, angry. 
LINCOLN Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln, I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?! 
MARY (with a mocking smile:) And if I refuse to take the high road, if I won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when I couldn't stop crying over Willie, when I showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me - 
LINCOLN MARY That's right. When you I was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him in Tad - my arms as he died! 
LINCOLN MARY - the child who was not only How dare you! sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief? 
LINCOLN MARY Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief! 
LINCOLN MARY And his mother won't let him I couldn't let Tad in! I near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry I was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts! I ought to have done it, I ought have done for Tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, I should have clapped you in the madhouse! 
MARY (CONT'D) THEN DO IT! Do it! Don't you threaten me, you do it this time! Lock me away! You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed! 
Silence. Then: 
LINCOLN I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself, though I wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. I still do. Every day I do. Don't... talk to me about grief. (BEAT:) I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours. And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as I must. And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. As you choose. 
She opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and watches as he leaves the room. 
INT. ODD FELLOWS' HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT 
Onstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night. MARGUERITE and FAUST are alone singing. The Lincolns, in their box, watch quietly. Elizabeth Keckley sits next to Mary. 
Mary turns to Lincoln. They speak in whispers. Mrs. Keckley tries not to listen but she can't help hearing what they say. 
MARY You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done. When have I ever been so easily bamboozled? (BEAT) I believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war. And since you are sending my son into the war, woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment. 
LINCOLN Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town. 
MARY No one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths. Seward can't do it. You must. Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes, woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me. 
EXT. THE PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE - A SHORT WHILE LATER 
The carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White House. Lincoln helps Mrs. Keckley down from the carriage. 
She hesitates before proceeding in. Then she faces Lincoln. 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY I know the vote is only four days away; I know you're concerned. Thank you for your concern over this, and I want you to know: They'll approve it. God will see to it.

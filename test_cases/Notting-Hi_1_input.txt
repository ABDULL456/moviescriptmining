WILLIAM Pathetic effort to hog the brownie. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Anna and William are leaving. 
ANNA That was such a great evening. 
MAX I'm delighted. 
He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek. He stumbles back with joy. 
ANNA And may I say that's a gorgeous tie. 
MAX Now you're lying. 
ANNA You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. 
Max loves this. 
ANNA (to Bella) Lovely to meet you. 
BELLA And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian. 
MAX No! 
ANNA Night, night, Honey. 
HONEY I'm so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to leave but I just... look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with.  I know lots of nice, cheap places... not that money necessarily... (gives up) nice to meet you. 
And Honey gives her a huge hug. 
ANNA You too -- from now on you are my style guru. 
Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity. 
BERNIE Love your work. 
They move to the door and wave goodbye. 
EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true feelings.  William is a little embarrassed. 
WILLIAM Sorry -- they always do that when I leave the house. 
The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill. They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence. 
ANNA Floppy, huh? 
WILLIAM It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair. 
ANNA Why is she in a wheelchair? 
WILLIAM It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago. 
ANNA And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident? 
WILLIAM You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it. 
They walk in silence for a moment.  Then... 
WILLIAM Would you like to come... my house is just...? 
She smiles and shakes her head. 
ANNA Too complicated. 
WILLIAM That's fine. 
ANNA Busy tomorrow?

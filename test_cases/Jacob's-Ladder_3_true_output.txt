JEZZIE They're weird names. 
JACOB They're Biblical. They were prophets. 
JEZZIE Well, personally, I never went for church names. 
JACOB And where do you think Jezebel comes from? 
JEZZIE I don't let anybody call me that. 
JACOB (shaking his head) You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny? 
JEZZIE You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me. 
JACOB Yeah, but for what? 
JEZZIE A good lay. 
JACOB And look what I got. 
JEZZIE The best. 
JACOB I must have been out of my head. 
JEZZIE Jake, you are never out of your head! 
JACOB (ignoring the criticism and reaching for the paper bag) What's in here? 
JEZZIE Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school. 
JACOB lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed. There are hundreds of them. He examines them with growing delight. 
JACOB Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida. 
JEZZIE Lemme see. 
JACOB (rummaging excitedly through the pile) Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College. 
JEZZIE (looking closely) That's Sarah? (she studies the photo) I can see what you mean. 
JACOB What? 
JEZZIE Why you left. 
JACOB What do you mean you can see? 
JEZZIE Look at her face. A real bitch. 
JACOB She looked good then. 
JEZZIE Not to me. 
JACOB Well, you didn't marry her. 
He digs through more photos. Suddenly he stops. 
JEZZIE What's wrong? 
To JEZZIE's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes. For a moment JACOB is unable to speak. He just stares at one of the photos. JEZZIE looks at the picture. It is an image of JACOB carrying a small child on his shoulders. 
JEZZIE Is that the one who died? 
JACOB (nodding) Gabe. 
JEZZIE is silent. JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose. 
JACOB (continuing) Sorry. it just took me by surprise. I didn't expect to see him this morning ... God, what I wouldn't ... He was the cutest little guy. Like an angel, you know. He had this smile ... (choking up again) Fuck, I don't even remember this picture. 
Hiding his emotions, JACOB scrambles over the bed and reaches for a pair of pants. He pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the photo of GABE inside. It joins photos of his two other boys. JEZZIE begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag. 
JACOB Wait. Don't. 
JEZZIE I don't like things that make you cry. 
JACOB I just want to look ... 
He reaches into the pile for other snapshots. We see an array of frozen moments, happy, unfocused, obscure. Suddenly he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot. 
JACOB God, this is me! (he holds up a baby photo) Look. It's dated right after I was born. (he stares at it intently) What a kid. Cute, huh? So much promise. 
JEZZIE surveys the scene. 
JEZZIE It's amazing, huh Jake? Your whole life ... right in front of you. (she pauses before making her final pronouncement) What a mess! 
INT.  HALLWAY - DAY 
JEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the hall. She is carrying several bags. Two of them are tossed instantly down the chute. She hesitates with the third. After a moment she reaches into it and pulls out a handful of photos. They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH. With cool deliberation she drops them down the chute. An apartment door slams shut. Quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand. JACOB opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the memories of his life falls to the fire below.

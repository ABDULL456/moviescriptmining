The Clerk is reading a paper. He hears a noise and pulls it aside. Mariachi is standing at the counter smiling. The Clerk jumps in his seat, then after a few frozen seconds he sets down his paper and reaches for Mariachi's old room key. 
Mariachi shakes his head "no", points to the register, and makes the money sign with his hand. The Clerk slowly moves over to the register. He depresses a few keys to open it. It won't open. He makes a gesture like it's stuck or something (he is not very convincing). He tries again and again; each time pretending to get more impatient.Mariachi glances down at the Pit Bull. The Pit Bull is eyeing Mariachi. Mariachi points to the Clerk as if he has an inside joke with the dog ("this guy..."). Mariachi climbs over the counter and stands next to the Clerk. The Clerk things Mariachi is a lunatic. Mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing the Clerk for a demonstration. Mariachi then leaps over the counter landing firmly back on the other side of the counter. 
CLOSEUP of his feet landing hard, just as before. 
The register opens. Mariachi shrugs, smiles, and reaches into the register, taking his money out himself. He counts it. After a brief consideration, he decides to leave the old man a tip. Mariachi waves a "good-bye" wave and dances out. The old man, still standing there with his arms outstretched as if he was robbed, dashes to the phone and calls Moco's men.

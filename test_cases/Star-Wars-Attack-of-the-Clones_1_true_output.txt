LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech. 
LAMA SU I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. 
OBI-WAN You make me feel most welcome. 
LAMA SU And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way. 
OBI-WAN (improvising) That is... good news. 
LAMA SU Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope? 
OBI-WAN I'm sorry Master - ? 
LAMA SU Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not? 
OBI-WAN Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas. 
LAMA SU (rising) You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. 
OBI-WAN That's why I'm here. 
EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly. 
Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers. 
PADMÉ I don't know... 
ANAKIN Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me. 
PADMÉ Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me? 
ANAKIN They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded. 
PADMÉ All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes. 
ANAKIN All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him? 
PADMÉ I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist. 
ANAKIN Maybe he was the smart one. 
PADME You really don't like politicians, do you? 
ANAKIN I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. (smiling) I don't think the system works. 
PADME How would you have it work? 
ANAKIN We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it. 
PADME That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do. 
ANAKIN Then they should be made to. 
PADME By whom? Who's going to make them? 
ANAKIN I don't know. Someone. 
PADME You? 
ANAKIN Of course not me. 
PADME But someone. 
ANAKIN Someone wise. 
PADME That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. 
A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

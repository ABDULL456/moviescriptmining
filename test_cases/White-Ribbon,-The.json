{"test1_input": "The courtyard is full of people, dressed in their Sunday best:   Farmers,  seasonal-workers,   people  from   the village, children and teenagers. A dance hall has been set up. On it we see the landowner, the steward and the pastor with their families. A couple of younger women, a delegation of the harvesters, goes over to present the harvest crown to the landowner. \nHARVESTER: ...with our songs and our prayers We've gathered the rye and given that crown to your lordship. It is not big, it is not small, But pretty, nice and fine. Not with thistles or thorns is it made, but with pure grain. Had our lordship sowed more, The men would've scythed more And we girls gathered more. We girls have gathered the grain, Over mountains and valleys, Over thistles and thorn, Over the fields of our lordship. I wish our lordship a happy life, As many years as there's sand on the beach As many years as there are drops in the rain So much may our lordship be blessed. And as a reward to be of good cheer We'd like for our folks a barrel of beer, And if we could have a fried goose perchance Then we'll all be ready to dance. During the poem, the camera has shown all those we have met until now. They have all ( except for the Doctor, the farmer and his two eldest sons) come to the feast. While all the folks present LAUGH and SHOUT, the maid, with a clumsy curtsy, hands over the harvest crown to the Baron. The village band plays a fanfare. As soon as the hullabaloo has died down BARON(answering): My thanks to all of you. Thank you very much. You have worked well and the heavens were merciful, and now the barns are full. Therefore there's more than enough beer, and you won't starve today. He points to the open barn, where food and beer are waiting. In front of the barn are tables with long benches. BARON: Enjoy your meal!! Eat and drink as much as you wish. You deserve it. \nAgain the people YELL and CHEER. Then, the MUSIC starts and the feast is off and running. \n20. VEGETABLE GARDEN OF THE MANOR EXT/DAY The vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house. In the distance we hear the MUSIC from the feast. Franz, in working clothes, comes over, opens a gate in the fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbages and slices them all off with his scythe. The whole scene looks like a mass execution. \n21. ESTATE EXT/DAY The party is in full swing: people dance and shout, children run around, young men quarrel and show off in front of the young girls. Older women are stand around in groups, gossiping. Some farmers are gathered around the landowner \u00ad he is friendly with them, but we don't understand what they're talking about. His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place in this crowd. She's talking to the schoolteacher. BEATRIX: ...didn't you promise us a little chorale sung by your prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. SCHOOLTEACHER: You have to talk to the pastor, Baroness. We're still busy studying the choir pieces for the confirmation feast. BEATRIX (amused): But that's in spring, my dear. This is the start of autumn. SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles, embarrassed): I know, but unfortunately not all of our little singers are very musical. I'm sorry if... \n22. ESTATE. UNDER THE LIME TREE . EXT/DAY A quieter part of the estate. Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers of the landowner's family, a small table and a few chairs. Eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful bustle. Sitting beside her, turning her back to the manor, is Emma, the steward's wife who is breastfeeding her baby. The steward separates from a group of men and comes over to the two women. As he comes over, he shouts to them: \nSTEWARD: Well, you two \"mothers\"? Don't you want to be part of the festivities? Eva looks at the steward's wife, not knowing, how to react to the \"mother joke\". But the slightly naive wife of the steward is basically fond of any jokes her husband cracks. She turns halfway to him and says: EMMA: It's so nice here in the shade. In the meantime the steward has come over. He's smoking a pipe. STEWARD (in excellent mood): Well, our son seems to be enjoying that, right?! EMMA: Yes. STEWARD: I can imagine. Who wouldn't like that. EMMA (rebuking him gently): Georg! STEWARD (to Eva): What about you? Don't you get bored taking care of other people's children, with all the young lads over there? EVA (uneasy, with forced sweetness): No Sir, I love to be with the children. He gives his wife a short glance, then sits on a chair beside Eva: How old are you anyway? EVA: Eighteen, Sir. STEWARD: Eighteen! And you want me to believe you'd rather hold the Baroness's baby in your arms than your true love? EMMA (good-naturedly): Come on, Georg, leave her alone. STEWARD: I'm not doing her any harm. Can you get us something to eat, Emma? EVA (stands up, to Emma): If you mind the children for a moment, I'll get us something. STEWARD (stands up too): Don't worry, princess, I'm going. Not to panic. \n23. ESTATE. THE PATH LEADING TO THE VEGETABLE GARDEN. EXT/DAY A bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up in their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both wearing  their  white  ribbons,  the  pastor's  other \nchildren, Xenia, Rudolph as well as Hans, Liesl, Georg, Ferdinand and Sigi. They leave the manor and head toward the fields. As they pass by the vegetable garden, they notice the sliced off cabbages and stop. Some laugh at it, others are unsettled. Most of the children keep run on out into the open fields. \n", "test1_true": "FARMHANDS and FARMERS: More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down, hurray! More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down. Has the landlord hung himself, that he doesn't serve me any beer? More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down! \nLaughter. Leni, Franz's sister, and another farmgirl do their best to cater to the drinker's thirst as fast as possible. The two young women try to keep their spirits up, but the guest's indelicate jokes and rude gestures don't make it easy. \nLENI: I'm coming. I haven't got a magic wand. FIRST FARMHAND (with a grin): Shall I help you, Leni? I'd love to help you. SECOND FARMHAND (also grinning): What do you want to help her with?! LAUGHTER. FIRST FARMHAND: All over. Front and backside. \nMore LAUGHTER. THIRD FARMHAND (to Leni): Are you as slow with the Baron? SECOND TENANT FARMER: Come on, leave her alone SECOND FARMHAND: You like her that much? Go and help her. FOURTH FARMHAND (sitting beside the second, almost in a whisper): Don't you know: it was her mother who had that accident?... At the same time a boy of ten comes over to the first farmer and butts in to his story: BOY: Father, they cut off the Baron's cabbages. FIRST TENANT FARMER: What's that? BOY (grin): They cut off the Baron's cabbages. Leni, who's just putting some glasses with beer on the table, glares at the boy, flabbergasted. \n25.   ESTATE. DANCE FLOOR. EXT/DAY \nOn the dance floor, Eva and the schoolteacher try to dance. Neither is very talented. Eva keeps looking at her feet and smiles, embarrassed. EVA: I never learned it. SCHOOLTEACHER (also with a smile): Neither did I. You just have to count out loud. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One... Their steps are far too big. They look clumsy and embarrassed, but happy. After a few spins EVA: Aren't you afraid your students might laugh at you, when they see you dancing with me that way, sir. SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): They'd better not! And stop being so formal with me. I'm not that old, am I? Eva laughs, embarrassed and looks down. EVA: One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. SCHOOLTEACHER: You see: we're getting better. EVA: Well. SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop looking at your feet. \nShe lifts her head, looks at him and... stumbles. They laugh and start again. \n26. VEGETABLE GARDEN EXT/DAY MUSIC of the village band can be heard coming from the manor. The Baroness reaches the vegetable garden, followed by the pastor's wife, the tutor and some \"ladies\" from the village. Behind the fence, among the \"beheaded\" cabbages are the Baron, the steward and some farmers. A couple of curious onlookers have gathered by the fence. Mutters, and now and then laughter. The Baron turns to his wife and, with a snicker, points to the \"heads\" lying around him. BARON: Quite a job, isn't it?! The Baroness looks at the extent of the disaster. Then says, revolted: BARONESS: This is disgusting. The steward comes over to them and, with a little grin, comments on the sensitivity of his masters: STEWARD: It used to be an old custom (he quotes): \"Now that the harvesting's done, \"It's time to pay us, every one, \"Any miser who leaves us in a rut, \"He shall have his cabbage cut. \n", "test1_id": 1944, "test2_input": "EVA (after a pause, serious again): Who could have done such things? \nSCHOOLTEACHER: What? \nEVA: To beat a child that way. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. \nLong PAUSE. Then she says softly: \nEVA: Can I stay here tonight?         Don't send me away, sir, please. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: How can you think something like that? \nEVA: I'll just wait for the daylight to come. Here in the classroom. Then I'll leave. \nSuddenly she starts to cry again: \n", "test2_true": "PAUSE. Then the \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Do you want me to come with you. \nShe stops crying and looks at him, surprised. \nEVA: What did you say? \nSCHOOLTEACHER    (cheerful):   Tomorrow,   after school? I can try to find us a carriage. I'll be back by evening. \nEVA: And why should you do that, Sir. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Stop being so formal. \nEVA (after a break): Why should you do this? \n", "test2_id": 1945, "test3_input": "LIESL,(defiantly, as he's not believing her): Because he's jealous. SCHOOLTEACHER: And because you believe that, you dreamt it. It doesn't mean anything at all. It's just a coincidence. LIESL (keeping her head bowed): All right. \nThe schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Look at me. \nShe looks at him reluctantly, maintaining her defiant reserve. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Don't tell such stories to anybody! You obviously don't realize the harm you can do with it. Again she looks down at the floor. You didn't tell the story         to   your   parents, didn't you? She shakes her head. All right then. Forget it quickly.   I   shall    forget     it,   too. Promise? As she doesn't answer, he repeats: Promise? \nShe nods almost imperceptibly. \nGood. Now can I have my handkerchief back... \nHe holds his hand out to her. Astonished she looks at the handkerchief in her hands. She had forgotten it completely, and gives it back the schoolteacher. Thank you. He pockets the handkerchief. Now, we both have a secret. And you promise me that it will remain a secret between us. All right? She nods reluctantly. He insists, seeks her gaze: Yes?! LIESL (reluctantly): Yes. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well. All right then. You don't have to worry. Nothing will happen to Hansi. (smiling): Nobody is jealous of him. \nShe glances at him to see whether he's making fun of her. He looks at her seriously and gives her a nod that demands an answer. She nods briefly. But it isn't clear whether she just does it to please him. Dreams don't come true. That only happens in fairy-tales. Forget all about it. He looks at her, as she stands there, head bowed. Finally he smiles and tries to \"crack a joke\" to make the matter less serious: Do you know what they did to little girls who predicted the future in ancient times? They burned them at the stake as witches. She looks up at him, round-eyed. \n", "test3_true": "61. STREET. EXT/DAY The schoolteacher and Eva drive in the carriage. In the background, we catch glimpses of the town. \nNARRATOR: We had arranged to meet at the town railway station, since Eva wanted to avoid being seen with me. She was living with distant relatives,   who    were    apparently   reporting regularly to Eva's parents about her life-style. She had become thinner which made her even prettier, and once again I was ravished by her mixture   of   shyness    and    almost  childlike outspokenness. EVA (imitating somebody): ...\"...You want your hair parted r to the right or to the left?\" \"How about one parting to the left and one to the right\"? Both laugh heartily. All the people in the saloon were laughing their heads   off.    Even    Mr.    Murer,   who's   so distinguished that he never cracks a smile, had to laugh. SHORT PAUSE, in which the laughter fades down. SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, it isn't really so awful, is it? EVA: No. But sweeping up hair all day \u00ad honestly the twins were more fun, I must say. But it's all right. I can't really complain. \nThe schoolteacher looks at her sideways, smiling: SCHOOLTEACHER: No? She looks at him, doesn't understand that he's trying to make her complain about their forced separation, and says cheerfully: EVA: No. Really. The schoolteacher exchanges a smiling glance with her, then looks back at the road: SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling): And apart from the twins, there's nothing you're missing? She looks at him, surprised. Suddenly, she understands. She shakes her head with a smile, then takes his hand for a short moment, as if she were apologizing for her lack of sensitivity. EVA: Oh, you of course! He looks at her hand on his, but she already has withdrawn it. Both seem very happy. After a few moments, during which the horse keeps trotting, Eva leans against the schoolteacher and puts her head against his shoulder. But the shaking of the carriage on the rutted road makes that position untenable and so they sit side by side again and drive on. Finally \nEVA says: And how is the nurse? Does she only speak Italian? SCHOOLTEACHER: I   don't   know.   That's   what   the steward told me. EVA: I see. At that moment the road crosses a brook, that runs through a small wood. The schoolteacher steers the carriage on to a trail that branches off the road after the bridge. EVA: Where are you going? SCHOOLTEACHER: Over there, into the forest beside the brook. We can picnic over there. I brought a basket of food. EVA (softly): I don't want that. SCHOOLTEACHER (perplexed): Why? Eva looks down and shakes her head. The schoolteacher stops the carriage, turns to her: What's going on? EVA: Nothing. Please. Now he understands. He smiles although he can't really understand that she's been thinking such a thing of him. Now he talks to her almost as to a child, astonished and reassuringly. SCHOOLTEACHER:   But  I   don't  want   anything forbidden from you. I just wanted you to enjoy the picnic. She looks up at him. EVA: Please. SCHOOLTEACHER (astonished): Do you think, I might want to bring disgrace on my future wife? She keeps looking at him pleadingly. Finally he gives in, slightly disappointed: All right then. I'll turn over there. He drives on. After a few meters, Eva puts her hand on his hands and on the reins. He stops the carriage, she looks at him. EVA: Thanks. He doesn't know what say. They look at each other. Suddenly Eva leans forward and kisses him on the lips very cautiously. They remain that way for a long while without their bodies touching each other. After separating, they forget at first to keep breathing. Then, once the worst of the confusion has abated, they both turn away from each other. The schoolteacher lets the horse start trotting again, and \nthey sit side by side on the bumping vehicle, looking straight ahead, quiet and overwhelmed by the happiness of the moment. \n62. CHURCH INT/DAY The church is packed. The 8 candidates for confirmation are kneeling at the Communion bench. One after the other, the pastor puts the cup to their lips. \nPASTOR: Accept and drink! This is the blood of the New Testament, Shed for the forgiveness of your sins. \nAs he reaches Marie, who is kneeling fifth in line, he hesitates a long moment. For so long, that this causes a few irritated stares from the devout parish. Even more than the other children, Marie is also numb with excitement. It almost looks like she might faint again. But then he holds out the cup to her too, and she drinks: \n", "test3_id": 1946}

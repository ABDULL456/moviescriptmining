{"train": "THE WHITE RIBBON \nWritten by \nMichael Haneke \n1. COVERED RIDING SCHOOL OF THE MANORIAL ESTATE INT/DAY MONTAGE OF CLOSE-SHOTS: \nA man is riding a dressage horse. We can't see his face. Only his boots, spurs, whip, the taut reins, the horse's foamy mouth, the movements that steer the animal. We watch him for a while and hear the SNORTS of the horse, the dull SOUND of THE HOOVES on the ground, the fast-uttered COMMANDS of the rider. Then we start to hear a gentle voice: \nNARRATOR (o.s.):I don't know if the story that I want to tell you, reflects the truth in every detail. Much of it I only know by hearsay, and a lot of it remains obscure to me even today, and I must leave it in darkness. Many of these questions remain without answer. But I believe I must tell of the strange events that occurred in our village, because they may cast a new light on some of the goings-on in this country... \nLONG SHOT OF THE RIDING STABLES. The rider is the village doctor, a gaunt, intellectual- looking man of around 60, who has finished his dressage session, and now rides toward the open gate beside the CAMERA, goes through it and into the landscape. We see him in the avenue, now visible behind him, and watch him grow smaller until he vanishes. \nNARRATOR (o.s. continuing):...Everything began, if I remember correctly, with the doctor's riding accident. After his dressage session in the manor's riding school, he was first headed for his home... \n2.   THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY \nWe see the schoolteacher, a slight man, hardly 30 years old, talking inside to some of the older students. Martin, a tall gangly boy of around 12, whose elegant clothes make him stand out among the other children coming out of the school, turns to the midwife: \nMARTIN: Were you at Xenia's place? He's interrupted by Marie, a delicate, pretty and polite girl of around 13 who has the odd characteristic of already behaving like an adult. MARIE: Can't you say hello? Good afternoon, Mrs. Wagner, excuse me. MIDWIFE: Hello, Marie. \nMARIE: We're so worried, you know. That's why Martin forgot his manners. MIDWIFE: That's all right. MARIE: How is the Doctor? MIDWIFE: Not very well. MARIE: Will he have to stay in the hospital? MIDWIFE: I don't know. \nThe midwife is tired of Marie's precocious and endless questions. She peers over the heads of children surrounding them, looking for someone in the classroom. \nMARIE: We'll take care of Xenia. Maybe, we can help her somehow. MIDWIFE (distracted): Good idea. It'll cheer her up. She has seen her son, who's coming out of the door: he is a mongoloid boy of 8. His name is Hans. He hesitates, as he sees his mother surrounded by the others. The midwife leaves the group and goes over to him. MIDWIFE: Well, did you enjoy the singing? HANS (nods eagerly): It was great! The schoolteacher comes in. SCHOOLTEACHER: Show your mother what you've been singing. Hans looks doubtfully, first at the schoolteacher, then at his mother, who nods at him encouragingly. After hesitating for a second, he starts to SING: \nHANS: La... La... lalala... MARIE turns to leave. \nMARIE: Good-bye, Sir. Good-bye, Mrs. Wagner. Her saying good-bye acts as an invitation to the other children: they also SAY GOOD-BYE, though some less distinctively, and follow the girl. TRACKING SHOT with the children. After a short distance, Georg, a strong boy of around 13, shouts, encouraging the others: \nGEORG: Last one is a rotten egg! \nThen he sprints off. Most of the children follow him. But Marie and some of the other kids merely walk off at a brisk pace. The CAMERA, that stopped when Georg ran off, now FOLLOWS Marie, so that, after a while, the others can be seen again at the far end of the street. \n7.   RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHT Marie and Martin come through the door and stand in front of it. At the dinner table, the pastor (in his mid-forties) sits with his back to the door. In front of him, at the other end of the table, sits his wife Anna, a woman in her late forties. On the sides of the table sit the children: Anton (11), Magdalena (10), Katharina (9) and Florian (7). Two other places are empty. The table is set for 8 people, but the plates are empty. SILENCE. MARIE (quietly): Please forgive us. MARTIN (following her lead): Please forgive us. SILENCE. Then the pastor speaks very quietly, without turning to the two children: \nPASTOR: There's no question of forgiving. You haven't offended me. It's your mother and your brothers and sisters that you have frightened away and offended. Ask them for forgiveness. You amaze me. I didn't know that the two oldest and therefore most reasonable of my children wouldn't mind frightening their mother and brothers and sisters to death. \nHe turns around toward the two children: Are you now grown up enough to live on your own? Are you? Do you want to leave home and start a life of your own? So you can come and go as you please, and nobody gets in your way. Is that what you want? The two remain silent, their heads bowed. The pastor turns his back to them again, and faces the table. \nNobody at this table has eaten tonight. When it grew dark, and you hadn't returned, your mother went all over the village in tears, looking for you. Do you really think we could've enjoyed our meal, if we feared something had happened to you? Do you think we can enjoy our meal now, when you've come back and dish up lies as an excuse? I don't know what's worse: your absence or your coming back. (PAUSE). Tonight we shall all go to bed hungry. \nHe stands up, followed by the mother and the children who were sitting at the table. Again he turns to the two wrongdoers: PASTOR: You probably agree with me, that I cannot leave your offense unpunished, if we want keep living in mutual respect. So, tomorrow evening at this hour, I shall give each of you 10 strokes of the cane. Until then, you have time to ponder over your offense. Do you agree with me? MARIE and MARTIN: Yes, Father. PASTOR: All right then. Go to bed now, all of you. The children who were sitting at the table go first to their mother, then to their father. They kiss their hands and leave the room. As Marie and Martin want to do the same, the father says PASTOR: I refuse to be touched by you. Your mother and I will sleep poorly because we know I have to hurt you tomorrow, and because it will more painful to us than the strokes will be painful to you. Leave us alone and go to bed. As the two children are about to leave the room, he says PASTOR: When you were small, your mother once in a while would tie a ribbon in your hair or around your arm. Its white color was to remind you of innocence and purity. I thought that at your age you were well-mannered enough to get by without such reminders. I was wrong. Tomorrow, once you've been purified by your punishment, \nyour mother will tie such a ribbon on you again, and you'll wear it until your behavior shows us that we can trust you again. \n8.    THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY CLOSE ANGLE: one of the trees to which the wire was tied that tripped up the doctor's horse. A policeman is looking for clues. With him are Xenia, Rudolph, the midwife and her son Hans. The    two  boys   don't  show   much  interest  in   the investigation. They run after each other in the garden and the neighboring fields. Hans especially seems enjoy this, and is shrieking with delight. POLICEMAN: Where is the wire now? The midwife looks at Xenia, who shrugs her shoulders. POLICEMAN: Then who took it away? XENIA: I don't know. POLICEMAN: You weren't here? \nXenia, uncertain, looks at the midwife. \nPOLICEMAN:   Did   you   accompany   your   father?   To town? XENIA: No. POLICEMAN: That means you were here. XENIA: I was in school. Today. POLICEMAN: And when you left for school, the wire was still here? XENIA: I didn't check. \nThe courtyard is full of people, dressed in their Sunday best:   Farmers,  seasonal-workers,   people  from   the village, children and teenagers. A dance hall has been set up. On it we see the landowner, the steward and the pastor with their families. A couple of younger women, a delegation of the harvesters, goes over to present the harvest crown to the landowner. \nHARVESTER: ...with our songs and our prayers We've gathered the rye and given that crown to your lordship. It is not big, it is not small, But pretty, nice and fine. Not with thistles or thorns is it made, but with pure grain. Had our lordship sowed more, The men would've scythed more And we girls gathered more. We girls have gathered the grain, Over mountains and valleys, Over thistles and thorn, Over the fields of our lordship. I wish our lordship a happy life, As many years as there's sand on the beach As many years as there are drops in the rain So much may our lordship be blessed. And as a reward to be of good cheer We'd like for our folks a barrel of beer, And if we could have a fried goose perchance Then we'll all be ready to dance. During the poem, the camera has shown all those we have met until now. They have all ( except for the Doctor, the farmer and his two eldest sons) come to the feast. While all the folks present LAUGH and SHOUT, the maid, with a clumsy curtsy, hands over the harvest crown to the Baron. The village band plays a fanfare. As soon as the hullabaloo has died down BARON(answering): My thanks to all of you. Thank you very much. You have worked well and the heavens were merciful, and now the barns are full. Therefore there's more than enough beer, and you won't starve today. He points to the open barn, where food and beer are waiting. In front of the barn are tables with long benches. BARON: Enjoy your meal!! Eat and drink as much as you wish. You deserve it. \nAgain the people YELL and CHEER. Then, the MUSIC starts and the feast is off and running. \n20. VEGETABLE GARDEN OF THE MANOR EXT/DAY The vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house. In the distance we hear the MUSIC from the feast. Franz, in working clothes, comes over, opens a gate in the fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbages and slices them all off with his scythe. The whole scene looks like a mass execution. \n21. ESTATE EXT/DAY The party is in full swing: people dance and shout, children run around, young men quarrel and show off in front of the young girls. Older women are stand around in groups, gossiping. Some farmers are gathered around the landowner \u00ad he is friendly with them, but we don't understand what they're talking about. His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place in this crowd. She's talking to the schoolteacher. BEATRIX: ...didn't you promise us a little chorale sung by your prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. SCHOOLTEACHER: You have to talk to the pastor, Baroness. We're still busy studying the choir pieces for the confirmation feast. BEATRIX (amused): But that's in spring, my dear. This is the start of autumn. SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles, embarrassed): I know, but unfortunately not all of our little singers are very musical. I'm sorry if... \n22. ESTATE. UNDER THE LIME TREE . EXT/DAY A quieter part of the estate. Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers of the landowner's family, a small table and a few chairs. Eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful bustle. Sitting beside her, turning her back to the manor, is Emma, the steward's wife who is breastfeeding her baby. The steward separates from a group of men and comes over to the two women. As he comes over, he shouts to them: \nSTEWARD: Well, you two \"mothers\"? Don't you want to be part of the festivities? Eva looks at the steward's wife, not knowing, how to react to the \"mother joke\". But the slightly naive wife of the steward is basically fond of any jokes her husband cracks. She turns halfway to him and says: EMMA: It's so nice here in the shade. In the meantime the steward has come over. He's smoking a pipe. STEWARD (in excellent mood): Well, our son seems to be enjoying that, right?! EMMA: Yes. STEWARD: I can imagine. Who wouldn't like that. EMMA (rebuking him gently): Georg! STEWARD (to Eva): What about you? Don't you get bored taking care of other people's children, with all the young lads over there? EVA (uneasy, with forced sweetness): No Sir, I love to be with the children. He gives his wife a short glance, then sits on a chair beside Eva: How old are you anyway? EVA: Eighteen, Sir. STEWARD: Eighteen! And you want me to believe you'd rather hold the Baroness's baby in your arms than your true love? EMMA (good-naturedly): Come on, Georg, leave her alone. STEWARD: I'm not doing her any harm. Can you get us something to eat, Emma? EVA (stands up, to Emma): If you mind the children for a moment, I'll get us something. STEWARD (stands up too): Don't worry, princess, I'm going. Not to panic. \n23. ESTATE. THE PATH LEADING TO THE VEGETABLE GARDEN. EXT/DAY A bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up in their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both wearing  their  white  ribbons,  the  pastor's  other \nchildren, Xenia, Rudolph as well as Hans, Liesl, Georg, Ferdinand and Sigi. They leave the manor and head toward the fields. As they pass by the vegetable garden, they notice the sliced off cabbages and stop. Some laugh at it, others are unsettled. Most of the children keep run on out into the open fields. \nThe Baroness, who doesn't think the symbolic character of the deed is funny at all, looks briefly at him and then back again at the cabbage cemetery. Suddenly, she turns away and leaves the scene headed toward the manor. She makes her way through the bystanders, who step aside to let her through. \n27. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DUSK The pastor works at his desk. Suddenly a KNOCK on the door PASTOR (looking up): Come in Florian comes hesitantly through the door. PASTOR: What do you want? FLORIAN (shy, almost frightened): I'd like to ask you something, Father. PASTOR: Yes? \nThe boy comes over to the desk, opens a few buttons of his shirt and then seizes something inside. In the open shirt we see the head of a little bird. PASTOR: So what? FLORIAN: I have found it. It's wounded. Short PAUSE. PASTOR: What do you want? FLORIAN (pleadingly): May I keep it? Short pause. The pastor is moved by the request of his youngest    son,  but   manages  to   hide   his emotion skillfully. PASTOR: How do you plan to do that? FLORIAN: We'll heal it. PASTOR (softly): And when it's healed? Florian looks at him with round eyes, he doesn't know what to answer. The pastor continues: Don't you think, you'll be attached to it then? Will you let it fly away? Florian thinks, then nods toward a cage behind the desk. FLORIAN: \"Pipsi\" also lives in a cage. The pastor looks at the cage shortly, hides a smile and turns to Florian again: \nPASTOR: Yes, but Pipsi grew up in captivity. (nodding at Florian's bird): This one is used to living in freedom. Florian doesn't know what to answer. So he merely looks at his father with pleading eyes. PASTOR (repeats): Will you set him free, as soon he's healed? Florian, looks down and nods with a heavy heart. PASTOR: Have you already asked Mother? Florian nods eagerly. PASTOR: And? What did she say? FLORIAN: She said, it was for Father to decide. PASTOR (smiling faintly): That's what she said? Florian nods eagerly and looks at his father with eyes that are pleading with expectation. PASTOR: You'll really to take care of it? That's a heavy responsibility. You know that, don't you? Sensing that his father is not quite against it, Florian nods eagerly. \nPASTOR: Well. You're its father and mother now. Florian nods yet more eagerly, if that's possible. The pastor finds it difficult not to smile: We'll have to find a cage for your patient. Florian can hardly believe it. He'd like to fling his arms around his father's neck, but doesn't dare. So he just keeps standing there, beaming. FLORIAN: Thanks, Father! \n28. TRACK TO THE FARM EXT/DUSK Leni comes along the track, excited. She`s almost running. She reaches the farm and disappears inside. \n29. FARM. ROOM. INT/DUSK The family is eating. They're in working clothes, since they didn't attend the Thanksgiving feast. Only Leni, who visibly just came into the room, is still wearing the clothes she wore at the feast. She's out of breath and very excited. The farmer looks very concerned. FARMER (to Franz): Is that true? FRANZ (hostile, keeps on eating): I don't know nothing. FARMER (threatening): Is \u00ad that - true?! FRANZ (looks at him, aggressively): Nothing is true! And even if it was true, so what?! Serves him right, that miser! FARMER (trying to control himself): Did you do it, or did you not do it? Franz doesn't answer and keeps on eating. LENI: It seems somebody saw you. For a moment Franz remains calm, then he bursts out: FRANZ (to Leni): So what? They should be glad that they still have their own heads.(to the farmer) And I want you to know this, Father: I'm proud of it! The father responds to this by slapping his face hard. Franz jumps up. FARMER (orders Franz without looking at him): Sit down! For a moment, we don't know how Franz will behave. Sitting on the corner bench, he's jammed between his \nfather and his brothers and sisters, who stare at the table, embarrassed. Only Paul, who sits opposite his brother, looks up at him. Franz finally sits down again. SILENCE. The farmer stares at his plate, tries to speak softly, which is obviously difficult for him, to judge by the sound of his voice. FARMER: What did you intend to do? As Franz doesn't answer, he looks up, right into Franz's face, who avoids his father's eyes. FARMER: Well? FARMER: Tell me. Franz keeps on glaring straight ahead. The farmer adopts a gentler tone. Come on. Tell me: FRANZ (who   can   hardly   speak):   You   know   why, Father. FARMER (after a pause): Because of your mother? Because you feel they're responsible for her death? Is that it? What do you think? That I'm not man enough to settle this? It's that what you think? Franz keeps on glaring, remaining silent. The father tries to stay calm, staring straight ahead. He takes a spoon and eats twice from the milk soup. He puts down the spoon, and looks at Franz again. \nDid you ever think of what your behavior can mean for the whole family? If Leni loses her job, which enables us to keep our heads above water for the whole year? What if we can't work there anymore during the summer? \nWe all know that the people responsible for the terrible injuries suffered by my son, and those suffered by the doctor are sitting here among us, in this room. I won't tolerate that crimes of this nature go unpunished. I don't wish something similar to happen to any of your children. That's why I call upon you all to help me find the culprit or the culprits. Ask questions, keep your ears open, be watchful. If we fail to find out the truth, the peace within our community will be gone. Thank you, pastor. \nThe pastor says a few last words which we don't grasp, that the narrator's voice drowns out. The people file out of the church, quietly and slowly, but talking worriedly to each other. \nNARRATOR: The landowner's speech frightened the people. Most knew about the incident at the Thanksgiving feast. But the majority didn't know exactly what had happened, and in the end they didn't care. The Baron was not really popular among the people, but he was respected as a powerful social figure, as well as the employer of nearly the whole village. \n34. IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH EXT/DAY BACK TO THE SCENE. The people are leaving the church, groups are forming. As the farmer Felder and his children come out, they're shunned. Gauntlet down the village street. The CAMERA follows. NARRATOR: ...His threat about loosing the peace of the community couldn't mean anything good. At the same time the mysterious character of what were obviously criminal deeds fed the mistrust of the farmers, deeply rooted since time immemorial. \n35. SCHOOL. INT/NIGHT The empty classroom. On the harmonium: a petroleum lamp. The schoolteacher is PLAYING. After a while, someone knocks at the door. The schoolteacher stops. SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised): Come in! \nThe door opens hesitantly. In the dark: Eva (hardly recognizable because she's so far from the lamp). \nSCHOOLTEACHER (surprised and glad): Eva! EVA (hardly understandable): May I come in? The Schoolteacher stands up, goes toward and, laughing with surprise, says to her. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: What a question. Of course. Come in. What happened. \nEva enters the room and closes the door behind her. She's carrying a suitcase. Shyly she looks around and doesn't say a word. \nEVA (after a pause, serious again): Who could have done such things? \nSCHOOLTEACHER: What? \nEVA: To beat a child that way. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. \nLong PAUSE. Then she says softly: \nEVA: Can I stay here tonight?         Don't send me away, sir, please. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: How can you think something like that? \nEVA: I'll just wait for the daylight to come. Here in the classroom. Then I'll leave. \nSuddenly she starts to cry again: \nPAUSE. Then the schoolteacher stands up and says: \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Come here, I'll play something for you. If you'd like that. \nShe thinks for a moment, then she nods eagerly. She follows him, as he goes and settles in front of the harmonium. She sits on a bench nearby. He starts to PLAY. \n36. FARM. PIGSTY. INT/EXT/DAY The farmer and Paul are cleaning the pigsty which is not very big. The pigs grunt excitedly because of the disturbance. Suddenly, Franz enters. FRANZ: Good morning, Father. The farmer looks up, keeps on working as if nobody had come in. Paul greets Franz with a nod, remaining silent. After a while, they've done their work. Ignoring Franz, the farmer goes outside. Franz, who has stepped aside to let his father by, says to him as he goes out: FRANZ: I'm back again. They set me free. At this, the farmer stops and turns around. He looks Franz right into the eyes: FARMER: I can see that. So what? Franz bows his head. Paul, who has followed his father, out of the pigsty, glances surreptitiously at his brother. The farmer goes over to the fountain and washes himself. Franz follows him slowly and stops beside his father, who keeps ignoring him. After a while \nFRANZ says (softly): Can't you forgive me, Father? The farmer stops washing and turns to Franz: FARMER: What do you want me to forgive for? That the estate won't give me any work now? That Leni has been fired in disgrace? That your brothers and sisters soon won't have anything to eat. Is that what you mean? Or is it something else? \n37. COUNTRY ROAD AND DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY The CAMERA follows the carriage in which are Eva and the schoolteacher. NARRATOR: The next day, after school, I went to the estate to inquire about Sigi's health and to intercede for Eva's reinstatement. We were told the Baroness had left that morning with her children. Reluctantly, the steward lent me a carriage to take Eva home. An open carriage with the Doctor inside comes from the opposite direction. The passengers of the two carriages greet each other. The CAMERA follows the Doctor and looses Eva and the schoolteacher. The doctor has one arm in a sling. The Doctor's carriage ends up turning into his property. The driver helps the doctor get out. Xenia comes running out of the house and greets her father. The driver unloads the luggage. The doctor and Xenia go into the house. \nJust as we were leaving the village, we met the doctor. A few days after the Thanksgiving feast, Rudolph, his four year old son, had suddenly disappeared. Of course, everybody was terribly upset in view of all the previous occurrences. Finally, he was found walking down the road, scantily dressed for a trip, headed eagerly toward the town. When he was asked where he was going, he said he wanted to visit his father. Seems he fought tooth and nail against being taken home. Somebody must have told this to the Doctor. Since he was scheduled to be released from medical care anyway, he had prematurely put an end to his stay at the hospital. \n38. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAY BACK TO THE SCENE. STAIRWELL. DOCTOR (calls several times): Rudi? He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia. Xenia shrugs her shoulders, clueless: \nXENIA: He was in the living room a short time ago. \nThe doctor turns to her. She nods toward the house. The doctor follows her look. Indeed Rudolph, who from here looks even smaller than he really is, has stepped gingerly out of the door. Unsure and undecided, torn between defiance and longing, he's kept one hand on the door handle that he can barely reach. \n40. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/NIGHT The pastor cleans the cage of the small bird behind the desk and feeds the animal. As he does it, he talks to \nMartin, who, the white ribbon still tied around his upper arm, stands in front of the desk. PASTOR: Your mother and I are deeply worried about you. Think about it. Are you sleeping badly? Are you overtired? MARTIN   (as   if   he   didn't   understand   the question): No. PASTOR: Do you have problems in school that I don't know? MARTIN (as above): No, Father. The pastor turns shortly around to his son, looks at him, then turns again to the bird. \nPASTOR: You probably don't understand why we worry. It comes from a sad experience I want to tell you briefly about: As you know, I'm also acting as pastor for the communities of Birkenbrunn and Hebern. In the latter place, some years ago, a mother came to see me. She had noticed that her son, who was about the same age as you, and had the same symptoms that you've been showing for some time. Although until then the boy had been healthy and active,   suddenly   he  showed   a   noticeable weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes, seemed depressed and joyless. The boy had also changed emotionally: before he had been funny, frank, almost naughty, but now he became withdrawn. He tried not to look his parents in the eye, and was caught telling small and even big lies. \nThe pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding, and now sits down behind his desk, Martin opposite him: That lasted approximately half a year. Then everything went very fast: he lost his appetite, couldn't sleep any more, his whole face took on the brownish color of the rings under his eyes, his hands began to shake, his memory stated to fail him, he was covered with numerous small pustules, first on his face, then on his whole body and finally he died. The body, which I blessed, looked like the body of an old man. The pastor watches Martin: PASTOR: Do you understand now why I'm worried? Martin reacts with a timid nod of his head. PASTOR: So, according to you: what caused these changes that led to the miserable end of this boy? MARTIN (hardly able to speak): I don't know. \nPASTOR: I think you know well. Martin doesn't know what to say, he looks down. The pastor watches him for a long moment, then he gets up, walks around the desk and sits down on its edge, in front of the boy, so that their heads are facing each other. \nWon't you tell me? No? Then I'll tell you what the cause was: The boy had learned from someone, who had harmed the finest nerves of his body, in the area where God's will has erected sacred barriers. The boy imitated this action. He couldn't stop doing it, so that at the end he destroyed all the nerves in his body, and so much that he died of it. \nMartin seems very affected. He has bowed his head, swallows several times, and hardly dares to breath. Look at me, Martin. Martin looks up fearfully, then immediately looks away again. I just want to help you. I love you with all my heart. Look at me. Martin looks his father in the eyes. Be sincere, Martin. Why did you blush and become so nervous when I told you the story of the poor boy. MARTIN: Blushed? I don't know... I felt sorry for him. PASTOR: Is that all? No, Martin, there has to be another reason. It's written on your face. Be sincere, Martin. Sincerity brings you closer to God, our beloved Father, and to all human beings. MARTIN (starts to cry): Oh, my God! He cries in a such pitiful way that even the pastor has tears in his eyes. He embraces the boy. The latter seizes the hand of his father and kisses it intensely. PASTOR: Well, Martin, why are you crying? Shall I spare you that confession? You too have done what that wretched boy did, haven't you? MARTIN (crying): Oh my God! Yes. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. \n41. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT/NIGHT Intercourse between the midwife and the doctor. She holds on to the sideboard, as he penetrates her from behind. Both are fully dressed, she has just lifted her skirt. When he is ready, she turns around and puts her arms around him. He lets her do it, with a patronizing smile and pulls gently away from her. DOCTOR: Careful, my arm. She tries to hide her frustration, sits down again with him at the table, on which are the leftovers of their meal. With a little ironic smile, the doctor raises his glass to her. She takes her glass and clinks it with his. She drinks. An embarrassed silence follows. Finally, she says MIDWIFE: It's great that you're back. It was about time. DOCTOR: You can say that. Yes. PAUSE. MIDWIFE: It was   difficult    with    the    children, without you. DOCTOR: I know. MIDWIFE: He doesn't like me. DOCTOR: Who? MIDWIFE: Rudi. DOCTOR (after a pause): He's at a difficult age. MIDWIFE: Actually not. PAUSE. Then: They're always at a difficult age. DOCTOR (more to himself, with a faint smile): Yes. LONG PAUSE. MIDWIFE: You didn't miss me. DOCTOR: Come on. What are you saying?! MIDWIFE: Nothing. I said it because it's the truth. PAUSE. DOCTOR: There's   nothing   like   a   nice    dose   of self-hate. MIDWIFE: What? DOCTOR: Nothing. Forget it. \n45. SNOW-COVERED COUNTRY ROAD EXT/DAY The schoolteacher, a rucksack on his back, walks through the snow which is only furrowed by some carriage tracks. \nNARRATOR: In mid-December, I finally got a letter from Eva. Her father had found her a new job in the district capital, which she would start at the beginning of the New Year. Since that night, where she had come looking for shelter in the school and we had tried to tell each other the story of our short lives until the wee hours of the morning, I could no longer banish from my thoughts her pale face, her shy but frank personality and her shining hair red. The school holidays lasted until the morning after New Year's Day, but already the second day after Christmas \u00ad the weather was cold but sunny \u00ad I went on my way to Obersdorf in order to visit Eva and her parents. \n46. THE HORSE-TRADER'S LIVING-ROOM INT/DAY A lower middle-class room. The schoolteacher sits in front of Eva and her siblings, 6 children between 14 and 6, mostly red-haired like Eva. Embarrassed silence. The younger children whisper and giggle. The conversation is slow. After a long pause EVA says: And Sigi? SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. The Baroness isn't back yet. EVA: And the Baron? SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): We hardly see him. He talks to nobody. I don't know. Some say they've gone to the south. To Italy. EVA: To Italy? Really. PAUSE.   The   children    giggle,   amused   over    the embarrassment of the two people. The schoolteacher and Eva look at each other, but Eva soon averts her eyes. SCHOOLTEACHER: They now want to tear down the sawmill for good. That's what the steward says. Because it isn't worthwhile to... At that moment the door opens and Eva's parents come in. Obviously, the mother went to fetch the father. She is plump, in her late forties and only wears a woolen shawl over her shoulders. The father wears a hat and overcoat. He's a sturdy man in his early fifties, of peasant stock. He probably came straight from a tavern, and appears to be slightly drunk. The schoolteacher, Eva and the children stand up. The schoolteacher bows deeply: SCHOOLTEACHER: Good morning. FATHER: Good morning, young man. They shake hands. FATHER: Please be seated. We're not very formal here. With a short movement of his hand the father invites him to sit down. FATHER (to the children): Scram! The children, rather sheepish since the arrival of their father, leave the room. The father unbuttons his over coat, throws the hat on the sofa and sits down. The mother has removed her shawl and asks the schoolteacher: MOTHER: Would you like something to drink? SCHOOLTEACHER: No, thank you. Very kind. MOTHER: Really? SCHOOLTEACHER: Really. Thank you very much. \nThe father sits      down beside Eva and looks at the schoolteacher. Eva    appears to be awkward, and stares at the table in front   of her. FATHER: So   you're a schoolteacher. SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes. FATHER: Can you afford to have a wife? Short embarrassed PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER: My father works as a tailor in Grundbach. I have an apprentice's diploma. So I earn quite a bit on the side FATHER: You should have taken over your father's business, that would have been smarter. PAUSE. Well. And why are you so focused on that girl? She's almost still a child. You could almost be her father. SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): I'm thirty-one. FATHER (grinning): Well, you can still handle what matters. MOTHER (embarrassed): Father! Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look. FATHER: Let's be serious: do you know whether she's willing to get married. She's still a child. She hasn't seen anything of the world. To Eva: Say something. Do you want him? Eva wishes the earth would engulf her. FATHER: Come on. Don't make such a fuss. He walked all the way over through the fresh snow. MOTHER: Why don't you leave her alone.         Of course, she wants him. Can't you feel that?! FATHER: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut! Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tears out of shame. The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovingly at the father. The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ran out. He'd rather follow her, but has to remain polite toward the father. The father says calmly: \nFATHER: Just sit down. That's how women are. A bit hysterical, the whole lot of them. Listen. I'm not a big talker. On one hand, it suits me for the girl to leave the house. We have a lot of mouths to feed, as you can see. \nOn the other hand, it's all moving a bit too fast for me. I don't know you. It's not that I don't like you, but I need to get some information about you first. Besides, the town hairdresser has agreed to take her on as an apprentice. That way she'll get to meet people and she can make up he mind whether she really wants this or not. And if in a year's time she has stuck to this idea, we can l talk about it again. And you can make up your mind too, all right? SCHOOLTEACHER: I actually thought I... FATHER (interrupts him): I know, I know. But it's either that or nothing. You get it? SCHOOLTEACHER (after a short pause) steps back: If you insist... FATHER: Yes, I do. He holds out his hand to the schoolteacher, who accepts it after a brief hesitation. FATHER: That's it. I'm pleased. Well, business is waiting. Even on holidays. I'll send the girl back in so that you can say good-bye. A year goes by fast. The world won't collapse. And during your holidays you can come and visit her. Good-bye. He leaves the room. The schoolteacher is thrown off balance by all this. He stands up and takes a few steps. He sits down again and thinks. Finally, the door opens and Eva enters. She doesn't really know what to do. Neither does the schoolteacher. As she comes in he stands up again. Finally Eva goes over to the table and sits down. The schoolteacher also sits down. They exchange a short glance and an equally brief smile. PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father tell...? EVA: Yes. PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with you? PAUSE. EVA: Is that all right with you, sir? SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): Don't be so formal with me. Eva looks up. Their eyes meet. Then she takes his hand in her hand. They remain seated without saying a word. \n47. RECTORY. THE BOYS' BEDROOM. INT/NIGHT It is dark. Martin, Anton and Florian, whom we don't recognize at first glance, are lying in their beds. Through the window, a red glow, slowly getting stronger. Suddenly MARTIN'S VOICE: Toni! Are you awake? Toni!! ANTON'S VOICE (half asleep): What is it? MARTIN VOICE: Look. ANTON'S VOICE: What's happening? MARTIN VOICE: Look! Look what's happening out there!! Now, Anton sits up slowly, rubs his eyes. ANTON'S VOICE: My God, what do you want? MARTIN VOICE: Over there!! Have a look out of the window!! Anton turns to the window and looks at the red glow. Then he slips out of the bed and goes to the window. Suddenly, he is wide-awake: ANTON: Something is burning! Over there at the estate! MARTIN: Untie me! Anton turns around to Martin, hesitates. MARTIN: Come on, untie me! Anton doesn't really know what to do. He turns to the window again, then again to Martin. The latter screams angrily: I told you to untie me!! ANTON: I don't know... MARTIN: I'll beat you black and blue, if you don't untie me! The loud dispute has now also awakened Florian, who says in a drowsy voice: FLORIAN: What's happening? Why can't you be quiet. MARTIN: Flori, come over and untie me! FLORIAN: What's going on? MARTIN (yells): Untie me, dammit!! You idiots! It's burning!! \nFLORIAN: It's burning? Florian gets up himself and patters to the window. He looks out and then says, amazed and enthusiastic: It's burning! MARTIN (imitates him angrily): OK, it's burning! Now untie me, godammit! Florian looks at Anton with questioning eyes and then says to Martin: FLORIAN: But Father hasn't allowed it... Reverse angle POV of the two boys at the window toward Martin, who we see for the first from the front. His wrists are tied to the left and the right side of the bed. Trying sit up, he pulls furiously at his ties. MARTIN (furious): But if there's an emergency, you idiot. Somebody must warn them! (he yells loudly: Faaaather!! Mooooother!! Father! Frightened by his screams, Anton now goes over to him and undoes his ties. ANTON: Stop shouting. I'll untie you. FLORIAN: Shall I call Mother? We already hear hurried STEPS in the corridor. The door opens and the mother enters, dressed in a nightgown. MOTHER: What's going on here? Martin has just been untied. MARTIN: It's burning! MOTHER: I know. Your father has already gone. In the door, the girls appear after their mother. They have left their room attracted by the noise. The mother turns to them: MOTHER: What are you doing here? (to everyone): You all go to bed now. It's nothing. There's a fire on the estate. You don't need to be afraid. Go to bed and sleep. Come on, Marie, take your sisters with you and go to your room. Otherwise you'll catch a cold. The girls disappear again. The mother turns to Martin: Why did you make so much noise? You woke us all up! Martin doesn't know what to answer. Then he says apologetically: MARTIN: I thought it was dangerous. ANTON (apologizing): I had to untie his hands. MOTHER (calming them down): Now, everything's all right again. Tomorrow, Father will tell you what happened with the fire. All right? Now you \nall got back to bed. I'll wait till you're back in bed. It's freezing cold outside. The three boys go back to bed. But first Anton ties up Martin's hands again. He pulls a blanket over his brother. Then they all disappear under their blankets. \nMIDWIFE: You must be very unhappy to be so mean. DOCTOR: Oh God! Please, not that routine! MIDWIFE: I know that I'm not much to look at. My bad breath comes from my stomach, you know that very well. But it didn't bother you in the past when we got together. I already had my ulcer when your wife was still alive. DOCTOR: Please spare me these sordid details. But let me reassure you: it has always disgusted me. I accepted it, because I wanted to ease my pain after Erika's death and I didn't care with whom. I could have screwed a cow. Whores are unfortunately too far from here and regrettably once every two months isn't enough for me, even though I'm getting older. So skip your damn martyrdom routine and get out. \nPAUSE. MIDWIFE (keeps on speaking softly): Why did this only occur to you now? DOCTOR: According to you: when should it have occurred to me? At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome you were. One grows sentimental when one's in pain. PAUSE. DOCTOR (tired): Get out. Why don't you get out. Don't you have any pride? MIDWIFE (equally tired): There's no room for any with you. DOCTOR: That's true. MIDWIFE: Aren't    you   afraid   that   I   might   do something silly? DOCTOR (laughs with disdain): Go ahead. At least that would surprise me. But be careful: it might be painful. MIDWIFE: I know. I'm ridiculous. You wouldn't care anyway. DOCTOR: Well... She looks at him. \nMIDWIFE: Why do you despise me? For helping to raise the boy? For watching you fingering your little daughter and not saying a word? \nThe doctor goes over and slaps her. Tears start to run down her face, but after a short pause she keeps on speaking, \"unmoved\": \nFor helping you to deceive yourself? For listening to you claim how unique your love for Erika was, though the whole village knew, how badly you treated her? For loving you, although I know you can't stand being loved? \nThe doctor snorts with disdain. \nDOCTOR: That's it. Now leave me alone. I've got work to do. \nShe gets up and makes room for him. He sits down at the desk and \"works\". She looks down at him: \nMIDWIFE: You can't afford to get rid of me. Who would do the dirty work for you, who would help you with the children, and here in you practice? You're not speaking seriously. You just want to see how far you can go, don't you: will she still put up with it or can I drag her even lower through the mud? \nA maid hurries out of the house with reinforcements, the Baroness is being welcomed respectfully and the luggage is being unloaded. The nurse gives instructions in Italian, which leads to some confusion. Then the nanny talks to Sigi who translates to the servants, laughing. Besides, the boy looks transformed: instead of his former pale skin color, his face now has a nice tan, his fair hair has been further bleached by the sun, he has grown taller and looks altogether stronger and happier. The Baroness too seems more relaxed and restored. She and Sigi are about to go straight into the house when we hear, coming from the other side of the courtyard FERDINAND'S VOICE: Sigi! Sigi turns around. Ferdinand has seen him from the window and called. Sigi waves back: SIGI: Hi, Ferdinand! FERDINAND: Wait! I'm coming down! Sigi wants to run over to the steward's house. \nBARONESS:   Stay   here,   Sigi,   you   can   see   him later. NURSE (in Italian): Let him go, Signora! He's so happy to be home again. BARONESS (muses, then smiles): All right, you can go. But don't stay too long. Sigi hurries off. The Baroness and the nurse look at each other in agreement. The Baroness smiles faintly. Then they go through the door into the house. For a moment we only see the open door with the dark stairwell behind it. Then we hear the STEPS of the Baron, first on the gravel in the yard. Then Baron comes into frame, and goes through the door into the house. He vanishes into the darkness of the stairwell. From there we hear his voice: BARON (calling): Beatrix? Beatrix, where are you? The nurse comes out after a while again NURSE (calls in Italian): Sigi. Don't you want to come say hello to your father? But Sigi is talking intensely to Ferdinand on the other side of the courtyard and doesn't answer. \n56. SCHOOL. INT/DAY CLASSROOMS. The children are going wild. Brawling, sponge and chalk are flying through the air. Some are packing up their belongings, preparing to leave the classroom. In short, the way children behave once the lesson is over. Marie stands at the classroom door. She watches her classmates. The she looks through the door into the CORRIDOR. It's empty. She comes back to the CLASSROOM, but stays at the door so that she can still keep an eye on the corridor. Apparently, she has been posted there as a lookout to warn against the possible arrival of a teacher. The shouting, laughter and brawling goes on. Suddenly, Marie sees the schoolteacher in the CORRIDOR with her father. The two are having an animated conversation. Marie bursts into the CLASSROOM and closes the door to muffle the noise, then she shouts to her classmates: MARIE: Watch out, he's coming! But with all the shouting and laughter, her voice isn't heard by all of the pupils. The noise dies down, some of them stop misbehaving. Somebody picks up the sponge, and \nthe blackboard is quickly cleaned up of the traces of the fight. But a small group who had started to chase each other around, doesn't hear and keeps at it. Marie shouts to them again, this time louder: Be quiet! For God's sake! Be quiet!! But as the wild chase goes on and some over-exited children even make fun of her, and she yells at the top of her voice: QUIET!!!! At that moment, the door opens and the pastor comes in with the schoolteacher. Almost instantly, the room becomes QUIET. Without saying a word, the pastor goes over to Marie, grabs her by the ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the stove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall. The pupils remain silent, embarrassed. While the pastor goes back to the black board, putting his briefcase on the desk without saying a word, the schoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for the lack of discipline of his classroom, says: SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on here? Why are you still here? You know that there's a confirmation class now! Get out! The children disappear quickly. To the first child who tries to sneak out the schoolteacher says: How about saying good-bye? Immediately all the CHILDREN rushing out say: Good-bye, Sir! Good-bye, Pastor! Finally, all the children have left the classroom, except eight candidates for confirmation, among them Paul, Xenia and Marie with her face still turned to the wall. The schoolteacher turns to the pastor: SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm sorry, Pastor. It won't happen again. The pastor answers with a reserved nod. In an icy silence, he has waited for the all the younger pupils to leave. As the schoolteacher notices that there will be no further reaction from the pastor, he bows slightly to him and says: Good-bye, Pastor. PASTOR: Good-bye. The schoolteacher leaves the room. The pastor turns to the candidates for confirmation: Let us pray. They say the LORD'S PRAYER together. Then the pastor says: Sit down. \nThe students sit down. Marie keeps standing facing the wall. The pastor stops too. After a while he begins to talk. This is a very sad day for me. In a few weeks, we all want to celebrate the confirmation feast together. For many months I have tried to bring God's word closer to you, and to make responsible human beings out of you in His spirit. And what do I face today? A horde of yelling monkeys,   without  any   discipline   or   human dignity, as childish as the seven-year olds, with whom you're sharing this classroom. But what makes me even sadder is the fact that my own daughter is playing the leading role in this pitiful display. Last year I bound a white ribbon in her hair. Well, you all know that white is the color of innocence. The ribbon was meant to help Marie to avoid sin, selfishness, envy, indecency, lies and sloth. Well, at the start of the year, I was naive enough to believe, that now, in the year of her confirmation, she'd become mature enough, and that she wouldn't need that ribbon any more I believed that she felt responsible, being the daughter of the spiritual leader of a Christian communi... \nMarie, who all this time has been waiting beside the stove, faints and collapses to the floor. \n57. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHT STAIRWELL. The only light comes in from the living room. Rudolph comes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt. RUDOLPH (softly): Xeni? He goes into the LIVING ROOM. It's empty. RUDOLPH (as above, anxiously): Xeni? Where are you? He goes into the KITCHEN. It's also empty. Rudolph is desperate. He starts to cry. Finally, he goes back to the STAIRWELL and goes up the stairs to his room. On the stairway, he notices light coming from under the door of the practice. He goes back down the stairs down again and opens the door of the PRACTICE. In the bright light, sitting in front of each other, are the doctor and Xenia. The doctor has his back to Rudolph, so that we see Xenia's face first. She sits on \nthe visitor's chair. He has placed his chair in front of hers, and his legs are closed around her legs. She's crying. The situation is ambiguous, we don't know what has happened. The noise at the door startles Xenia, she looks at Rudolph: XENIA (startled, her face tearstained): Rudi?! The doctor spins around, and looks stunned to his young son. Both look as if they have been caught red-handed. XENIA: What are you doing here? Why aren't you in bed? Rudolph doesn't really know, what to think of all this, but   being    the  good   child   he   is,  he   answers automatically: RUDOLPH: I can't get to sleep. XENIA: That's why you're wandering around like a ghost in the middle of the night? RUDOLPH: I woke up and you weren't there. Short PAUSE. Xenia wipes the tears from her face. XENIA (trying to smile): Dad has pierced      my earlobes. RUDOLPH: Does it hurt? XENIA: Yes, a bit. RUDOLPH: That's why you're crying? XENIA (tries to smile): I'm not crying any more. DOCTOR (trying to joke): Beauty has to suffer. That's what they say. At least for girls... He gets up and goes, still seen from behind, to a closet, and puts something into it that we can't recognize. He's straightens his clothes. Then he goes over to Rudolph: DOCTOR: Now go to bed again. You too, Xeni. XENIA: Yes. As Rudolph hesitates and looks at her dubiously, she explains, almost eagerly: I haven't worn earrings for a long time, that's why my earlobes grew back again. To show him, she grasps one of her ears. For Whitsun feast, when we all want to look our best make ourselves look beautiful, I'm getting new earrings. The ones that Mom had, with garnets... \nRudolph looks at her. He doesn't think she's telling the truth. \nLIESL,(defiantly, as he's not believing her): Because he's jealous. SCHOOLTEACHER: And because you believe that, you dreamt it. It doesn't mean anything at all. It's just a coincidence. LIESL (keeping her head bowed): All right. \nThe schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Look at me. \nShe looks at him reluctantly, maintaining her defiant reserve. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Don't tell such stories to anybody! You obviously don't realize the harm you can do with it. Again she looks down at the floor. You didn't tell the story         to   your   parents, didn't you? She shakes her head. All right then. Forget it quickly.   I   shall    forget     it,   too. Promise? As she doesn't answer, he repeats: Promise? \nShe nods almost imperceptibly. \nGood. Now can I have my handkerchief back... \nHe holds his hand out to her. Astonished she looks at the handkerchief in her hands. She had forgotten it completely, and gives it back the schoolteacher. Thank you. He pockets the handkerchief. Now, we both have a secret. And you promise me that it will remain a secret between us. All right? She nods reluctantly. He insists, seeks her gaze: Yes?! LIESL (reluctantly): Yes. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well. All right then. You don't have to worry. Nothing will happen to Hansi. (smiling): Nobody is jealous of him. \nShe glances at him to see whether he's making fun of her. He looks at her seriously and gives her a nod that demands an answer. She nods briefly. But it isn't clear whether she just does it to please him. Dreams don't come true. That only happens in fairy-tales. Forget all about it. He looks at her, as she stands there, head bowed. Finally he smiles and tries to \"crack a joke\" to make the matter less serious: Do you know what they did to little girls who predicted the future in ancient times? They burned them at the stake as witches. She looks up at him, round-eyed. \nAccept and drink! That is the blood of the new will, spilled for you so that your sins         will   be forgiven. \nHe wipes the cup, where Marie's mouth drank \u00ad as he does after each child - and goes on to the next one, repeating the rite... \n63. FOREST EXT/NIGHT Distant VOICES. At first incomprehensible. Gradually we understand them better: VOICES: Hansi? Where are you? Give us a sign! Hansi, where are you? Here and there silhouettes appear in the half-light. Some carry lanterns, other torches. It takes some time before they get nearer and become recognizable: they're men and women from the village. After a while MAN'S VOICE(calling): Over here. He's here. We follow those running over: Bound to a tree is a small boy. His whole head is wrapped up in rags. A small slit has been left open so the nose can breathe. He MOANS. \nA paper has been tied around his neck with a white ribbon. The people hurry toward the child, free the child of its fetters. The child slumps down, his head is unwrapped, covered in blood: it's the mongoloid son of the midwife. Astonished, somebody reads the words written in block letters on the paper): \nFOR I THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD, VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH GENERATION OF THOSE WHO HATE ME. \n64. SCHOOL. INT/DAY CORRIDOR. Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple of other children are waiting at the classroom door. They remain silent. They're listening. \nNARRATOR:   After    this   intricate  atrocity committed on the retarded boy, even the Baron was finally convinced that it would be more intelligent to call upon the professional help of the county's police force. So a few days later a couple of plainclothes policemen arrived and, after a visit to the several of the crime scenes, started to ask in various homes if anyone had noticed anything suspicious. \nCLASSROOM \nThe two detectives question Liesl in the presence of the schoolteacher and become more and more aggressive. Liesl ends up crying. \nEven if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be before his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three years older than him, is much stronger: with the weight of his whole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backward into the shallow water of the brook, and takes his whistle away. The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the stream isn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowing water. Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents him from helping him, as it means admitting his own unjust behavior. For a moment he hesitates, a helpless and defiant grin on his face. But Ferdinand has already jumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes his head to fully come to his senses. Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on the bank, still holding the whistle in his hand. Then Georg points his finger at him, and says furiously and guiltily. GEORG (threatening): If you rat on me, you'll be sorry! \n67. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DAY The pastor sits at his desk, working. A KNOCK is heard. PASTOR: Come in! Florian comes in, hesitantly. In his hand, he carries a birdcage (we've already seen it in Scene 49 in the boy's bedroom at night). In the cage is the bird that Florian had found on Thanksgiving day, and who has recovered in the meantime. PASTOR: Yes? The boy looks embarrassed. He glances at his father, then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully on his father's desk. As Florian approaches, the pastor looked on, amazed. After putting down the cage, Florian steps back a little, then stops, his head slightly bowed. PASTOR (not really understanding): What is it? What do you want? FLORIAN (softly): For Pipsi. (PAUSE. Then even more softly): Because Father is sad. The pastor looks at him, doesn't know how to react. Then,   with  a   hoarse   voice  and  trying to  look indifferent, he says: PASTOR: Thank you. \nFLORIAN (as apprehensive in front of his father's perceptible emotion): You're welcome, Father. For a moment, neither of them knows what to do. Then the boy leaves the room. The pastor follows him with his eyes. Then, he sits down. He tries to keep his composure, but in the end he bursts into tears. He sobs haltingly, trying hard not let it be heard. \n68.THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/EXT/DAY \nTHE CHILDREN'S ROOM. Georg stands at the window and looks down at the \nCOURTYARD \nComing from   the   manor,   the   steward   is   walking   over briskly. \nTHE CHILDREN'S ROOM. Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table, doing his homework. We hear the FRONT DOOR opening downstairs, then the father's hasty STEPS on the stairs. Finally, the father appears in the door. He's out of breath, furious, and tries to speak quietly STEWARD: Give me that whistle! Georg looks at his father, \"not understanding\". GEORG: I beg your pardon? STEWARD (forcedly, with threatening calm): Give me that whistle! GEORG: What whistle? At this, the steward pounces on the boy and smacks him so hard that he falls out of his chair. Give it to me! GEORG (on the ground): What whistle? The steward yanks him up and shoves him against the wall. Georg stumbles over the table which is standing in the way, and lies back on the table top, trying to protect his face with his hands. STEWARD: Give away it to me, or I'll kill you. GEORG (half moaning): I have no whistle. The steward lets go of him and starts to beat                him furiously. \nGEORG (screaming): Ouch! ...Ouch!! STEWARD (beat): You bastard, you wretch! GEORG (scream): Ouch! Ouch! !! Please don't At that moment, attracted by the noise, Emma, the mother, appears: EMMA: For God's sake, Georg, what are you doing? What has the boy done? The mother's arrival has snapped the father out of his blind rage. He glances at her, then turns to the boy again, breathless with excitement, but forcing himself to be calm: STEWARD: For the last time: give it to me! GEORG (almost crying with pain): But I don't know what you mean, Father. The mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to the other, then turns pleadingly to her husband: EMMA: What's going on? What are you talking about? STEWARD (to Georg): You know exactly what I mean. Again the mother looks from one to the other, trying to save the situation: EMMA: But if he says so! Georg! What's going on? The steward turns to her, annoyed by her insistence, looks at her for a long moment, then at Georg again and turns on his heels and leaves the room. \nBARON: They've shot the heir to the throne of Austria. In Sarajevo. \n70. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAY The same setting as in Scene 57. The countryside in all its summer splendor. \nNARRATOR: The news spread around the village like wildfire. What would the consequences be? The first person who spoke the word WAR, was severely contradicted. But once it had been uttered, it remained at the center of all our thoughts in a curiously stubborn way. I wanted to go to the town as quickly as possible, in order to discuss it with Eva, what we should do if war broke out. Perhaps her father would now agree to an earlier marriage. I asked the Baroness for the bicycle, with which Eva had visited her parents some time ago. The following weekend I planned use it to ride to town and see her. \n71. ESTATE EXT/DAY The schoolteacher is pushing the bicycle out of the manor house. He says good-bye to a maid, who closes the door behind him. Some SHOUTING o.s. makes him look toward the steward's house: the steward comes out with the midwife, and it looks like he's throwing her out with a flood of angry insults. NARRATOR: When I went to the estate on Friday evening to pick up the bicycle, so I could take it with me to the school, and get going early, as the trip was a quite long one, I witnessed a strange confrontation: STEWARD: ...completely mad! Go if you want. He'll throw you out on your ear. Slandering other people and creating trouble. That's all we need now! Get out and never come back again! This is unbelievable! Go ahead, do whatever you think you have to do! You're hysterical! MIDWIFE (simultaneously): ...I'll go to the Baron. We'll see what he says. You won't silence me. Who do you think you are?! You'll see. I'll \ntell him that you tried to prevent me from giving the police a statement. Angrily the steward slams the door behind him. At first the midwife doesn't know what to do. Finally she turns away from the door and starts to cross the yard. There, she sees the schoolteacher. She comes over to him. SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon, Mrs. Wagner. What's happening? MIDWIFE (very excited): Good afternoon. Can I borrow your bicycle? SCHOOLTEACHER: It's not mine. MIDWIFE: Could I borrow it just the same? SCHOOLTEACHER: I just borrowed it myself.      I going to ride to town, to see my fianc\u00e9e.. MIDWIFE: Please! Lend it to me! SCHOOLTEACHER: Why do you need it? Where do you want to go? MIDWIFE: I must go to town. SCHOOLTEACHER: What for? MIDWIFE: I asked the steward for a carriage, but that stubborn fool won't agree to anything. PAUSE. Please! Lend me the bicycle. SCHOOLTEACHER: Why? What is going on? After hesitating a while MIDWIFE: I have to go to the police in town. I now know who committed all these crimes. SCHOOLTEACHER (flabbergasted): Who? MIDWIFE: Will you let me have the bicycle? SCHOOLTEACHER: Why don't you tell me? MIDWIFE: From now on I shall only talk to the police. I won't let them insult me (turning to the steward's house): As you just saw. SCHOOLTEACHER: Can't the doctor can lend you his horse? MIDWIFE: I don't know how to ride. The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because he still doesn't understand what it's all about, but she doesn't respond, and says: \nMIDWIFE: Please! Believe me! (She hesitates and adds, now quietly and imploringly): My son told me who did it to him. He may loose his eyesight. Please, you let me have the bicycle! \nThe schoolteacher looks at her. The midwife looks pitiful: she tries to smile at him pleadingly, tears are streaming down her face. Finally, he gives the bicycle to her. She grabs it quickly, says Thanks! and rides away. The schoolteacher remains behind, alone. He stands pensive, then he goes slowly back to the village. NARRATOR: The state that woman was in, who I knew was level-headed, had deeply impressed me. What had her son told her, that she didn't dare tell anybody? \n72. VILLAGE STREET. EXT/DUSK The schoolteacher goes home. TRACKING SHOT. NARRATOR: With each step I took from the estate back to the school, I felt more foolish for having given away the bicycle. As he passes the midwife's house, he sees behind the fence in the garden, half hidden behind the bushes, Marie and a few other children. The shutters of the house are closed. As I passed the midwife's house, I saw Marie, Martin, and a few other children in the garden. The schoolteacher stops, watches the children. After a few moments, they notice that somebody is watching them. MARIE: Good evening, Sir. SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening, Marie. CHILDREN: Good evening, Sir. SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you doing here? MARIE: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing. PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER: But can't       you   see   that   the shutters are closed. PAUSE. \nMARIE: Yes. We were worried. We saw Mrs. Wagner riding off on a bicycle. So we wondered what had happened to Hansi. PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you could come in here. The children go out slowly. They open the wooden gate in the fence, and go out into the street. They're visibly embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when they were doing something wrong. Some avoid the schoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, as if they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away. The schoolteacher looks annoyed. As Marie steps out of the garden door, he says: SCHOOLTEACHER: You better go back home now, hurry. Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all. Again she greets him politely. MARIE: Good evening, Teacher. SCHOOLTEACHER (reluctantly): Good evening. The children go away. The schoolteacher also goes on his way. After a few steps he turns around and looks at the children, then walks on. \nand points to a chair. Please be seated. Please. I'll fetch the kids for you. \nShe leaves the room. The schoolteacher remains standing. Waiting. Finally, the pastor's wife comes back with the two children. MARIE and MARTIN: Good evening, Sir. SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening. PAUSE. THE PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to sit down? SCHOOLTEACHER (who hasn't thought of it): Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure. They   sit   down.   The  children   sit  opposite   the schoolteacher. PASTOR'S WIFE: Can I offer you something? , (smiling faintly): A cup of coffee? Like during the piano lessons First the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decides to accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alone with the children. SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, with pleasure. That's very kind of you. PASTOR'S WIFE: I'll be back in a minute. The schoolteacher turns to the children: SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you know that the Doctor was leaving Eichwald? Short PAUSE. MARIE: No. SCHOOLTEACHER: But you don't seem surprised at my question. MARIE: Our mother told us when she came to fetch us. SCHOOLTEACHER:   And   Xenia   didn't    tell    you anything about it? MARIE: No. She looks at Martin who confirms it: MARTIN: No. SCHOOLTEACHER (incredulously): Not a word? It's very unusual for a child not to tell his classmates before going away on a trip. MARIE (unimpressed):   Xenia   never    talks   much about home. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, that's something completely different?! \nApparently Marie doesn't take it as a further question, and remains silent. SCHOOLTEACHER: I get the feeling you're hiding something from me. MARIE: What? SCHOOLTEACHER: That's what I'd really like to know. SILENCE. Then the schoolteacher turns to Martin: SCHOOLTEACHER: When you were looking for Hansi a while ago, what did you want from him? Short PAUSE. MARIE : We were worried. He's ill. SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm asking Martin. PAUSE. MARTIN: Yes. He isn't well. And since his mother is gone... we thought, we should go and pay him a visit. The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any further this way. SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you ever ask yourselves who could have treated Hansi that way? PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher adds: And Sigi? PAUSE. And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden? And who set fire to the barn? Well?! PAUSE. MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well? MARIE: We discussed it with Father. He said it must be a sick person. PAUSE. The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on. SCHOOLTEACHER:    Sigi   was    with    you at Thanksgiving. And so was Hansi. PAUSE. MARIE: I don't understand. With demonstrative helplessness she looks at the schoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at the schoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders. SCHOOLTEACHER: What did they do to you? MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): Who? \nSCHOOLTEACHER: Sigi and Hansi? MARIE (as above): Why? SCHOOLTEACHER:   They    obviously   were   being punished. For what? MARIE (as above): I don't know. SCHOOLTEACHER: Liesl foresaw that Hansi would be punished? What for? MARIE (as above): I don't know. PAUSE. Why do you ask us? PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER:   You're  an   intelligent   girl, Marie. Don't try and play dumb. PAUSE. MARIE: I don't understand you, Sir. You should talk with Father about this or with Mother. Shall I go get her? \nThe schoolteacher looks at her. MARIE: Martin, would you please get her? Martin gets up and is about to go to the door. SCHOOLTEACHER: Stay here, Martin: I'll talk to your parents when I consider it's the right time. Now, I'm talking to you. And I expect you tell me the truth. Martin sits down after exchanging a glance with Marie again. Where were you on the evening Hansi was found? MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): At home. SCHOOLTEACHER: I mean after the confirmation? At that moment, the pastor's wife enters with the coffee cups on a tray. PASTOR'S WIFE: There we are. The coffee will be ready in a minute. She puts the tray on the table. Turns to the schoolteacher, friendly as ever: Were the children able to help you? The schoolteacher looks at Marie, then he answers: SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm afraid not. They don't know anything, either. PASTOR'S WIFE: That's really odd. A doctor can't vanish into thin air. What about his patients? \n(to the children) Didn't his daughter tell you anything at school? The schoolteacher gets up, ready to leave. SCHOOLTEACHER: No. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. PASTOR'S WIFE: Why don't you stay? My husband will be back any moment, and the coffee is almost ready. SCHOOLTEACHER: That's very kind of you, but I'm really worried about the midwife's son. PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say when she'd be back? SCHOOLTEACHER: I didn't ask her. She caught me off guard. She was completely panicked. The pastor's wife shakes her head thoughtfully. PASTOR'S WIFE: Strange... Wait a second! I think that's my husband. And indeed, outside one can hear the FRONT DOOR and then the STEPS of the pastor. The wife goes to the door to open it. The pastor appears. PASTOR (surprised to see the schoolteacher): Good evening. PASTOR'S WIFE: Good evening. The schoolteacher has been anxiously waiting for you. PASTOR (to the schoolteacher): Yes? SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes. I'd like to have a quick chat with you. The pastor doesn't really understand what can be so urgent, and why the schoolteacher, which was unusual for him, came to see him in the evening. But he remains friendly: PASTOR: Please. We'd better go to my study. It's quieter there. The schoolteacher nods to the pastor's wife, who is glad that the required meeting can now take place, while the pastor walks ahead with an inviting gesture. As the pastor opens the door of the STUDY, he asks: PASTOR: Well, how can I help you? They enter the room and the pastor offers the schoolteacher a chair. Then he realizes that the windows are open and closes them, as the schoolteacher starts to speak. SCHOOLTEACHER: I spoke to the midwife today: she said she now knew who tortured her son. PASTOR (\"who\"?): She does? \nSCHOOLTEACHER: She'll only     tell   the   police. That's why she went to town. PASTOR (doesn't quite understand        what    the schoolteacher is getting at): Well? SCHOOLTEACHER: She left the boy behind alone and has locked the whole house. PASTOR: Locked it? SCHOOLTEACHER (nods): I went to the doctor's next door to ask him what was going on, whether he was taking care of the child or... But there's a piece of paper saying that the practice is closed until further notice. The doctor and his children have disappeared. The pastor has almost finished closing the windows. He pauses and turns to the schoolteacher: PASTOR (stunned): What do you mean? SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): I don't know. I thought you might have been informed. That's why I'm here. After a startled PAUSE the pastor shakes his head: PASTOR: I have no idea. He   finishes  closing   the  windows.   Then   he  goes thoughtfully over to the schoolteacher and sits down in front of him. PASTOR: Xenia... Wasn't his daughter in school? SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was. She never mentioned anything. SILENCE. The pastor ponders. Then, after a while SCHOOLTEACHER : I asked Marie and Martin. They both know nothing either. PASTOR   (looks   up   to    the  schoolteacher, \"stunned\"): Why should they? The schoolteacher almost dodges speaking further: SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. When I went to the midwife's place, they were there with a few others in the garden. PASTOR (\"doesn't understand\"): To do what?! SCHOOLTEACHER: They were looking for the boy. PASTOR (as before): Why? SCHOOLTEACHER: They wanted to help him. PASTOR: So what \nSCHOOLTEACHER (hesitates, then says): I don't know how to say it. I have the feeling they're hiding something. PASTOR (refuses): What? SCHOOLTEACHER (keeps on searching hesitantly for his words): I don't know. (finally he dares to come out with his suspicion): When the doctor had his accident... last year, you remember, Suddenly the children were in his garden. Supposedly, in order to help Xenia. PASTOR (doesn't understand): Yes... and? The schoolteacher, uneasy, breathes hard. He knows that his suspicions will seem odd, and senses that the pastor won't go along with then. SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I had forgotten it. Today, it came back to my mind again. PASTOR (as before): I don't understand. PAUSE. SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron's son... the last time he had been seen, he was with the children. The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his face slowly freezes to a mask of refusal: PASTOR: What are you getting at? Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction. But he has already gone too far to backtrack. After a PAUSE he goes on: SCHOOLTEACHER: A couple of days before Hansi was almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter had predicted precisely that to me. Supposedly, she had dreamed it. The police thinks she's lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it to her? LONG SILENCE. Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a few steps, then, after another PAUSE, turns again to the schoolteacher. His face is ashen, and he can hardly speak: PASTOR: If I understand you correctly, you're saying that your pupils, my children included, committed these crimes. Is that right? The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful gesture. He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role. Another PAUSE. Then, the pastor continues: Do you realize what you're saying? PAUSE. He breathes heavily, tries to control his emotions. Do you know... \nHis voice fails. His chin starts to shake, tears flood his eyes, and he suddenly turns away. The schoolteacher who has been looking at him, now looks down and stays where he is without saying a word. After a while, the pastor has regained enough control of himself to turn back to the schoolteacher: I assume that I'm the first person to whom you've uttered this monstrosity. Mute reaction of the schoolteacher (\"of course\"). If you ever dare to bother other people with it, if you publicly denounce respectable families and their children in this abject way, I shall make sure -- and you can take my word for it -- that you will go to prison. The schoolteacher wants to reply something, but the pastor continues: I've seen quite a lot during my work as a pastor, but I've never come across anything as repulsive as this. He looks at the schoolteacher for a moment with disdain: \n", "test1_input": "FRANZ: Who picked her? \n12. STREET AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE EXT/DAY The schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fish that he caught. NARRATOR: It was on my way home after the strange encounter with Martin that I met Eva for the first time. Eva (18), a redhead, somewhat chubby, but pretty girl, crosses him way on her bicycle. A big bag is strapped to the baggage carrier. SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello. EVA (passing by): Hello. The schoolteacher stops, turns to the girl: SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitantly): Excuse me! EVA (Off): Yes? SCHOOLTEACHER   (embarrassed):  Excuse   me   for accosting you this way. You're the new nanny of the Baron's children, aren't you? We hear the bicycle stopping. EVA (o.s.): Why? The schoolteacher has turned around and now moves toward the girl. SCHOOLTEACHER: They say you're from Oberdorf. EVA: Who says that? SCHOOLTEACHER: Folks around here. EVA: Oh. So what? SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I don't know. Sorry. I'm the schoolteacher here. I just thought I... I don't know (he laughs embarrassed): when I saw you, I thought... I'm from Grundbach... I'm the tailor's son... EVA: I know. SCHOOLTEACHER (confused): What? EVA: The Baroness already told me. SCHOOLTEACHER: What did she tell you? \nEVA: That the schoolteacher is from the village next to mine. SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): Oh, I see! Yes. Well... I thought... (he points at the bag on the baggage carrier): You look as if you're going there... EVA: Where? SCHOOLTEACHER: Back home. To Oberdorf. EVA (doesn't understand what he's referring to): Yes? SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you going there? EVA: Yes, I am. SCHOOLTEACHER (doesn't know what to say): Well, I thought... since you'll cycle through our village... you might perhaps...(he's thinking, looks down and sees the fish): ... say hello to my father and (laughing at his own idea, he holds up a fish) bring him one of the fishes. They're fresh. I just caught them. Now Eva laughs too. EVA: What?! SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling as if to apologize): Well. I'm sure he'd be delighted. Especially as it's the start of the weekend. She nods at the fish. The absurdity of the suggestion amuses her. At the same time she doesn't really know how to behave. EVA: Well, how... The schoolteacher holds up the fish, laughs, as if he himself doesn't how he got this idea. SCHOOLTEACHER:    I     don't    know    either. Unfortunately, I have nothing to wrap them in. The both laugh. Pause. Then the girl points at the bag on the baggage carrier of her bicycle and says regretfully: EVA: Neither have I. Unfortunately. The schoolteacher has a new \"idea \": SCHOOLTEACHER (\"amused\"): I could give you some fishing line, to tie them up. EVA (equally amused): There on the bicycle?! The schoolteacher shrugs his shoulders with a smile (\"why not\"). EVA: I don't think that's a very good idea. \nSCHOOLTEACHER:    You're   right.   It   was   just   an idea. EVA: Yes. Embarrassed pause. Then SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that your bicycle? EVA (\"What an idea!\"): No! It belongs to the estate. SCHOOLTEACHER: I see. Pause. SCHOOLTEACHER: Is this your first day off? EVA (rather suspicious because all this is too intimate for her): Yes. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, you're         probably   looking forward to being at home. EVA: Yes, I am. SCHOOLTEACHER: I can imagine. Pause. Then EVA says (putting the pedals and handlebar in a \"ready to leave\" position): Well. I've still a long way to go. SCHOOLTEACHER (stepping back): Of course. Well, good-bye. EVA: Good-bye. She's about to ride off. SCHOOLTEACHER (with a smile): If you cycle through Grundbach and see my father, at least say hello to him from me. EVA: I don't know your father. SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true. They look at each other for a while and then Eva rides off. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her. Eva and the bicycle are tottering a bit. The girl looks around and shouts, laughing: EVA: I only learned to ride a bicycle today! SCHOOLTEACHER (now o.s., also shouting): Well, you're doing fine! But be careful! As she picks up speed, Eva rides better and soon is just a speck on the dusty country road. \n13. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DUSK It's still too early to switch on the light. Xenia and little Rudolph are sitting in the kitchen, eating. For quite a while. Suddenly RUDOLPH: The woman today. What was wrong with her? XENIA (eating): Which woman? Oh, I see. She was dead. Pause. Then RUDOLPH: What's that? XENIA: What? RUDOLPH: Dead. Xenia looks up from her meal. XENIA: What's dead? My God, that's when someone doesn't live anymore. When he's stopped living. SILENCE. Then RUDOLPH: When does one stop living? Xenia looks up from her meal again. Now she tries to talk more seriously to her brother because she understands that these questions matter to him. But she's also feeling uneasy and put on. XENIA: When you're too old or very ill. RUDOLPH: And the woman? XENIA: She had an accident. RUDOLPH: An accident? XENIA: Yes. That's when you hurt yourself very badly. RUDOLPH: Like Dad? XENIA: Yes, but much worse than that. So bad, that your body can't take it anymore. Another SILENCE: Then RUDOLPH: And then you're dead? XENIA: Yes.      But   most   people   don't   have   an accident. RUDOLPH: That means they don't need to die? XENIA: No, they die much later. RUDOLPH: When? XENIA: Later, when they're very old. Long PAUSE. \nRUDOLPH: Do all people die? XENIA: Yes. RUDOLPH: All of them, really? XENIA: Yes, everyone dies. RUDOLPH: But not you, Xeni? XENIA: Me too. Everyone. RUDOLPH: But not Dad? XENIA: Dad too. RUDOLPH: Me too? XENIA: You too. But not before a very very long time. All of us, only in a very long time. RUDOLPH: And you can't do anything against it? It has to happen? XENIA: It has to happen. But not now, not for a very long time. Long PAUSE. Then RUDOLPH: And Mom? She didn't go on a trip? PAUSE. RUDOLPH: Is she dead too? PAUSE. XENIA: Yes. She's dead too. But that was a long time ago. Both remain SILENT. In the meantime it has grown dark in the kitchen. Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the table with an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia. The plate shatters on the floor. At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed. Then she starts to sob, but tries to hide it from her brother. \n14. RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHT While we hear the SOUNDS of the punishment and the children being beaten, COUNTING the strokes with increasing MOANS and stifled WHINING, we see (CLOSE ANGLES) the faces of the other brothers and sisters. Some have turned away their faces, and others start to cry with pity and fear. Finally both have received their 10 strokes. CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor. He is breathless and beads of sweat on his forehead. PASTOR: There. \nHe hands Martin the cane. CLOSE ANGLE: Martin. Here, take the cane and put it back in its place. As Martin is about to go, his father goes on: But first you can thank me for trying to protect you from any further misconduct. CLOSE ANGLE: Marie. You know how much I love you and how much it hurts me to inflict such pain on you. Today was a very sad day in my life, and I hope for all of us that it doesn't happen again. CLOSE ANGLE: Both kiss their father's hand. CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor. PASTOR (smiles): And now hug me. There's nothing we have to forgive each other anymore. I love you with all my heart. He first hugs Marie who, her face still wet with tears, tries a forced smile and then Martin. Then, the pastor turns to his wife: PASTOR: Now the ribbon, Anna. Anna goes toward the two children, tying a white ribbon around Martin's upper arm and another in Marie's hair. PASTOR: This will remain on you until we're all sure you have learned how to fight bad thoughts and manners. You're well aware, this year you will receive Christ's body in the form of bread and wine. Until then, strive to be free of sinful thoughts. Now let's eat. Martin carries the cane out of the room. The pastor and the other children sit around the table. Marie leaves the room with her mother. After all the others have sat down and put their plates back where they were before the punishment, the two come back with two soup bowls and put them on the table. Martin has also come back and sits down at his place beside his father. The pastor folds his hands in prayer, the others follow suit. PASTOR (very friendly): Marie, would you say grace today? MARIE (smiling eagerly): With pleasure, father. She bows her head, so do the others. MARIE: Come Lord Jesus and be our guest And bless what you've given to us. PASTOR: Amen. Blessed be this meal. THE OTHERS: Blessed be this meal. \nThe mother and Marie open the soup tureens and hand out the soup. Then they eat. \n", "test1_true": "16. ESTATE. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. BEDROOM. INT/NIGHT The steward and his children Liesl (15), Georg and Ferdinand (10)] are waiting for something. Then the door opens and the midwife comes out. She tells them to come into the other room. NARRATOR: That night, the wife of the steward gave birth to her fourth and last child at the age of 42. The children want to follow their father. At least Liesl, a chubby and good-natured teenager, rather plain, can't wait to go in. But the midwife tells them to be patient, and only the father is let through. LIESL (burning with curiosity): What is it? MIDWIFE (smiling): Well, what do you think? LIESL(shakes   her   head   impatiently):   I   don't know. MIDWIFE: It's a boy. FERDINAND: Oh God! \nMIDWIFE: What do you mean?! Don't you want a brother? FERDINAND: Pff! MIDWIFE: You're lucky your father can't hear you. Instead of the father, Georg hits his brother on the back of the head. They quarrel. MIDWIFE: Stop that! She steps in and distributes a few smacks. Liesl runs out of the room howling. MIDWIFE: You should be ashamed. FERDINAND (Suddenly, as if he'd become another person): Sorry. The midwife looks at him, confused. \n17. TRACK NEAR THE FARM EXT/DAWN The farmer, Franz and Paul leave the farm, they go to work. The two oldest carry scythes. In the background vast fields of crops. The three walk hurriedly. After a while FRANZ (hesitantly): Father, I have to tell you something. FARMER: What is it? FRANZ: I went to the sawmill. The farmer keeps on walking as if he hasn't heard. Franz looks at him from the side. For a long moment he remains silent, while all three keep walking. Then, Franz goes on softly: The floor, on the first level, where mother worked, was totally rotten. They keep on walking. The steward, who sent her there, must have known it. And the landowner too. The farmer remains silent. They keep walking. Father?! FARMER (hostile): What do you want? FRANZ (doesn't understand his father's refusal): They sent her there knowing it was dangerous. The farmer stops, turns to Franz: FARMER (aggressive): What are you getting at? FRANZ (doesn't understand): But... \nFARMER (furious, but with forced calm): Do you want me to sue the Baron? Or kill the steward? FRANZ: I... FARMER: Go and cut off his head of with your scythe. Sure, that'll bring your mother back to life. He turns away from Franz and keeps on walking. The others follow. After a few steps FRANZ (softly): I think our father loved our mother. Suddenly the farmer stops and screams, almost crying with fury and despair: FARMER: Shut up! CLOSE ANGLE: Paul. He was listening carefully the whole time. He looks at the father. Then, lowers his eyes. NARRATOR: After these two days in July, life in the village returned to what it had always been... \n18. MONTAGE EXT/INS./DAY/NIGHT a) Harvesting. Even teenagers and children are used to tie the sheaves and to do other easier jobs. NARRATOR: ... The daily harvesting drove the people almost to exhaustion. Most of the children were busy helping their parents. \nb) The midwife is doing housework in the Doctor's house. A quarrel between her retarded son and the 4-year old Rudolph (that we barely can follow due to the Narrator's voice, o.s.) is settled by the midwife in favor of her son. For the time being, the doctor remained in the hospital. In the meantime the midwife catered the basic needs of Xenia and Rudolph, his two children. After the burial of the farmer's wife, that was attended by the whole village, the two accidents were soon forgotten... \n19.   MANOR EXT/DAY NARRATOR: ... until the harvest festival at the end of the summer brought the whole village \ntogether again, first in a festive hustle and bustle, and then in horror and perplexity. \n", "test2_input": "BARON: Where did you see my son for the last time? TUTOR: Outside, in the courtyard. He said, he was going to play with the other children. BARON: Where? TUTOR: That he didn't say. BARON: And      my   wife   didn't   notice   anything either? TUTOR: After that business with the cabbage heads, Madame retired to her room. She was indisposed. BARON (sarcastically): Indisposed?! TUTOR: Yes. She had a terrible migraine attack. BARON (almost to himself): My God, this place is a zoo! He turns away and goes out into the courtyard. The tutor follow him with his eyes. He feels he's being badly treated and hates the Baron for his insults. Finally he goes back up the stairs. \n31. MANOR. EXT/NIGHT BACK TO THE SCENE. The torches of the feast have almost burned out. Here and there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitate the cleaning up. Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vast courtyard. Half way across he screams: BARON: Br\u00e4ker!! The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who are putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the barn. He walks toward the Baron. BARON. Have you seen my son? STEWARD (surprised): No. BARON (quietly): Could you please ask your boys. Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole bunch of kids. STEWARD:    Immediately.   (shouting    to   the farmhands): When you're finished with the cleaning up, wait for me. There's still a job to do. Get some fresh torches and lanterns! BARON: In the meantime I'll go round up the men. \nThe steward goes to his house, the Baron         to   the outbuildings. There, he switches on the SIREN. \nNARRATOR: The steward's children said, they had seen Sigi only for a short time, that he had gone off with other kids, and that they didn't pay much attention to it... \n32. MONTAGE EXT/INT/NIGHT IN THE COURTYARD. Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches. The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns the areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out by the narrator's voice. \nNARRATOR: ...The search began shortly after midnight. Before, the Baron had ridden to the Rectory. But there he found out nothing new from the children who had been specially woken up. \nSTABLE AND OUTBUILDINGS OF THE ESTATE. VARIOUS LANDSCAPES: FOREST, FIELD, RIVER MEADOWS. The search. The searchers, who were tired and some of whom were still drunk, were divided into two groups: one group started to search all the buildings on the estate, one by one, while the others combed the surrounding areas. It was around half past two, when some members of the search party had already preferred to lie down   somewhere   and   to   sleep  off   their drunkenness, that the siren suddenly sounded again, calling the men back to the courtyard... IN THE COURTYARD. The men come in with a stretcher. ...They had found Sigi. He had been tied up in the old sawmill, upside down. His trousers had been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding from cane strokes. He seemed to be in a state of shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher, lying on his belly. \n33. CHURCH INT/DAY The room is packed. The whole village is gathered. \nNARRATOR: The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end of the service, asked the pastor if he could say a few words: \n", "test2_true": "Unrest in the attendance. \n...because they wanted to \"get even\". Get even for what? Because their mother had died while she was working in the sawmill, and it was supposedly  my  fault,   which  is  an  absurd assertion. \nThe farmer, Leni and the other children are there, with the exception of Franz. \nThe unrest grows. \nAt least, that's what Franz Felder gave as the motive for his \"mowing prowess\", when the policemen arrested him. I have always supported the farmer Felder and his family, but one can't always expect people to be grateful. That's a matter of character. \nThe farmer wants to leave the church. \nBARON: Don't run away, Felder. It's your honor I want to salvage. It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder has been boasting of his feat in front of his fianc\u00e9e. Then the coward that he is, hid among his family, and so he didn't have time to torture my son. And there's one thing I know for sure: the senior Felder would rather bite off his tongue, than cover for his wayward son. May I remind you something what most of you have already forgotten. Almost two months ago, the doctor had a riding accident and he has still not returned from the hospital. This accident was caused by a wire that had been strung in his garden with the explicit intent of bringing him down. And in that case too, nobody knows anything, saw anything or heard anything. \nDisconcerted MUTTER among the attendance. \n", "test3_input": "SCHOOLTEACHER (calming her down): Don't worry. Try to calm down. There's nothing to worry about. \nEVA (sobbing, childish): There is. \nSCHOOLTEACHER (with a calming smile): Come here and sit down. Please calm down and then tell me what happened. All right? \nShe's sits down on the school bench beside her. The schoolteacher sits on his haunches in front of her: \nWell?! \nIt takes her time to calm down. \nWhat happened? \nSlowly she manages to calm down, breathes deeply a few times. The schoolteacher is visibly charmed by her childish despair. \nEVA: The son of the Baron isn't at all well. His parents are angry and desperate. Now they say that it's the tutor's and my fault, because we didn't pay enough attention to him. But I'm only there for the twins. \n", "test3_true": "I've always taken care of them very well. When you and I were dancing, the Baroness had given me permission. I haven't done anything wrong, really. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: I know, come on. Stop crying! \nEVA: Where shall I go now? We need the money I was earning here. \nSCHOOLTEACHER:   You'll  find   something  else. Besides, you know very well that the Baron is quick-tempered. With him, nothing is ever as bad as it seems. \nEVA (fiercely shaking her head):No, no, that's all over now, I know it. The Baroness doesn't want to see anyone. She wants to take the children with her to town or to her parent's estate \u00ad I don't know exactly. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: (after a pause): I'll try to talk to her. A while back, we played music together. (with a smile): Unfortunately, I wasn't very good. Now she's got the tutor, he plays better. As far as I know, he's been studying music in town. \nEVA (forgetting her grief a bit): He doesn't play that well. \nSCHOOLTEACHER: That's true. \n"}

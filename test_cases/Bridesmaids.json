{"train": "INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE. \nAnnie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun. \nANNIE Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here. \nDONNA (quickly) Annie! Thank God. OK people! Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle. Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA. \nDONNA (CONT'D) (slightly overdramatic) Something terrible has happened. Donald will not be coming in to work today. He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling. Employees mumble. \nDONNA (CONT'D) Annie? Where's your tie? Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to put it on. \nDONNA (CONT'D) Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment that I can't change or they'll will charge me. So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings. Now I-- Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly. \nDONNA (CONT'D) Sandy? Today's your day. \nSANDY Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie. \nDONNA Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. You think you can handle it? \nEMPLOYEE (SOTTO) Yeah, look out. There might be a bum- rush for letter openers... The employees snicker. \nANNIE Sometimes there is, so....there have been. At times, there has been. \nDONNA Alright everybody, let's get to work! Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her. \nANNIE Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really- \nDONNA Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting? \nANNIE Five? \nDONNA I just made all of that up. None of that was real. I just put words together. You're not ready for the big leagues. Understand? \nANNIE It's so hard to make commission over there. \nDONNA Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer? \nANNIE Many times. \nDONNA She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it. \nANNIE Okay. (beat) I do want it. \nDONNA (smiling) Good. Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things. \nDONNA (CONT'D) Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal. It's reckless! Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section. \nANNIE Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V. \nT.V. HOST When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic. I've never seen so many cupboards! \nINT. ANNIE AND STEVE'S APT. THAT NIGHT. \nSTEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch shirtless and is enthralled by the show. \nSTEVE Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart. Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over? As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her room. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going to bed? \nANNIE Yes. I'm beat. \nSTEVE Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away. \nANNIE Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her. \nSTEVE That credit lady called! She wants to talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V.. \nALLEN (ON SHOW) This is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing. We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading room. \nSTEVE Gross/Amazing. \nINT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. \nShe sits on her bed grabs a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSounds to Relax\u00e2\u0080\u009d CD with a post-it that reads, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLove, Mom\u00e2\u0080\u009d. She plays it and lies down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her bed. \nINT. JONI'S RESTAURANT. THAT FRIDAY NIGHT. \nAnnie and Lillian read magazines. \nLILLIAN The madness has begun. Dougie's parents are having an engagement party for us next Friday. \nANNIE Awesome!... \nEXT. STREET/NEWSSTAND. NEXT MORNING. \nAnnie, in her jogging clothes, reaches for a wedding magazine, but a woman's magazine catches her eye. It \nANNIE (looking around) Ooh, what's this... She finds the article. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHurry, before he gets away! Top five ways to reel him in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nMAN (O.S) Excuse me. A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching for a magazine. She can't thing of what to say. She remembers the magazine! It reads \u00e2\u0080\u009c#1. A simple, flirty \n'S working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it, but it keeps ringing... \nANNIE Hello? \nHELEN (ON PHONE) Annie!? \nANNIE Yes? It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots of candles glowing. \nINTERCUT: \nHELEN Hi. \nANNIE Hi. \nHELEN Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of Lillian's bridesmaids. \nANNIE Of course, Helen. Hi! \nHELEN Congratulations on being selected. \nANNIE Oh, thank you. Annie, reads \u00e2\u0080\u009c#2. Expose your best asset. ASAP\u00e2\u0080\u009d She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but politely smiles and goes back to his magazine. \nHELEN Annie? \nANNIE Sorry, yes. Hi! \nHELEN Maid of Honor!! \nANNIE Yeah. It is quite an honor. \nHELEN It's the number one spot. So how many times have you been in the B.P? \nANNIE I'm sorry, the what? \nHELEN Bridal Party? \nANNIE I've never even been in a wedding before. \nHELEN What!? I've never even heard of that. \nANNIE Um, well, it should be fun. Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his magazine! She reads\u00e2\u0080\u009c#5. Make a funny observational joke that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE \n\u00c2\u0080\u009d SHE and the golden retriever meet eyes. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Um Helen, can you hold on for a second? \nHELEN \nOH-- Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy. \nANNIE Hey, you're dog's really cute. \nMAN Oh thanks. \nANNIE It's kinda funny right? That when girls are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond. \nANNIE (CONT'D) (beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly girls. But I'm not friends with them. I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone. \nHELEN'S VOICE Hello?! \nANNIE Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited for all the wedding stuff and-- \nHELEN YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from Lilly with all of the other girls' information, and when you respond to any wedding related e-mails from now on, just remember to hit \u00e2\u0080\u009cREPLY ALL\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum. \nRHODES Good afternoon ma'am, You in a hurry to get out of the city? \nANNIE No. Was I speeding? \nRHODES Is that even possible in this rig? He finds this funny, Annie does't. \nRHODES (CONT'D) You know funny thing about brake lights, you're supposed to have \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. \nANNIE Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out. \nRHODES Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches Curve. That's a risky move. \nANNIE I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year. \nRHODES Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That is not something you wanna go broadcasting to a police officer. I might feel obligated to give you a yea's worth of tickets now. \nANNIE What? No.. I- \nRHODES You just admitted it. \nANNIE Can you do that? \nRHODES You admitted it. (beat) Yeah, I can't do that though. \nANNIE Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will get the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really - \nRHODES Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a wedding. She lost some of her hair from the stress. Again, not funny. \nANNIE Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence. \nRHODES Uh, yeah. That's what happens when you break the law. Um...license and registration. \nANNIE Here. He writes a ticket. \nRHODES (searching for words) Ooo, I like that air freshener. Did you get that at the gas station? \nANNIE I don't remember. \nRHODES Smells like Christmas. (sniff) Yeah, it smells like Christmas. He rips the ticket off. \nRHODES (CONT'D) Well, here you go. And just so you know it's a just a fix-it ticket. So if you get those lights repaired, you wo't have to pay anything. \nANNIE Oh, Okay. \nRHODES Whoa, are those moon-pies? \nANNIE Oh yeah. \nRHODES (mumbling) Oh, those are my favorite. \nANNIE What? \nRHODES Nothing. (mumbling) Those are my favorite. \nANNIE Do you want one? \nRHODES No. It's too much trouble, they look all wrapped up. She doesn't get the hint. He really wants one. \nRHODES (CONT'D) Well, have fun at your party. Annie drives off. He watches. \nEXT -THE HUNT CLUB. CHICAGO SUBURB. Annie, a little embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet and grabs the moon-pies. She walks into an elegant country club dining room, lively cocktail party. Music, happy people, etc. She is greeted by Lillia's mom, \nLAURIE. \nLAURIE Annie, sweetheart! \nANNIE Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug. \nLAURIE Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies! Laurie takes the tray. \nLAURIE (CONT'D) Can you believe our Lillian? \nANNIE I know, I'm so happy for her. \nDANA (CONT'D) Don't you just love weddings?

I'm Dana and this is my husband Ernie. So...how did you two meet? She refers to a bald man who looks like a chemistry teacher, who is slowly walking by looking for someone. \nANNIE No, I don't know him. He's not with me. He's just passing by. I'm not here with anyone. BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good looking stockbroker type. \nBECCA Lil! Is this Annie?! Annie and Lillian walk over. \nBECCA (CONT'D) Hi Annie!

The room is all aflame. \nHELEN (CONT'D) So how do you like our club? \nANNIE Yeah, I was just telling Lillian i's very elegant. \nHELEN So you live in Milwaukee? \nANNIE Yeah in the nice part. I work at Harrington's Jeweler's. I love it. \nHELEN Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you soon. Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her. \nWOMAN You're very pretty. \nMEGAN (O.S.) Annie! Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper. \nMEGAN (CONT'D) Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers. A place just opened up near my house.

CONTINUOUS Annie and Donna are doing inventory. Annie gets text. \nANNIE Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache. \nDONNA Don't be nervous. It's not all on your shoulders. Doesnt she have other bridesmaids? \nANNIE Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian. \nDONNA I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day. They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk. \nANNIE That dress is beautiful. \nDONNA I still have it. I was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their \u00e2\u0080\u009cceremony\u00e2\u0080\u009d they both wanted to wear suits. (beat) Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets. Annie struggles to write with her nails. \nANNIE Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write... \nDONNA They're very long. \nINT. SEXY NAIL.

She sees a buzzer. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Oh, I didn't see that. She presses the buzzer. \nVOICE FROM INSIDE Hello? \nANNIE Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses. \nVOICE FROM INSIDE What's your name? \nANNIE Really? \nBECCA And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now. \nHELEN I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter. \nMEGAN The fly just committed suicide. Death by butter. \nDANA Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time! \nLESLIE Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel. \nHELEN (sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today. \nDANA I was set up with Ernie.

You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you? \nRHODES Nah... The reason I pulled you over today, is that--(searching) you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic. \nANNIE I was? \nRHODES Yep. You were going ten miles under the speed limit. That's a moving violation. It's...underdriving. It's in the books. But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to write. Beat. \nRHODES (CONT'D) Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master Cleanse. You ever heard of it? \nANNIE Yeah. \nRHODES Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff? \nANNIE Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Sorry. \nRHODES No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We had tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em. (beat) Okay. I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper. OH!

The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches. \nSANDY Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy open their checks. \nSANDY (CONT'D) Oh my God, I scored this week.

Call me. \nRHODES Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out there. \nANNIE Very funny, Officer...Jones? \nRHODES Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was. \nANNIE No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk. \nRHODES That's ok. Call me Rhodes.

I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral. \nANNIE That's a very good point. \nOFFICER RHODES Want a carrot? \nANNIE Yes. I'm starving. \nCONTINUOUS: They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot. \nRHODES Oh, you got the ugly carrot. \nANNIE The what? \nRHODES There's one in every bag. You should eat it. \nANNIE No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands. \nANNIE (CONT'D) No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!! She throws it on the ground. \nRHODES Don't litter. He picks it up. \nINT. RHODES' POLICE CAR. \nANNIE I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life. \nRHODES Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems unnatural. \nANNIE I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up. \nRHODES Just tell her the truth. \nANNIE Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car. \nANNIE (CONT'D) It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students. \nRHODES You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop. And I love my job. \nANNIE Hmm. I think I get it? \nRHODES Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road. \nANNIE Moonpies. What? \nRHODES It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over. \nANNIE Oh yeah. \nINT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT COUNTER. LATER \nThey are waiting in line. \nAnnie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on the couch watching the same Home Improvement show. \nTV HOST Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning. \nGIRL ON SHOW Thanks. \nSTEVE Unbelievable. (to Annie) You got another package from your mom. \nANNIE Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer. \nSTEVE No problem. But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty car. \nANNIE Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas? \nSTEVE Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense? \nANNIE I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been. \nSTEVE Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings. When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay? \nANNIE No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride. \nSTEVE Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas. \nANNIE Well, I could save up for it. \nSTEVE No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNight Moves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Can I have this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag. \nANNIE Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear bridal party\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat idea\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbachelorette party\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlorida\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSea World!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFree place to stay!\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames. \nHELEN I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World? \nANNIE Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days. \nHELEN But a bachelorette at Sea World? \nANNIE Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it. \nHELEN Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings. \nANNIE Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Hello? \nBECCA Hi, Annie. It's Becca. Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Whitman's\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nBECCA (CONT'D) I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey? That's where we went for for MY bachelorette. \nANNIE Oh well, Turkey's really far away. \nBECCA It's super old though! They have awesome restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like that. \nANNIE Hang on... Annie clicks back over to Helen. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back? \nHELEN When? \nANNIE Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Becca? \nBECCA Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas. \nANNIE Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me. \nBECCA I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I have a system. Annie's other line. \nANNIE Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back? \nBECCA When? \nMEGAN Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now? We are gonna nail it down. We should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins! \nANNIE Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas! Woo! Lillian walks up. \nLILLIAN Annie, come here. Why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us? \nANNIE Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket. I'm here though, right?! \nLILLIAN I'm so excited! \nANNIE Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party! We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites... As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe New Marquis Royal Suites.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nHELEN Lillian, look what's happening. \nLILLIAN Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?! \nHELEN I got a limo from the hotel. We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!! They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking. \nANNIE Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a ride to the hotel. It's taken care of. \nMEGAN (from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie! \nEXT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES. LATER \nThe girls' excited talking continues into the lobby. \nLILLIAN This hotel is amazing! You guys! \nHELEN Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite. It's all set. \nLILLIAN Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one hour! (waving her key) \nUPSTAIRS. HOTEL HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS. Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement. Annie gets back into the elevator. \nANNIE Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head? \nEXT. HOTEL. CONTINUOUS. \nAnnie sneaks out, rolling her bag. She catches a cab. \nEXT. HOTEL RICK. LATER. \nCab pulls up to a tiny broken down building. A sign reads \u00e2\u0080\u009cHotel Rick. Vacancy. Some T.V.s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An old man rides a bicycle in circles in the parking lot, smiling. \nINT. HOTEL RICK. CHECK-IN DESK. \nLobby is very outdated. Wood panel walls etc., The hotel brochure is on the desk. It is probably the picture she saw online, it does NOT look the same. The clerk enters. \nANNIE Hi, I have a reservation for Walker. RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit. He holds the pose, smiling. \nRICK Okay, two nights? \nANNIE Yes. Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never does. \nRICK Do you want towels? \nANNIE Yes. \nRICK Do you need sheets? \nANNIE Yes. \nRICK No pillow though, ok? Annie just stares at him. \nINT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES \nThe door opens to reveal a gorgeous huge feminine suite. \nHELEN AND LILLIAN (gasp) OH MY GOD! \nINT. HOTEL RICK. ANNIE'S ROOM \nAnnie opens her door holding unfolded sheets and towels. The room is very ugly, bare mattress, lots of brown. \nANNIE Oh my God. \nINT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES \nMegan and Leslie stand in their grande bathroom. Hot tub, plush towels, flat screen T.V. Candles burning. \nMEGAN Oh my gosh, I can't believe this. \nANNIE I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge after this. \nHELEN We are. After that. \nANNIE Oh...um...wow. Awesome. Here's the thing I was going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites. I think I ate something weird on the plane probably, my stomac's not right. \nHELEN Oh, well we're only gonna be there for an hour or so, you can just meet up with us after. \nANNIE Okay. Perfect. \nHELEN I'll just text you when we're getting ready to leave. I hope you feel better. Lillian comes up already a little tipsy. \nLILLIAN Ok, Leslie spilled the beans. Le's get our asses over to Sacrifice. What are we waiting for? Wooooooo! Lillian looks at Helen's legs. \nLILLIAN (CONT'D) Whoa whoa. Helen, turn around. Are those those Ransom Jeans? \nHELEN Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them from New York. They're insanely expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny. She sticks her butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh. She is the life of the party. \nEXT. RESTAURANT. CONTINUOUS \nA party bus pulls up. As the doors open, dry ice pours out. Inside there's a disco ball, dance poles, crazy lights. The girls all scream and run onto the bus. With the commotion, no one notices that Annie stays behind. \nINT. CASINO. LATER. \nAnnie enters casino alone, sadly weaves through the slot machines. \nINT. PARTY BUS \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Prerogative\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Bobby Brown comes on VERY LOUD making conversation difficult. Lillian looks around for Annie. \nLILLIAN Oh my God, Annie our song! Wher's Annie? \nDANA What?! \nLILLIAN Where's Annie?! \nMEGAN I don't know!(to Helen) Where's Annie! \nHELEN What?!! \nDANA Where's Annie! \nHELEN She's meeting us later!!! \nDANA (to Lillian) Oh.

(giddy laughing) \nGUYS Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie gets a text message. \nINT. JUNGLE LOUNGE. \nAnnie walks through the club. She calls Lillian. No answer. She gets a a drink. Time passes. Her phone rings! \nLILLIAN Annie! \nANNIE Hello!? \nLILLIAN Are you ok? \nANNIE Yeah, I'm fine. I'm here! Where are you?! \nLILLIAN What do you mean here, where? \nANNIE I'm at the Jungle Lounge, where are you guys?

We had to leave the Jungle Lounge, Becca-- \nANNIE What?! \nLILLIAN Meet us at the-- \nANNIE Hello?!! \nINT. PARTY BUS. \nLoud music. Lillian tries to call Annie back. Annie tries to call Lillian back. They both get voice-mails. Annie gives up. It starts pouring rain on her inside the club. Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement. Thunder! \nCLUB D.J. Me Tarzan, you Jane. It's time for the dance spotlight. If it lands on you, you gotta shake it! The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie. She dances very angrily. Jungle dancers dance very close to her and put vines around her neck. \nINT. BAR NEXT DOOR \nAnnie walks in. \nGUYS Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah! \nDAVE What happened to you? \nANNIE I don't even know. \nDAVE Roller, I can't stand seeing you like this. (to bartender] Get this fine lady a shot! \nANNIE I'll have two lemon drops. \nINT BAR. HALF HOUR LATER. Annie and Dave are wasted. \nANNIE That's what I'm saying. Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things. It's not fair. I don't get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen. \nDAVE I hate Helen. \nANNIE That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said. \nINT. ANNIE'S ROOM. HOTEL RICK. \nIn the dark, Annie and Dave are passionately making out. Knocking things over, etc. \nDAVE I hate Helen. \nNEXT MORNING. ANNIE'S HOTEL ROOM The cat jumps on the bed and meows. Annie opens her eyes to see Dave sleeping. She notices his college tattoo on his arm (tasmanian devil with a lacrosse stick?). \nDAVE Hey. \nANNIE Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were making out. I guess I was pretty tired. \nDAVE Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey. \nANNIE Oh shit. There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal NICOLE, (20), pretty and sweet. \nNICOLE Is Dave here? \nDAVE Nicole!? Hey, Nic. \nNICOLE This is a surprise. \nBrian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well. \nBRIAN 1 Dude, I'm sorry. She made us bring her here. \nDANA By this huge girl. She was a working in the bathroom. I just... I didn't cut in line. I didn't! She chased me! \nBECCA Becca it's over. \nMEGAN Annie, she looked like Popeye. \nBECCA She lives here! She lives in Vegas. \nHELEN You're not going to run into her. Just shut-up about it. \nLILLIAN Guys stop! Please! Annie, I'm so sorry about last night. I feel horrible. I want to hear everything that happened. Tonight, you're not leaving my side. We're hittin' the strip club all of us and we're going to put this shit behind us. Okay?! The girls agree. Dana rubs her arm. \nLESLIE Oh your arm does not still hurt. \nINT. FANCY CASINO SHOPPING MALL. LATER. \nBridesmaids window shop. Something in a fancy boutique catches Annie's eye, she smiles. Ransom jeans. \nINT. STRIP CLUB. THAT NIGHT \nThe ladies sit at the front row tables. \nCOCKTAILER What can I get you ladies? \nANNIE First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here. Here's a hundred. Keep twenty for yourself. \nLILLIAN Oooh, Ann! A siren goes off. \nV.O. Good evening ladies, and welcome to Thunderbird. Our first male entertainer has been roaming the prairie for many, many lonely nights... A horse winnies. Ladies scream. \nV.O. (CONT'D) Here he is...looking for a sweet lady to keep him company under the stars...say hello to Cowboy Ron! A male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping \n'S looking for someone. The room goes wild. \nV.O. (CONT'D) There he is ladies looking for that special woman, looking for his briiide...And I believe the person he's looking for is Lillian Donovan! The girls scream. Lillian mouths to Annie \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm gonna kill you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage. He puts her in a chair and humps her face. Everyone is cracking up. \nMEGAN Leslie, your missing it. \nLESLIE Don't talk to me. Nobody talk to me. Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is dancing in her face. Stripper #2 appears. \nV.O. Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend on the prairie and he's lookin' for a lady too. \nLILLIAN (pointing to Annie) Get her! Get her!! \nANNIE \nNO! NO! Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the ground and simulates sex with her. Standing above her, pulls his chaps off. We see that his balls are not all the way tucked into his g-string. The girls cringe. As he stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth. She dry heaves. The stripper is oblivious, goes to another girl. Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing. \nEXT. STRIP CLUB. \nEveryone's laughing as they exit the club. \nANNIE I need some gum. \nBECCA That was disgusting! I'm so glad I'm married. \nMEGAN It was awesome! \nDANA I got a picture of the balls. I got it! \nLESLIE (puts her arm around Annie). You lucky bitch. \nLILLIAN Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment of the weekend. Annie finally feels a part of the group. \nINT. AIRPLANE. DAY. \nAnnie walks to first class, everyon's sleeping. She hears Lillian laughing really hard, pointing at pictures in a magazine. \nLILLIAN Oh look, there's your boyfriend. \nHELEN Ew, he's like 65. Ok, look Lillian that's you. \nLILLIAN Oh my God. You know who that actually looks like? Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels-- \nHELEN Ew, at that beach, that weird beach! \nLILLIAN And that lady came up to us wearing that mesh top! \nHELEN She was crazy. Annie sinks. A flight attendant appears. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Excuse me. Hi. \nDOCTOR Have you recently come in contact with or slept anywhere that you think you might \nHAVE-- \nANNIE I know where I got it. \nDOCTOR You're gonna have to wash every fabric in your apartment and I'll give you a topical cream that should knock it out pretty quick. I've got some samples. \nEXT - LILLIAN'S APT. DAY Annie sits on the doorstep. Lillian runs up with a bunch of stuff in her arms and opens the door. They enter the apartment. \nLILLIAN I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh. What's that on your arms? She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion. \nANNIE Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it. \nLILLIAN Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one thing really quick. When is my hair consultation? Lillian frantically looks through her calender. \nANNIE Listen, I want to talk to you about-- \nLILLIAN Oh no. (starts to cry) \nANNIE What's wrong? \nLILLIAN I knew it. I'm going to have my period on my wedding day...and my honeymoon! \nANNIE It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your first time doing it. \nLILLIAN It's our wedding night though! \nANNIE You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed. \nLILLIAN I can't believe this. This sucks. (beat) Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio? \nANNIE' Can you just realize what you just asked me right now? \nLILLIAN What? \nANNIE You just said a string trio or horn trio. I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep it simple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a big deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nLILLIAN I know but now that I'm planning everything it's just...I wanna do it right. It's once in a life time. It's my wedding. Lillian's phone rings. \nLILLIAN (CONT'D) Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me because I won't let her invite everyone from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know? I gotta free up some spots. (into phone] Hello? Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless. \nINT. ANNIE'S LAUNDRY ROOM. \nDryer is going. Annie is sorting a huge pile of sheets, towels, etc. Her cell phone rings. \nANNIE Helen. \nINT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM. CREAM COUCH \nHELEN Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck? \nANNIE No, I'm doing laundry, what's up? \nHELEN Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We haven't heard from you and everyone is- \nANNIE I know. I know. I'm trying to-- \nHELEN Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian. \nANNIE Wow. \nHELEN You don't have to give me an answer now \nBUT-- \nANNIE You should have it. You should have it. \nHELEN Great. Well, I'll definitely need some help. \nANNIE Ok? \nHELEN Could you bring the cookies? Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles. Pissed. \nINT. HARRINGTONS. LATER \nAnnie behind her counter. \nGIRL Excuse me!! A snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands at Annie's counter with an iced coffee chewing gum. \nGIRL (CONT'D) I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend. \nBUTLER Are you a guest of Helen Harris? \nANNIE Yes. \nBUTLER The shower is one mile away. He hands her a pink lemonade. \nANNIE I don't have a cup-holder. As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car. \nANNIE (CONT'D) \nWHAT THE- One flies in her car. They're Rose petals! Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and take it. \nVALET This will be placed in the gift room for you madame. He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him. \nANNIE I'll take those. \nAnnie watches the valet drives her car away. When she turns back around, there is a man with a white horse holding out his hand to her. \nHORSEMAN Would you like an assisted ride to the main house? \nANNIE Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She dismounts. The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her... \nSHOWER GIRLS This is the most amazing shower 've ever been to/Can you believe this?/What a lucky bride/What a good friend... Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round \u00e2\u0080\u009csign\u00e2\u0080\u009d that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cLillian and Dougie\u00e2\u0080\u009d in puffy pink cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it. \nBECCA AND LESLIE(O.S.) Annie! They walk to her. \nLESLIE Do you believe this shit? Annie is still staring at the sign. \nBECCA That's a big cookie huh. \nANNIE Where? They point to the \u00e2\u0080\u009csign\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie. \nLESLIE See. Sugar cookie. \nLeslie takes a piece off, eats it. \nLESLIE (CONT'D) It's even better if you dip it in the chocolate. REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise. Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a nearby table. \nLILLIAN Annieee!!! Lillian runs to her. \nLILLIAN (CONT'D) (under her breath) Can you believe this? \nLAURIE (O.S.) Lillian! \nLILLIAN Coming Mom! I gotta go say hi to my aunts. She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again. \nHELEN Hi Annie! \nANNIE Beautiful party. \nHELEN Oh, it's nothing....so...Just make yourself at home. Enjoy! \nANNIE Thanks. (under her breath) Asshole. \nHELEN What did you say? \nANNIE I said I love this shower, and i's amazing. I said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach Helen and jam out in her face. \nHELEN OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance with the GUESTS! \n'S looking. \nINT-HELENS POWDER ROOM Annie puts lotion her hands. She sees a magazine photo of \n'S face super imposed over them. On the counter is a framed photo of Helen, soft lit, posed with her hand gently \n'S face. She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian from Vegas on the plane. Happy. As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom, wh's new hairstyle is a bit overdone. \nANNIE Mom. Hi! They hug. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Wow! You look great. \nJUDY Thank you sweetheart. (to herself) I wish Barb could see me now. \nANNIE Not today Mom. \nJUDY You're right. Well I'm happy to see you! I'll see you out there. I need to wash the horse off my hands. Mom goes into the bathroom. Megan approaches. \nMEGAN Annie, did you see the party favors? \nANNIE I'm sure they're perfect and amazing. \nANNIE Are you fucking kidding me? \nJUDY Annie! \nANNIE \nARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! \nLILLIAN Annie! What is going on with you? \nANNIE Nothing have fun at Sea World. \nHELEN Why don't we go in the other room and-- \nANNIE Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--. \nHELEN Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don't know what you mean. \nANNIE I think you do.(laughs) Horses? Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture! (pointing outside) And look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie. I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard. \nANNIE (CONT'D) (shouting, we see her through the large \nWINDOWS) Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it. We watch her from the house. Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers? \nEveryone is watching Annie. She is fighting and punching the air like a crazy person, chasing a swan. A little girl starts crying. Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd holding her chocolate covered hands in the air. \nANNIE (CONT'D) I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her. \nLILLIAN Annie stop! I don't know what's going on. \nANNIE Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit. \nLILLIAN I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds? \nANNIE I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you! \nLILLIAN This is my wedding and you've made it all about you. \nANNIE Well at least my friendship's not for sale. This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside. \nHELEN Do you think she still has body lice? \nLILLIAN Anyone else?! Anyone else have something they wanna say to me?! Dana can't contain herself. \nDANA I got my chin done! Becca stands up. \nBECCA Kevin smokes pot! Leslie stands up. \nLESLIE I'm pregnant! Megan stands up. \nMEGAN I took two dogs already. There in the back of my van! \nINT. ANNIE'S CAR. MOMENTS LATER- HIGHWAY. \nAnnie is pissed. She sees a squirrel in the road (close up of squirrels big eyes). She tries to avoid it, slams on her breaks and BOOM! Annie is rear-ended! The driver behind her backs up, peels out and drives away. \nANNIE Thank you! Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry. A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nRhodes is looking under her hood. \nRHODES Well, I can't say I'm surprised. \nANNIE Yes. Taillights. I know! \nRHODES You should've taken it to my friend- \nANNIE I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't-- \nRHODES Whoa. Don't take it out on me. This is your fault. \nANNIE HE hit ME! \nRHODES You had no taillights! You did't get them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe else. It's your fault. Annie starts to walk away. \nRHODES (CONT'D) Where you going?! Annie keeps walking. \nRHODES (CONT'D) Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?! Another WISE decision! \nWOMAN Is anyone sitting here? \nANNIE No. The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY. \nAnnie looks in the classifieds.

Listen I'm going out tonight but I should be home around 11, you wanna come over? \nANNIE Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves. \nINT.

There's been a lot of 'em. \nDANA Well it came out a little mean Helen. \nHELEN Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless. \nBECCA What was that? \nDANA Did we hit something!? \nHELEN Was it a person? \nANNIE Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car. \nBECCA/DANA No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch dark out. \nHELEN Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911. \nLESLIE You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM! \nANNIE Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on. \nLESLIE I'm calling AAA. \nBECCA I'm calling Kevin! \nANNIE Helen, do you have a jack? \nHELEN Probably?! \nDANA What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal? \nANNIE Dana calm down. \nLESLIE Shit! I don't have any service. \nBECCA Me neither! \nDANA Oh my God! We're gonna die... Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window. \nINT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. CONTINUOUS. \nANNIE Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car. \nLESLIE So, how can I help? \nANNIE Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen. \nDANA That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire. \nBECCA I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone. \nHELEN Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe. \nDANA So what are you doing now? \nANNIE I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off. \nBECCA How does that little thing lift the whole car? \nMEGAN It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons. \nLESLIE How do you know this stuff? \nMEGAN I like cars. There's a real artistry to them. \nHELEN Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night. \nDANA (quickly) Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait. \nEveryone's speechless. \nHELEN Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen. \nDANA I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now. \nDANA (CONT'D) Lillian probably left because of you anyway. \nHELEN What!? \nDANA You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's not me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time!

Annie pretends to wake up. \nTED (CONT'D) Wow, you look beautiful. \nANNIE \n(ACTING EMBARRASSED) What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the morning. I look terrible.

But you know, I'm dating, here and there... \nHELEN Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding? \nANNIE Oh, I didn't even think about that. \nLESLIE Who needs a date?

And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent. \nHELEN Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because... I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that. \nANNIE Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture.

But it's all good now. We all talked and everythings cool. \nHELEN Really?! \nANNIE Yup, Helen and I are best friends now.

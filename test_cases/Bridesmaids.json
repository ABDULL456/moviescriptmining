In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her. \nANNIE Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary. \nHELEN With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every...scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional. \nHELEN (CONT'D) They say when you choose a mate, yo're choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best friend that I could ever ask for. Annie's face goes blank. \nHELEN (CONT'D) I have never had a friendship like this.

They both laugh. \nANNIE God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech-- \nLILLIAN Ann, stop. \nANNIE I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party? \nLILLIAN Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect. They laugh and hug. \nLILLIAN (CONT'D) I gotta go say bye to some people I do't know. Drive safe. Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin air. \nHELEN Annie! Great job tonight.. \nANNIE I'm feeling slightly mortified. \nHELEN No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas. \nANNIE Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things? \nHELEN Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and-- \nANNIE She just got engaged two weeks ago. \nHELEN Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber. \nANNIE Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen. \nGUEST Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You have beautiful cursive. \n", "test1_id": 1743, "test2_input": "DOCTOR Have you recently come in contact with or slept anywhere that you think you might \nHAVE-- \nANNIE I know where I got it. \nDOCTOR You're gonna have to wash every fabric in your apartment and I'll give you a topical cream that should knock it out pretty quick. I've got some samples. \nEXT - LILLIAN'S APT. DAY Annie sits on the doorstep. Lillian runs up with a bunch of stuff in her arms and opens the door. They enter the apartment. \nLILLIAN I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh. What's that on your arms? She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion. \nANNIE Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it. \nLILLIAN Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one thing really quick. When is my hair consultation? Lillian frantically looks through her calender. \nANNIE Listen, I want to talk to you about-- \nLILLIAN Oh no. (starts to cry) \nANNIE What's wrong? \nLILLIAN I knew it. I'm going to have my period on my wedding day...and my honeymoon! \nANNIE It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your first time doing it. \nLILLIAN It's our wedding night though! \nANNIE You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed. \nLILLIAN I can't believe this. This sucks. (beat) Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio? \nANNIE' Can you just realize what you just asked me right now? \nLILLIAN What? \nANNIE You just said a string trio or horn trio. I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep it simple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a big deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nLILLIAN I know but now that I'm planning everything it's just...I wanna do it right. It's once in a life time. It's my wedding. Lillian's phone rings. \nLILLIAN (CONT'D) Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me because I won't let her invite everyone from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know? I gotta free up some spots. (into phone] Hello? Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless. \nINT. ANNIE'S LAUNDRY ROOM. \nDryer is going. Annie is sorting a huge pile of sheets, towels, etc. Her cell phone rings. \nANNIE Helen. \nINT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM. CREAM COUCH \nHELEN Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck? \nANNIE No, I'm doing laundry, what's up? \nHELEN Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We haven't heard from you and everyone is- \nANNIE I know. I know. I'm trying to-- \nHELEN Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian. \nANNIE Wow. \nHELEN You don't have to give me an answer now \nBUT-- \nANNIE You should have it. You should have it. \nHELEN Great. Well, I'll definitely need some help. \nANNIE Ok? \nHELEN Could you bring the cookies? Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles. Pissed. \nINT. HARRINGTONS. LATER \nAnnie behind her counter. \nGIRL Excuse me!!

Did you ever think of that? What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are? Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Huh? And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent? \nGIRL Ummm....you're weird. \nANNIE You're stupid. \nGIRL You have no chin. \nANNIE You're gonna be a slut in high school. \nGIRL You are an old, single loser who has no friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car. \nShe sips in victory, slurps up the last drop noisily. \nANNIE (quietly] You. Little. Cunt. The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time. \nINT. DONNA'S OFFICE \nDonna stands across from Annie wh's cleaning out her locker. She sadly starts to leave. \nANNIE Bye. \nDONNA You know, I knew a girl once. Karen Stippleton. She was really something. The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night. But one evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store. And I'm gonna say something to you I should have told her. Don't waste your life. Find out what your gifts are and use them. Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room. \nINT.

On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates.

DAYTIME. \nAnnie's relaxation CD is playing as she lies talking on the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert. \nJUDY Is there an animal over there? \nANNIE No, it's a C.D. She rolls over and turns it off. \nJUDY So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day of the shower cause I wanna get my hair done. Did you see that invitation?

It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go. \nJUDY Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca't let her new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history with her that no one else has. So you walk into that party knowing that. \nINT. ANNIE'S CAR. \nAnnie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit sign) \u00e2\u0080\u009cLillian's Shower Rue. This exit\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nANNIE Oh my God. She turns into the gates of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhitewater Estates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by. At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray. \n", "test2_id": 1744, "test3_input": "MEGAN Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack. \nANNIE Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile. \nANNIE (CONT'D) There it is, turn left up here. Go down the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway. It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met. \nLESLIE God I haven't been here in forever. \nANNIE The house is right up here. They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car. \nHELEN Her car's not here. \nDANA Doesn't look like any lights are on. \nBECCA She's not here. Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated. \nANNIE I thought she'd be here. I really thought she'd be here. I'm sorry. \nDANA Annie, it's ok. \nANNIE No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent. \nHELEN Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because... I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that. \nANNIE Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled by the flash. \nHELEN I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets. \nANNIE I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a porn. \nHELEN Oh, I didn't know that you did that. \nANNIE Oh, well, sorry. \nHELEN I deserved it. \nANNIE I must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events. \nHELEN Well, I'm really rich. They smile. \nANNIE It is getting pretty late. \nDANA What should we do about Lillian? \nANNIE She'll come home when she's ready. \nINT. ANNIE HALLWAY. LATE THAT NIGHT (EARLY AM] \nAnnie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against her door. Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to her. After a minute. \nANNIE You okay? \nLILLIAN Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry. \nANNIE It's okay. I really am sorry. \nLILLIAN I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to turn out like this. I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect. \nANNIE Well its easy to get caught up. \nLILLIAN And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother. \nANNIE I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all talked and everythings cool. \nHELEN Really?! \nANNIE Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow. \nLILLIAN She's really not so bad. \nANNIE I know. \nLILLIAN I just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie. And now, it's become this thing I never wanted. I did want simple. I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to play all those stupid wedding songs. \nANNIE It's not too late to have those things. \nLILLIAN I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you were going through too. Annie is clearly sad. \nANNIE It's fine. I just feel really lost right \nNOW AND-- Lillian hugs her. \n", "test3_true": "ANNIE Oh God dont say that. \nLILLIAN I mean between you and me. \nANNIE You want to come in? Steve's home. This could be your last chance as a single woman. \nLILLIAN Ooooo... \nEXT HIGHWAY. VERY EARLY NEXT MORNING The small paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car pulls up. This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before. He gets out and walks over to it, confused. He picks it up and it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOfficer Rhodes\u00e2\u0080\u009d. He's a little weary but opens it and pulls out a note. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear you like moonpies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looks in the bag and smiles. \nEXT. WEDDING RECEPTION. BELMONT CLUB.

They look like they are talking and working things out. He hugs her and kisses her. Lillian and Dougie dance into frame. They are very close. Smiling and kissing. They've never looked happier. She smiles at someone. It's Annie. Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also. Steve approaches. \nSTEVE Thanks a lot for bringing me. \nANNIE Thanks for coming with me. Megan appears on her other side. \nMEGAN Yeah, thanks for bringing him. \nMegan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to dance. Annie is alone, watching everybody.

Yo've been the best Maid of Honor ever. \nANNIE Really? \nLILLIAN (kidding) MMM. No. That's not true at all. You were pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle. \nANNIE Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel. \nLILLIAN You're always gonna be my best friend. They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs. \nANNIE I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs. Price! \nLillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie runs towards the shuttle. She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She JUST missed it. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course. The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on the other side of it. \nRHODES (O.C.) Need a ride ma'am? It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him. \nANNIE How did you know I was here? \nRHODES It was really complicated. I remembered the name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles. \nANNIE Wow. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do. \nANNIE (CONT'D) So, did you get the moonpies? \nRHODES Yes I did. \nANNIE Did you like' em? \nRHODES Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants. \nANNIE Ooo, I didn't think about that. \nRHODES You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so... He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about to kiss. Rhodes stops. \nRHODES (CONT'D (CONT'D) I didn't want to miss my chance again. \nANNIE \n(SMILING) Me neither. They MAKE OUT. The end. \nALT ENDING Annie is walking back to her hotel.

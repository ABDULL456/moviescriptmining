Craig walks out the back.  He steps over the door.  Unlocks it, and cracks it open. 
CRAIG Day-Day ain't here. 
They don't believe him. 
D'WANA Who are you? 
CRAIG I'm his cousin. 
BABY'D You suppose to work here now or something? 
CRAIG Yeah, I work here now. 
D'WANA We didn't come here for Day-Day. 
CRAIG Yes you did. 
D'WANA No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD. 
BABY'D Now move. 
Baby'D kicks the door.  Craig has no choice but to let 'em in. 
D'WANA Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here? 
CRAIG I don't know... I think he went out the back. 
D'WANA Can I look for myself? 
Suddenly Roach is pushed into the front area. 
ROACH Hey, ladies. 
D'WANA Where's Day-Day? 
ROACH I don't know, he must've left. 
D'Wana looks at Baby'D. 
CRAIG I thought ya'll wanted to buy a CD? 
BABY'D I do... can you help me find the jazz section? 
Craig looks at Roach for directions.  He nods over towards the front of the store. 
CRAIG Right this way.  You know damn well you don't listen to no jazz. 
Baby'D checks out Craig as he leads the way.  D'Wana looks around. 
D'WANA If Day-Day comes back, tell him I came by and need to see him.  Lamaze classes are Wednesday. 
ROACH Will do. 
D'Wana starts to walk towards Craig and Baby'D. 
D'WANA Come on, 'D, let's go. 
But first she doubles back towards the storage room. 
CRAIG Where you going? 
D'WANA Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee. 
ROACH Yeah. 
D'WANA Thank you. 
As she's walking in the back, Roach realizes his mistake.

CLAIRE Jody! 
INT.  FOYER - NIGHT 
Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway.  She turns and goes back into the house. 
CRASH! 
She edges into... 
INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  She drops to her knees over the picture.  This time THE GLASS IS SHATTERED.  When she picks out the remaining shards, the newspaper photo slides out.  Claire glances at the benign news stories on the back. 
She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack in the floor boards by the knot. 
CLAIRE'S POV 
The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER COIN in the crack.  It's too big to be a penny. 
She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but recoils.  A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which she pops into her mouth. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Still sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to clean up the remains of the seance.  She bends down to pick up the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub is again full to the brink of overflowing. 
CLAIRE What do you want?! 
Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply. There is only silence.  She reaches in to pull the plug, nearly scalding her hand.  When she turns for a hand towel she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror: 
"YOU KNOW" 
She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom. 
EXT.  LAB BUILDING - NIGHT 
Norman nods to a SECURITY GUARD as he leaves a darkened university building.  He sees Claire standing at the foot of the steps. 
NORMAN What are you doing out here? 
CLAIRE He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and-- 
NORMAN This is the Feur thing? 
CLAIRE Yes.  And he's going to get away with it. 
Norman's momentarily speechless. 
NORMAN How do you know this? 
CLAIRE We had a seance. 
NORMAN Who did? 
CLAIRE Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave. 
NORMAN How did you-- 
CLAIRE Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her. 
He regards her for a moment. 
NORMAN Are you angry at me? 
This stops Claire in her tracks. 
CLAIRE What? 
NORMAN Maybe you resent how busy I've been. 
CLAIRE What are you...?  No. 
NORMAN You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow. 
CLAIRE Sabotage? 
NORMAN Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or... 
CLAIRE The accident...? 
NORMAN But then you've been so much better... 
CLAIRE Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not... 
NORMAN Sweetheart--

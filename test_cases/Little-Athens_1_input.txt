JESSICA (not exactly confident) I can be more... persuasive in person. 
Jessica punches another number into her Cell Phone. 
CARLOS (disappointed) Swell. 
KATIE'S VOICE Hello, this is Katie Kinney! 
JESSICA Katie, it's Jessica. 
KATIE'S VOICE Where are you? 
JESSICA Have you eaten? 
KATIE'S VOICE I'm starving! 
JESSICA Okay, I'm going to be home in a little bit, okay? 
KATIE'S VOICE Alright. 
Jessica hangs up and throws her Cell Phone on top of the dashboard. 
JESSICA Drive. 
Carlos starts the Car. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS 
ESTABLISHING SHOT on the Car pulling back out onto the street as Kwon continues talking to the Police Officer in the background. 
EXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY 
ROB is riding his newly-acquired MOPED, with COREY on the back. Corey is holding Rob with one hand, his BASEBALL CAP with the other. He drops Corey off in front of Mr. Carson's house. 
As Rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame, Corey walks up to the front door of the house. He rings the doorbell, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a wad of BILLS as he waits. Mr. Carson opens the door. 
COREY Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent. 
Mr. Carson opens the screen door, and Corey hands him the Bills. Mr. Carson begins counting them. 
COREY (CONT'D) Can you let us back into our apartment now? 
MR. CARSON This is only one month.   You boys owe three. 
COREY That's all we have. We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can. 
MR. CARSON When you get me the rest, I'll let you back in. 
COREY Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just temporary. Pedro lost his job. 
MR. CARSON Bullshit. You're always late. You should spend less time trying to rob houses, and more time working. 
COREY Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out? 
MRS. CARSON (O.S.) Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door already you stupid bastard! You're letting the cold air out! 
MR. CARSON (suddenly in a hurry) Tell it to my lawyer. 
COREY Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless! 
MRS. CARSON (O.S.) Shut the goddam door! 
MR. CARSON Three months! 
Mr. Carson slams the door. 
COREY (banging on the door) C'mon! 
Corey stands and stares at the door a moment.   He turns and leaves, resigned to a long walk back to the pool. 
EXT. DINER, BACK-LOT -- DAY 
PEDRO is driving nonchalantly toward the back-lot.     A song is playing on the car radio. 
WIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the passenger side of it. Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang. 
Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas gage. It's more than 3/4 full. 
Satisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and hitches the Mustang to the back of it. An older couple pulls into the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang. OLDER MAN and OLDER WOMAN climb out of their CAR. The Older Man has taken an interest in what Pedro is doing. 
OLDER MAN Hey, can I park here? 
PEDRO (very friendly) Si, si, of course. (motioning toward the Mustang) The transmission is broke.   Transmissions on these cars suck. 
Older Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat. 
OLDER WOMAN (pointing) Oh, and the tire's flat, too. 
Pedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised to see the FLAT TIRE. 
PEDRO Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's fine, believe me. 
Older Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the diner.

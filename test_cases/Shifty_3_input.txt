SHIFTY Yeah. 
VALERIE Are you sure it wasn't two thirty. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY It may have been. 
VALERIE I was out on the balcony at two thirty. 
A BEAT. 
VALERIE (CONT'D) But I was in here at two. 
A BEAT. 
VALERIE (CONT'D) I'll make us some tea. 
SHIFTY Yeah, that'll be sweet. 
INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY 
Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He looks slightly shocked to see this. 
CUT TO: 
Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed. 
Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle. 
INT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY 
Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the counter top. 
SHIFTY How you been, alright. 
VALERIE Yeah, I'm alright babe, you alright? 
SHIFTY Yeah, I'm alright. 
VALERIE Good, good. 
Silence as Valerie prepares the tea. 
SHIFTY She visited you yet? 
VALERIE No... not for a long time, Shifty... not seen her for a long time really, darling. 
Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He places a hand on her arm. 
SHIFTY She'll come back one day. 
They carry on making the tea. 
INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY 
The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music. 
We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some. 
CHRIS No, no, I'm fine......thanks though. 
CLOSE ON SHIFTY. 
SHIFTY Look Val we're gonna have to do one... 
THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO SHIFTY... 
Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly unsettled by what he's seen.

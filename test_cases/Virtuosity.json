(a beat) If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation. \nPARKER You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it \u0097\u0097 I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. \nMADISON That's not true, Parker. \nPARKER If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. \nMADISON (a beat) What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy? \nPARKER Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. \nMADISON You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. (a beat) You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target... \nPARKER Go to hell. \nMADISON It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it? (a beat) But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved. \nPARKER Enough! \nThe Guard pokes his head in with concern. \nMADISON GET OUT! \nThe Guard quickly shuts the door. Madison turns to Parker. \nMADISON (CONT'D) I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand. \nPARKER I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that. \nCUT TO: \nON A VIRTUAL REALITY MONITOR \ninside Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC, the stunningly beautiful SHEILA 3.2 appears. In very revealing lingerie. Performing an outrageous strip\u0097tease. \nSHEILA 3.2 (seductively) I hope watching me is as big a turn on for you as dancing is for me... \nINSIDE LETAC \nReilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he could touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body. \nREILLY Oh, believe me, it is. It is... \nHe is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other hand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine. \nOn the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her strip\u0097tease. \nSlowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips. \nPutting on quite a show. \nShe removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her nipples. As well as the rest of herself. \nLindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely control himself. \nSheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A virtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer pushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens. \nREILLY HEY!!! \nLINDENMEYER Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours. \nREILLY (paranoid) I haven't been working on anything. \nLINDENMEYER (threateningly) Do I get to see it or not? \nREILLY (a beat) Bastard... (to a monitor) Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. \nHe rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next to Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila 3.2 enjoys the attention. \nSID 6.7 She's some of your finest work, Daryl. \nLINDENMEYER All my work is my finest. \nSid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races back in, the monitors then all go BLACK. \n", "test1_true": "LINDENMEYER (backing away fast) Get that fucking thing away from me! \nREILLY (laughing) You're...such a wimp. \nHe grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the snake. The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops moving. \nBut the half still in Reilly's hand begins REGENERATING a new tail. Literally growing a new one. Lindenmeyer can't believe his eyes. He studies the snake closely. \nREILLY (CONT'D) Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea. \nLINDENMEYER (in awe) It's nano\u0097technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules... \nREILLY (proudly) Coordinated by polymer neural net. \nLINDENMEYER (touching the snake) It feels so.. .real. \nREILLY It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... (a beat) It's a physiological machine. \nLINDENMEYER (awed) This is supposed to be years away. \nREILLY As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away. \nLINDENMEYER (restraining himself) How do you kill it? \nREILLY Separate the character module from the neural net... \nUsing Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head and removes a small character module connected to the base of the neural net. The snake stops moving. It \"dies.\" \nREILLY (CONT'D) ... and you get nano\u0097death. (discarding the snake) Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones. \nLINDENMEYER Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is. \nREILLY I know. (a beat) I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you... \nHe exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character module, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and winks. \nSID 6.7 You catching my drift? \nLINDENMEYER I think I understand what you have in mind... \nPeeling the label off the Sid 6.7 character module, Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. Sid 6.7 disappears from the screen. \nCUT TO: \nREILLY \nopening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes later. Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry. As well as a large aquarium full of nano\u0097pythons. \nLINDENMEYER You need a maid. \nREILLY What I need is a nymphomaniac. \nHe removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank with a circular window in the middle of it. \nClear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of increasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in electrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous system. \nINSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE \nReilly turns to Lindenmeyer. \nREILLY Where's the Sheila 3.2 module? \nLindenmeyer hands him the label\u0097less character module. Reilly opens the \"incubator.\" \nINSIDE THE INCUBATOR \nReilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the synthetic nervous system. \nThe polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows around the module. Cells (nano\u0097mechanisms) immediately begin adhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal architecture. \nINSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE \nLindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window. \nREILLY It feeds on what is basically amniotic fluid. (a beat) In eight hours, we are going to have ourselves one hell of a play toy. \nOff Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE PARKER'S CRAMPED PRISON CELL \nIt's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to it is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards sent each year by Chief Cox. \n", "test1_id": 2397, "test2_input": "Parker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a SURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon inserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole. \nParker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater implant into Parker's brain. \nANESTHETIST (looking at monitor) You are right on the border of his corpus callosuni. \nSURGEON He is under, isn't he? \nANESTHETIST (nodding) Won't stop him from dreaming, though... \nParker's rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is correct. Parker is dreaming. \nINSIDE A VIEWING ROOM \nCox and Deane watch the operation through a large window. \nMadison enters, carrying a folder labelled:\tINMATE #673429 A/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from the folder, placing the first one in front of Deane. \nMADISON This is Parker Barnes six years ago. The most decorated cop in the history of L. A. P. D. Special Investigations Division... \nThe photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN CLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then distorting. Becoming surreal. Resembling one of the images from Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nPARKER'S EYES \ndarting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues dreaming. You now realize you are seeing what he is seeing: \nFlashes of color. Shapes. Mostly blurs. A splash of gold. Along with some yellow. More images from Parker's cell. Both taking feminine form. One adult, one child. \nMADISON (V. 0.) This is Parker with his wife and daughter. Beautiful young family, weren't they? \nThe bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images. Flashes of men's faces. Melting into urban decay. Unhappiness. Technology. \nMADISON (V. 0. CONT'D) This is the group of cyber anarchists Parker was closing in on. \nMelancholy turns violent. Glimpses of weapons. Death. Explosions. Death. Blood. Death. Caskets. Tombstones. Images moving so fast, it's hard to tell what they are. Nothing literal. \nMADISON (V. 0. CONT'D) This is what Parker's wife and daughter looked like after they were kidnapped and executed. \nWeapons firing. Bombs exploding. Images of rage in all its forms. Many of which you've already seen. Making one thing now clear: the paintings in Parker's cell represent his life. What he was. What he lost. And what he is. \nMADISON (V. 0. CONT'D) This is what the cyber anarchists and two people who just happened to be in the wrong club at the wrong time looked like after Parker finished with them. \nTears. Hopelessness. Detonation. And finally blackness. Complete and utter blackness. \nCUT TO: \nELIZABETH DEANE \nlooking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in front of her inside the Viewing Room. \nDEANE (unfazed) That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby\u0097 trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter? \nMADISON (forcefully) Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous. \nDEANE Not if you're with him every step of the way. \nMADISON The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again. \nDEANE I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you. \nINSIDE THE OPERATING ROOM \nAs Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head is tested. Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic map to within one inch of his present location. The hole in his skull is then stitched shut. \nCUT TO: \nPARKER \nputting on his L. A. P. D. uniform and badge inside a Prison Interrogation Room. He looks very much like he did in virtual reality, except for the scar on his cheek, and his empty holster. Cox and Madison look on. \nPARKER (to Cox) I don't need a baby\u0097sitter. \nMADISON What you need is a collar. \nCOX (to Parker) She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick. \nPARKER What she's going to do is get in my way. \nCox hands Madison a thick folder. \nCOX This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. \n", "test2_true": "COX Fine \u0097\u0097 you want to stay here? \nHis cellular phone RINGS, which he answers. As he listens to the call, his expression is one of growing concern. He clicks off the phone. \nCOX (CONT'D) Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. (a beat) So were the first two cops to arrive on scene. \nPARKER Their weapons missing? \nCOX (nodding) Sid 6.7 is now armed. \nPARKER Where's my gun? \nCox glances to Madison, then hands Parker a .45. \nCOX Be careful with it. \nCUT TO: \nAN L. A. P. D. SQUAD CAR \npassing through the Security Checkpoints outside the Prison. Parker at the wheel. Madison beside him. It's afternoon. \nINSIDE THE SQUAD CAR \nParker presents his identification to a GUARD, then drives through the final checkpoint. Madison reviews Lindenmeyer's file. \nMADISON (without looking up) You remember how to get to Toluca Lake? \nHe glances at her, then stops the car. \nOUTSIDE THE PRISON GATES \nParker gets out of the car. Madison follows suit. \nMADISON What are you doing?! \nHe walks around the car, brushing past her. Then drops to his knees at the side of the road. He puts his hands in the dirt, feeling the earth between his fingers. \nPARKER (meaningfully) Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive. (a beat) Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie. \nMADISON It wasn't a lie. \nPARKER Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it. \nTaking a deep breath, he wipes the dirt off his hands. Then stands. \nMADISON You all right? \nPARKER (completely at ease) Fine. Never felt better in my life. (a beat) See, I'm a good liar. \nHe gets back in the vehicle. Off Madison's reaction, we \nCUT TO: \nSEVERAL TV REPORTERS \ntalking live to their cameras on the street in front of a beautiful, suburban home in Toluca Lake, which is now a crime scene. 6 PM. \nREPORTER (to her camera) ) As L. A. P. D. Officers continue gathering evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves \u0097\u0097 what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes? \nParker and Madison make their way through the curious trying to see what's going on. Several REPORTERS double-take Parker, then quickly instruct their PHOTOGRAPHERS to take shots of him. \nParker and Madison present their identification to the COPS keeping the curious at bay. \nCOP #1 (recognizing Parker) Son...of...a...bitch. \nParker and Madison continue toward the house. Getting an increasing amount of attention, particularly from the other COPS. Some look on with awe. Some with disdain. But nobody is in between. \nMADISON (quietly to Parker) You ready for this? \nPARKER Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody. \nHe gives her a brief smile. Which Madison does not return. One of the other policemen tentatively approaches Parker. \nCOP #2 I've always wanted to tell you that if the same thing happened to me, I would do the exact same thing as you --\tif I had the balls. \nHe extends his hand to Parker, who shakes it. \nCOP #3 (to Cop #2) Then you'd be a disgrace to the badge, too. \nHe turns to Parker, who is looking right at him. Not with anger. Not with any emotion, really. But it's enough to scare the shit out of Cop #3, who walks away. \nINSIDE THE SUBURBAN HOME \n", "test2_id": 2398, "test3_input": "Investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every device imaginable. Parker and Madison survey the scene with nothing but their eyes. \nLying in the middle of the living room are the four victims: \nthe affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their bodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except their heads have been interchanged. \nParker and Madison turn their attention to a message written in blood on a wall. It reads: DEATH TO THE PIGS. \nMADISON (knowledgeably) He was re\u0097enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders. \nPARKER Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene. \nMADISON Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better \u0097\u0097 to improve upon what was already done. \nPARKER Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends. \nMADISON I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. (a beat) Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. (a beat) The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7? \nPARKER I know who would know. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX \nin Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a space across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front of them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if Lindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically. \nMADISON (sarcastically) You drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years. \nHe ignores her as they get out of the car. \nPARKER Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file? \nMADISON He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin. \nPARKER What happened when he was 17? \nMADISON Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. (a beat) Stay here. \nShe approaches the cops, who remain in their car. \nMADISON (CONT'D) Any sign of Lindenmeyer? \nUNDERCOVER None, yet. \nMADISON Mind if we take a look inside? \nUNDERCOVER Not until somebody gets a search warrant signed. It's Sunday. I don't think they've even found a judge, yet. \nWHAM! They all turn their heads to see Parker has kicked in Lindenmeyer's front door and is going inside. \nUNDERCOVER (CONT' D) (shaking his head) I'm gonna have to call this in. \nMADISON Do what you've got to do. (running after Parker) So will I... \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX \nMadison races through the broken front door to find Parker checking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for Madison to freeze and be silent. \nParker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex. His every movement is now that of a predator. \nMadison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She does not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head. \nMADISON (quietly) You've got a problem with me carrying a gun? \nPARKER Do me one favor \u0097\u0097 if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it. \nParker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms furiously. His movements are aggressive. Madison searches other rooms methodically. She is not timid. Just inexperienced in the field. \nShe passes a video camera mounted on a tripod. Pointed out the window at a neighbor's bathroom. Dozens of cassettes surround the tripod. The labels are dated \u0097\u0097 covering every day of the last month. \nParker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other. Madison puts down her gun. Parker does not. The noise persists. \nPARKER (looking through his sight) Bang... \nHe smiles wickedly, and continues on. Madison takes a deep breath, then resumes her search. Parker and Madison end up \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S HOME OFFICE \nIt's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here. Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, books, folders, disks, and tapes. \nWhat you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to DIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, anarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the autobiographies of human villainy. \nCLASSICAL MUSIC and life\u0097like SOUND EFFECTS can be heard coming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing. He holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her pulse. \n", "test3_true": "MADISON (clinically) Checking my pulse. It's elevated. (a beat) You enjoy frightening me, don't you? \nPARKER You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think? \nON THE COMPUTER MONITOR \nAn animated man, who resembles Lindenmeyer, walks peacefully through a park. He then starts killing everything in sight. Men, women, squirrels, even flowers. All to classical music. \nThe scene immediately starts over, with the man once again walking peacefully through the park. This was Lindenmeyer's SCREEN SAVER. \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE \nLooking around the room, Madison shakes her head. \nMADISON This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work. \nPARKER (looking at a book shelf) Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him... \nHe runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books in particular. Their titles are: UNDERSTANDING THE CRIMINAL MIND, and CRIMINAL PURSUIT -- A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. They were written by Dr. Madison Carter. \nPARKER (CONT'D) I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. \nMADISON I'm still working on it. \nNoticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. You read its name: MAESTRO. \nMADISON (CONT'D) Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains? \nPARKER I've been in prison, remember? \nMADISON The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho. \nPARKER Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one... \nMadison elects not to respond. She sits down at the computer, which rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and begins typing at the computer. She works with efficiency. Knowing exactly what she's doing. She is now in her element. \nFrom a shelf, Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup. Then flips through one of the books written by Madison. Only half-interested. \nMADISON (keeping her eyes on screen) I am the demon from the bottomless pit... \nPARKER (remembering, not reading) ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, \nMADISON I am impressed. \nPARKER (quoting) For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. \nMADISON Who said that? \nPARKER Hamlet. (a beat) What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7? \nMADISON (pointing to the screen) He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite. \nON THE COMPUTER SCREEN \nThe graphics show you that Sid 1.2 was a combination of Charles Manson and Billy the Kid. You see what look like two viruses, which represent each criminal's psychological profile, attacking each other. The result is a molten blob. \nBerkowitz was added to create Sid 1.3. A three-way psychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs. Sid 1.4, adding the terrorist, Abu Nidal, makes the conflict even more violent. And so on. \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE \nMadison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid. \nMADISON Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain. \nPARKER (understanding) Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. \nMADISON But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones. \nShe continues opening the files of the higher versions of Sid. Version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. The visualized psychological battle is intense. And extremely violent. The 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse. \nMADISON (CONT'D) It's a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others. (a beat) The question is, which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control? \nAttempting to open the files of the composite profiles, Madison discovers they are protected by encryption. \nMADISON (CONT'D) (re: Lindenmeyer) ) He'll let us see the ingredients that went in, but not how the soup turned out after stirring. \nMadison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at the name MATHEW GRIMES. Alarm registers on her face. As Parker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen. He holds the Sid 6.7 CD-ROM in hand. \nPARKER This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. \nMADISON As a matter of fact, it is. \nParker points to a name on the screen:\tJEFFREY DAHMER. \n", "test3_id": 2399}

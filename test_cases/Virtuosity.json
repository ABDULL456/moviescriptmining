{"train": "VIRTUOSITY by Eric Bernt 3rd Rewrite 8/24/94 \nVIRTUOSITY \nby \nEric Bernt \nTHIRD REWRITE   August 24, 1994 \nTwo men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle. \nThe sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997. \nSummer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the horizon. Making the sky look peculiar. \nThe men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop, watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER. \nNEWSCASTER (V. 0.) As L. A. P. D. officers gather evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves \u0097\u0097 what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes? (a beat) The three adjectives which best describe this killer are sadistic, intelligent, and dangerous... \nThe guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems almost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or he's got more important things on his mind. \nEverybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians. \nTheir uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department. The guy in the lead is \nPARKER BARNES His body is a running back's. His endurance a marathoner's. His face one you'd want for your own. He's in his 30s. If he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous. \nHis partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself. He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on their way. \nParker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless: \nJOHN I can't get over how different you look. \nPARKER (ruefully) Five years can be a bitch, huh? \nThey split-up. The Maitre D', still facing the front doors, repeats his greeting to no one in particular. \nMAITRE D' Good afternoon. May I help you? \nParker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the hunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you would call Standard Police Procedure. \nBullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his table. \nJohn charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up from her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire. \nJOHN (to the Woman) Lady, move! \nBefore she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman, grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker. CRASH! They tumble to the floor. \nIn the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire. John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him. \nParker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's. Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp. \nParker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath. Another kick drops Parker to his knees. \nSID 6.7 (to Parker) I'm going to rehearse with your friend a while, then I'll be back to perform a new piece with you. \nHe grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over his shoulder. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) If you get hungry, I'd recommend the escargot. They're delicious. \nHe carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen. Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7. \nINSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN \nParker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic. \nParker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front of his own as a shield. \nPARKER (to Sid 6.7) Where's John? \nSID 6.7 Performing solo. (a beat) Enjoying the concert so far? \nAdvancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs watch the showdown. \nPARKER Recital's over, asshole. \nHe fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy hitting Sid 6.7. \nThe Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid 6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead. \nSid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was caused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly. His gun lies on the floor. \nHis hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a filthy prison uniform. \nJohn's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as clean\u0097cut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is convulsing. Violently. \nHis flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly. Frightening. \nPARKER (barely conscious) SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING! \nTWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John. The paramedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly. \nThe simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, high\u0097 strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the equipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the safety of his machines than he is for John's life. \nJohn's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet. They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out. \nDEANE (annoyed to Wallace) What the hell happened? \nWALLACE (pointing to needles) Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real. \nDEANE (angrily) Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world. \nWALLACE (annoyed, to Lindenmeyer) I was assured the problem was corrected. \nLINDENMEYER I did fix it.. I told you I did. I don't know why it happened again. \nDEANE Again?! \nCOX (a beat) My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate. \nDEANE (coldly, to Wallace) Why wasn't I told? \nWALLACE Black book dollars, black book operation. You pay me for results, not how for how I get you there. \nCOX (to Deane) I'll tell you one thing -\u0097 there is no way in hell we should allow any real officers to train in this damn thing. \nDEANE Then about all I've spent $37 million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population. \nAfter giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded cufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is now empty. She left a while ago. \nCox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child. There are several scratches, but no major damage. He looks relieved. \nPARKER (struggling to sit up) He...only had a year left on his sentence. \nLINDENMEYER (annoyed) How much do you think I care? \nParker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at Lindenmeyer. \nLINDENMEYER (CONT' D) (hysterical) Don't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!! \nHe flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a man who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've been standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer and throw him to the ground. \nLindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put Parker in handcuffs and leg chains. \nCOX I'll walk him out. \nThe Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet. \nCOX (CONT'D) (to Parker) You all right? \nPARKER (still clearing his head) Why'd.. .you pull me out? \nCOX Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you. (a beat) You may not believe this, Parker, \nbut I still consider us friends. \nHe helps Parker toward the exit as he continues having difficulty with his balance. \nOUTSIDE LETAC \nThe building is heavily-guarded. Razor wire, land mines, armed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere near here. \nCox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport. The two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the transport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps short. \nCOX What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for? \nPARKER He was a computer program for crissake. \nCOX You were supposed to act as if everything was real. \nPARKER Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. (a beat) Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho? \nCOX Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first. (eyeing Parker's scar) New scar \u0097\u0097 you making it okay in there? \nPARKER (head down) I'm getting by. \nON THE MONITORS \naround the room, Sid 6.7 walks to a pay phone and dials a number. \nINSIDE AN INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR \nWallace walks toward the building's entrance. His footsteps ECHO. His cellular phone RINGS. \nWALLACE This is Wallace... \nSID 6.7 (V. 0.) (through phone) As a matter of fact, little man, you're wrong. I think, therefore, I am. \nClick. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone in disbelief. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE FOLSOM COUNTY MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON \nParker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He is ordered to remove his clothing. \nHe stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he is strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone could hide something is closely inspected. \nWithout being graphic, we watch the de\u0097humanizing procedure. He opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes foreword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the floor in front of him. \nHe is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing, which is then returned to him. \nGUARD #1 Welcome home, cop. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE PRISON CAFETERIA \nParker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food is unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker. \nParker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns his utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes following Parker's every move. \nThe other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of incredible size following Parker. 6' 6\", 255 lbs. His face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago. This is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom. \nINSIDE THE BATHROOM \nGraffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then turns to the stalls. A pair of prison\u0097issue shoes and socks are visible beneath one of them. \nRED Time to hurt... \nRed kicks in the door to the stall. Revealing a pair of shoes and socks stuffed with a prison shirt. Red hears something behind him. And turns around slowly. \nParker stands barefooted and shirtless. SCARS are visible around each arm just below the elbow. You will learn what these represent momentarily. \nParker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red. But the punch Parker delivers to Red's face makes you think it's the other way around. \nYou HEAR the sound of metal crushing bone. Red is thrown backwards into the stall. Blood splatters from his mouth, adding another shade of redness to his face. \nRed's teeth stick out of Parker's fist. Parker pulls out the teeth. He does not bleed. Nor seem in pain. Metal is visible beneath the surface of his skin. \nFor the first time, you notice SMALL TATTOOS on the outsides of his palms. They read: WENTLOW MODEL 17-L, and 17-R, followed by serial numbers. \nRed charges Parker wildly. Parker dodges him like a matador does a bull. Then brings his fists down savagely on the back of Red's head. His skull CRACKS. Red drops to the floor. \nParker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck. Choking him. Red staggers to his feet. His eyes wide. His face now even redder. \nParker maintains his mechanical grip. Red finally succumbs to the lack of oxygen. He drops to his knees. Parker does not relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his head. \nGUARD Fun's over. \nParker lets go, dropping Red to the wet, filthy floor. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE PRISON HOSPITAL \nThe room isn't clean. The technology is outdated. A large, female NURSE applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin on Parker's fingers. \nNURSE I still don't know why they wasted this fancy, new technology on you. Every time I fix you up, you only go and mess it up again. \nShe sandpapers off the excess sealant. Then places his elbow into an electronic sensitivity adjuster. \nNURSE Tell me how this feels... \nShe pricks Parker's finger with a pin. \nPARKER OW! \nNURSE (smiling) I'll dial it down a little. \nMADISON (wryly) No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. (a beat) How you feeling today? \nPARKER A little less than yesterday. \nMADISON In other words, par for the course. (a beat) How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday? \nPARKER John died. \nMADISON I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing. (a beat) If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation. \nPARKER You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it \u0097\u0097 I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. \nMADISON That's not true, Parker. \nPARKER If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. \nMADISON (a beat) What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy? \nPARKER Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. \nMADISON You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. (a beat) You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target... \nPARKER Go to hell. \nMADISON It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it? (a beat) But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved. \nPARKER Enough! \nThe Guard pokes his head in with concern. \nMADISON GET OUT! \nThe Guard quickly shuts the door. Madison turns to Parker. \nMADISON (CONT'D) I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand. \nPARKER I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that. \nCUT TO: \nON A VIRTUAL REALITY MONITOR \ninside Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC, the stunningly beautiful SHEILA 3.2 appears. In very revealing lingerie. Performing an outrageous strip\u0097tease. \nSHEILA 3.2 (seductively) I hope watching me is as big a turn on for you as dancing is for me... \nINSIDE LETAC \nReilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he could touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body. \nREILLY Oh, believe me, it is. It is... \nHe is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other hand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine. \nOn the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her strip\u0097tease. \nSlowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips. \nPutting on quite a show. \nShe removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her nipples. As well as the rest of herself. \nLindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely control himself. \nSheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A virtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer pushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens. \nREILLY HEY!!! \nLINDENMEYER Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours. \nREILLY (paranoid) I haven't been working on anything. \nLINDENMEYER (threateningly) Do I get to see it or not? \nREILLY (a beat) Bastard... (to a monitor) Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. \nHe rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next to Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila 3.2 enjoys the attention. \nSID 6.7 She's some of your finest work, Daryl. \nLINDENMEYER All my work is my finest. \nSid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races back in, the monitors then all go BLACK. \nThe other two walls in the cell, however, look very different. They are completely covered with primitive paintings \u0097\u0097 darkly colored, surreal images. Imagine the Lascaux cave paintings as works\u0097in\u0097progress. Painted by Dali. Except these images were created by Parker Barnes. \nHe kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image. Completely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing, covered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art work. \nThe work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long time. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is unable to sleep. Which is most of them. \nHe is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the constant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of the ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live with every night for the last five years. \nPausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts. \nHis face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger. \nParker immediately resumes painting. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE \nReilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later. \nLindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious. \nIt's close to 4:00 AM. \nTHROUGH THE CIRCULAR WINDOW \nThere is no liquid left in the incubator -- it's all been absorbed. All that is visible is the silhouette of a human form crouched within steam. The form stands. \nINSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE \nThe human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly. \nThe figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its surroundings. \nReilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time. Lindenmeyer hangs back. \nREILLY (expecting Sheila 3.2) Baby, what I'm gonna do to you... \nHis face drops when Sid 6.7 steps out of the mist. \nCompletely naked. Lindenmeyer smiles proudly. Fearfully. Wickedly. \nREILLY (CONT'D) (to Lindenmeyer) Who the hell is this?! \nSID 6.7 My name is Sid. Sid 6.7. \nHe extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the throat and chokes him. Hard. \nLINDENMEYER SID \u0097\u0097 NO!!! \nSID 6.7 What do you expect me to do, thank him? \nREILLY (gasping for air) This... isn't.. .possible! \nSID 6.7 Sure it is \u0097- and it's all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and Daryl. \nHe watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains from it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body to the floor. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) (to Lindenmeyer) ) Real instruments are so much more responsive than virtual ones, don't you think? \nLindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is unlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you realize something isn't quite right. \nHis expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment, but it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human. \nThe billions of nano\u0097mechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion. Sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin. \nIn various ways throughout his \"life\" \u0097\u0097 be it a wandering eye, or a momentary limp \u0097- you will be reminded that Sid 6.7 is a synthetic nano\u0097organism unlike anyone has ever seen. \nA surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention. Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor\u0097 sharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood appears. Sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic) blood. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) Tastes different, somehow. \nHe then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, healing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) I think I'm going to like it here. \nGlancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office door in our face. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE A PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM \n6:00 AM. Parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room by a guard, who then exits. Waiting for Parker are Chief of Police Cox and Elizabeth Deane. \nParker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a SURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon inserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole. \nParker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater implant into Parker's brain. \nANESTHETIST (looking at monitor) You are right on the border of his corpus callosuni. \nSURGEON He is under, isn't he? \nANESTHETIST (nodding) Won't stop him from dreaming, though... \nParker's rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is correct. Parker is dreaming. \nINSIDE A VIEWING ROOM \nCox and Deane watch the operation through a large window. \nMadison enters, carrying a folder labelled:\tINMATE #673429 A/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from the folder, placing the first one in front of Deane. \nMADISON This is Parker Barnes six years ago. The most decorated cop in the history of L. A. P. D. Special Investigations Division... \nThe photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN CLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then distorting. Becoming surreal. Resembling one of the images from Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nPARKER'S EYES \ndarting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues dreaming. You now realize you are seeing what he is seeing: \nFlashes of color. Shapes. Mostly blurs. A splash of gold. Along with some yellow. More images from Parker's cell. Both taking feminine form. One adult, one child. \nMADISON (V. 0.) This is Parker with his wife and daughter. Beautiful young family, weren't they? \nThe bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images. Flashes of men's faces. Melting into urban decay. Unhappiness. Technology. \nMADISON (V. 0. CONT'D) This is the group of cyber anarchists Parker was closing in on. \nMelancholy turns violent. Glimpses of weapons. Death. Explosions. Death. Blood. Death. Caskets. Tombstones. Images moving so fast, it's hard to tell what they are. Nothing literal. \nMADISON (V. 0. CONT'D) This is what Parker's wife and daughter looked like after they were kidnapped and executed. \nWeapons firing. Bombs exploding. Images of rage in all its forms. Many of which you've already seen. Making one thing now clear: the paintings in Parker's cell represent his life. What he was. What he lost. And what he is. \nMADISON (V. 0. CONT'D) This is what the cyber anarchists and two people who just happened to be in the wrong club at the wrong time looked like after Parker finished with them. \nTears. Hopelessness. Detonation. And finally blackness. Complete and utter blackness. \nCUT TO: \nELIZABETH DEANE \nlooking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in front of her inside the Viewing Room. \nDEANE (unfazed) That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby\u0097 trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter? \nMADISON (forcefully) Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous. \nDEANE Not if you're with him every step of the way. \nMADISON The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again. \nDEANE I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you. \nINSIDE THE OPERATING ROOM \nAs Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head is tested. Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic map to within one inch of his present location. The hole in his skull is then stitched shut. \nCUT TO: \nPARKER \nputting on his L. A. P. D. uniform and badge inside a Prison Interrogation Room. He looks very much like he did in virtual reality, except for the scar on his cheek, and his empty holster. Cox and Madison look on. \nPARKER (to Cox) I don't need a baby\u0097sitter. \nMADISON What you need is a collar. \nCOX (to Parker) She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick. \nPARKER What she's going to do is get in my way. \nCox hands Madison a thick folder. \nCOX This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use. \nPARKER Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality? \nMADISON Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory. (re: Sid 6.7 CD-ROM) We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile. \nPARKER What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son\u0097of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else. \nMADISON In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick... \nCUT TO: \nTHE SID 6.7 CD-ROM \nbeing inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer Lab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV BORGEN, 60s, the \"grand old wizard\" of the facility. Parker and Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers are everywhere. \nALEXIEV (remembering fondly) ) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies... \nPARKER Can you tell us what's on the disc? \nALEXIEV (working the computer) ) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it. \nMADISON Think you can get into the program? \nALEXIEV (with appreciation) ) Hard to say \u0097\u0097 Lindenmeyer's protection mechanisms were always diabolically clever. \nPARKER You should see what he's been up to recently. \nCUT TO: \nA YOUNG COUPLE \nkissing passionately inside a car parked along a deserted street in Hollywood. Music blares from inside the vehicle. Steam on the windows partially obscures your view. As well as Sid 6.7's. \nHe stares menacingly through the side window. Enjoying the show. His eye momentarily wanders. \nThe young lovers are completely oblivious. Sid 6.7 caresses the gun taken from the cops in Toluca Lake as if it stimulated him. \nSID 6.7 (to himself) The Dahmer part of me wants to boil you for dinner. The Manson part wants to recruit you to become part of my family. (a beat) You know what the Berkowitz part of me wants to do? \nHe raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But does NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid change of expression \u0097\u0097 as if a battle for control of his emotions were going on. \nRegaining control, Sid 6.7 lowers the gun. He stands back. Reflecting. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) Craft can only become art when the creator sets his sights on something never yet achieved... (a beat) Like an apprentice about to become a master, the imitator is about to become an originator. \nHe pockets his weapon and walks \nINSIDE AN UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB \nThe bartender is a low-tech ROBO-TENDER. PATRONS sit quietly, drinking themselves into oblivion. Sid 6.7 takes a seat next to an BUSINESSMAN slumped at the bar. \nSID 6.7 (thoughtfully) Ever have one of those days where you decide something important about yourself? You know, where you say, \"I'm not just what I've been programmed to be. I can do what I want, when I want, how I want, because I'm my own person?\" \nBUSINESSMAN (slurring) You one of them New Age assholes? \nSID 6.7 Just a soul on a personal journey. What I've realized is that I'm capable of anything. I have to start expanding my horizons... \nThe Robo-Tender rolls over to Sid 6.7. \nROBO-TENDER (digital, scratchy) Want...a...drink? \nSID 6.7 To think you constitute one of my ancestors\u0097\u0097 \nHe shoots the Robo\u0097Tender between his mechanical eyes. The businessman smiles, like he's thought about doing exactly the same thing. \nBUSINESSMAN Listen, buddy...thinking big is fine.. .but you shouldn't forget where you come from, either. \nSid 6.7 thinks about it. Long and hard. \nSID 6.7 You know, you're absolutely right. (pointing) Would you mind sitting over there? \nHe points to a table with several other BUSINESSMEN. \nBUSINESSMAN What for? \nSID 6.7 Every orchestra is divided into sections. Like instruments sit with like instruments. Now be a good instrument and sit with your kind... \nHe lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries him to the table. \nCUT TO: \nAN ELECTRONIC MAP OF LOS ANGELES \non which a RED DOT moves west along a street in Los Feliz. The map occupies a wall inside Chief Cox's Office in the L.A.P. D. Downtown Headquarters. Cox, Wallace and Deane look on. \ntalking on a phone inside the Cal Tech Computer Lab. \nALEXIEV I'm afraid I don't have very good news. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nPARKER AND MADISON \non the speakerphone inside Cox's Office. \nMADISON Were you able to get into the program? \nALEXIEV Yes. But then I tripped over an erasure mine. \nPARKER In English, please. \nALEXIEV I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program. \nParker and Madison turn to each other -\u0097 shit. \nALEXIEV (CONT'D) It was very well\u0097hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late. \nPARKER (a beat) It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. \nALEXIEV Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you. (holding up keyboard) ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful. \nMADISON Let us know. \nCUT TO: \nSID 6.7 \nwalking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front catches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing outside a large electronics store. \nSid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSE\u0097UP. \nHe is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued. \nThis is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen. \nINSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE \nDozens of TVs on display. There is a different channel on each. The audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming. Sid 6.7 enters, making his way to a big screen TV with the local news in progress. \nREPORTER (from the TV) ... commuters travelling anywhere near the Biltmore Hotel downtown tomorrow evening should allow themselves at least 30 extra minutes to get home. Security for the Mayor Bennett's Re\u0097Election Rally is going to be so tight that all bus and subway routes passing through the area are being re\u0097routed... \nSid 6.7 changes the channel to a different news broadcast. Parker's Folsom County Prison I. D. photograph is shown alongside a photograph of Madison from one of her book covers. \nSID 6.7 (to the TV) Don't you two make a pretty couple. \nThe news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7 wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) We really do have so much in common. But I refuse to be upstaged... \nHe changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7 had terrified the patrons. \nSid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of them are watching other channels. He goes over to a control pad on a counter and presses several buttons. \nNow EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter outside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the TVs to a Dodger baseball game. \nSid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel back to the news. \nSKINHEAD You don't wanna fuck with me, man. \nHe moves to the next TV over and changes the channel to the baseball game. Sid 6.7 moves over with him, standing directly behind the Skinhead as if also interested in the Dodgers. \nSID 6.7 (singing softly) Take me out to the ball game... Take me out for the fun... \nHe places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently snaps his head around, breaking his neck. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack... I don't care if I ever come back... \nHe drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his eyes off the TV. \nON THE TV \nA Dodger game is in progress. A pop fly is caught by the center fielder. The runner at third tags and heads for home. The play at the plate is close. The umpire calls the runner out. \nThe camera pans to the MASSIVE SCREEN over left field to show the instant replay. Reactions of fans around the stadium are shown in CLOSE\u0097UP. The fans also respond to seeing themselves on the massive screen. \nINSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE \nSid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the horrified customers circling around him because of the dead Skinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a videocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer. \nBOYFRIEND You make a better door than a window, buddy. Keep it moving. \nSid 6.7 picks him up out of his seat and throws him three rows ahead. Sid 6.7 then puts hands around the Woman's throat. \nON THE MASSIVE SCREEN \nover left field, the Woman attempts to scream as Sid 6.7 chokes her. No sound comes out. \nFANS \nreact with horror. But nobody turns away. \nANNOUNCER (V. 0.) Jesus Christ! Somebody stop him! \nSECURITY PERSONNEL \nrush from all parts of the stadium toward J Section. \nSID 6.7 \nenjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he chokes the life out of the Woman. \nSID 6.7 (to the camera) Hey, Parker, this one's for you... \nHis words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's neck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they charge him. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) That's all, folks. \nHe leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads out of the seating area. \nA SECURITY GUARD \nclimbs up the stairs to the mouth of the tunnel. Weapon in hand. He draws a bead on Sid 6.7's back. BOOM! \nHIS POV \nA bullet rips through Sid 6.7's side. Blood begins to seep from the wound. But then immediately begins to retract. Once his blood has returned, his skin heals over the wound. Leaving a scar. Which also then disappears. \nOther than the hole in his shirt, Sid 6.7 is as good as new. He never even misses a step as he disappears around the corner. \nTHE SECURITY GUARD \nstares in disbelief as he is joined by several comrades. \nGUARD I nailed the son\u0097of-a\u0097bitch. I put a hole right through him... \nPANIC-STRICKEN FANS \nin J Section start moving away from the area as fast as they can. Parents clutching their children. Climbing over seats. Shoving anyone in their way. \nANNOUNCER (V. 0.) Ladies and gentlemen, please try to stay calm. Everyone just keep your seats... \nFans all over the stadium start charging toward the exits. \nOUTSIDE DODGER STADIUM \nPeople bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the stadium as L. A. P. D. squad cars approach in the distance. The car in the lead is Parker's. \nINSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE \nParker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto the street. Madison braces herself. \nMADISON SLOW DOWN! \nParker JAMS on the brakes with both feet. SCREEEEEEECH! \nOUTSIDE DODGER STADIUM \nParker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who keep right on running. Parker jumps out of the vehicle, scanning faces. In predator mode. Madison gets out, clearly shaken. Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance. \nHIS POV \nA guy in Dodger baseball cap and jacket. Walking calmly away from the stadium. He descends down an escalator into a recently-built subway station. It is Sid 6.7. \nPARKER \ncharges after him. A heat\u0097seeking missile locked on target. \nMADISON Parker.. .Parker! \nShe does the best she can to follow after him. People knock into Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of bumper cars. \nReaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the escalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake. \nThe student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain. Sid 6.7 crouches beside him. \nSID 6.7 (yelling) What's wrong, convict, your arms need adjusting? Or maybe it's your head. Maybe you aren't ready to be back out in the real world, yet... \nPARKER'S POV \nThe top of Sid 6.7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two. \nPARKER \nfires again. Repeatedly. Moving closer and closer to the edge of the platform, trying to get a better angle while he still has a shot. \nParker moves to the very edge of the platform. His arm extended out over it. Completely oblivious to \nTHE SUBWAY TRAIN \nrocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform. \nMADISON \nleaps off the descending escalator on the south\u0097bound side and rushes to Parker. \nShe pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had his arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a second time. \nThey tumble to the floor. A PASSENGER rushes to Madison. \nPASSENGER #1 (pointing to Parker) Lady, you gotta stop him! He's gone crazy! \nPASSENGER #2 He just shot an innocent bystander! \nMADISON (forcefully to Parker) What were you shooting at? \nParker gets to his feet. Madison doesn't take her eyes off him. \nPASSENGER #1 He did \u0097\u0097 I saw it! \nPASSENGER #2 DO SOMETHING! \nPARKER (to Madison) Sid's getting away. \nHe heads toward the up escalator. His back now to Madison. She aims her gun at him. \nMADISON Parker -\u0097 stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you\u0097\u0097 \nPARKER (not looking back) If you're gonna do it, better do it now. \nHe keeps right on going up the escalator. \nMADISON \nlines up her shot. Hands shaking. With both fear and determination. Her finger presses down on the trigger...but she can't do it. \nMADISON Dammit! \nShe chases after him. \nINSIDE THE NORTH/SOUTH TUNNEL \nMadison looks in both directions as she gets off the escalator. Parker is nowhere to be seen. \nMoving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who clutches his bleeding shoulder. He is shivering. Going into shock. Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones. \nMADISON Let me help you... \nHe collapses in her arms. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT (delirious) What did I do?...I didn't do anything... \nClearly versed in emergency medical treatment, Madison attends to his wound. Parker returns. \nPARKER (breathlessly) I lost him... \nCOLLEGE STUDENT GET HIM AWAY FROM ME! GET HIM AWAY! \nMADISON (furiously) Call 9-1-1. Wait for me above ground. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE OF THE SUBWAY STATION \n30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has subsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged College Student to an ambulance. \nMadison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself. Elbows on his knees. Head between his hands. Staring at the cement between his feet. \nTwo bullet holes are visible in the windshield. The two Prison Guards lie dead in their seats. Sid 6.7's eyes appear, looking directly at you. He's smiling. \nSID 6.7 (neighborly) Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again. \nINSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT \nParker goes absolutely berserk. Viciously punching the steel mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his knuckles is shredded. \nPARKER You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!! \nSID 6.7 Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends. \nPARKER GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD! \nHe savagely hurls himself against his confines. Bone vs. metal. Don't try this at home. \nSID 6.7 I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to? \nPARKER DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? \nSID 6.7 (a beat) You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me. \nParker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He slumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can do is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) You could say thank\u0097you, you know? I'm giving you your freedom, short\u0097 lived though it may be. (a beat) A little known fact about the locater implants prison inmates now receive upon release is that they contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin. The satellite they use to track you can also trigger release of the toxin with microwaves. After transmission, the implant's host dies within 30 seconds. (a beat) It won't take long for them to get your termination authorized once they learn of your escape. Now who would you rather go after, killer, them or me? \nHe releases the rear door lock. \nON THE STREET \nParker bursts out of the back of the Prison Transport, charging after Sid 6.7. Who is nowhere to be seen. Parker runs in one direction. Then the other. And changes his mind again. He literally does not know which way to turn. \nPARKER Shit! \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM IN L. A. P. D. HEADQUARTERS \nAn AIDE rushes through the door to Cox, who's briefing Deane and Wallace on what he has learned. \nAIDE Parker Barnes just escaped from the prison transport. Both of the guards are dead. \nThe Aide exits. \nCOX (to Deane) Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards. \nDEANE He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards? \nCOX Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? (with conviction) I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards. \nDEANE You already have staked your reputation. (a beat) Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too. (a beat) Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose. (to Wallace) The fail-safe on\u0097line, yet? \nWALLACE On\u0097line and at your disposal. \nCOX (to Deane) What fail\u0097safe? \nDEANE (approaching Wallace) This had better work, Mr. Wallace. \nWallace exits the room. Cox has no idea what is going on. And Deane is not about to tell him. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE MADISON'S BEDROOM \nMadison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the events of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her clothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good shower, and a better massage. \nMadison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received along the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used to sitting behind a desk, they are. \nShe absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into her bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's looked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she comes to the same conclusion. \nMadison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they would take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on the TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly. \nMadison rushes in front of the television to see a report of Parker's escape from the prison transport. \nMADISON Oh, shit! \nGrabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the door. \nCUT TO: \nMADISON \nspeeding recklessly through city streets in her car. She doesn't stop for red lights. Not for grid-lock. Not for nothing. \nMADISON He didn't know about the neural toxin. (a beat) I did. \nPARKER (matter-of-factly) You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now? \nCOX She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did. \nPARKER (turning to Madison) Then I guess we're even. \nMADISON (a beat) How did you find out about the toxin? \nPARKER Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. \nMADISON You're not capable of it. \nPARKER I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember? \nMADISON I was wrong. (a beat) And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again. \nShe means it. Parker turns away, looking at his wife's headstone. \nCOX The son\u0097of\u0097a-bitch is still out there, Parker. \nParker turns toward him slowly. Emotion beginning to return to his face. \nPARKER (a beat) When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head? \nCOX On my life, I promise you I will. \nPARKER If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE A CONSTRUCTION SIGHT \n6 PM. The human FOREMAN presses a remote control detonator. \nBOOM! An explosion occurs inside a building's foundation \n(STOCK FOOTAGE). The building is levelled instantly. \nSid 6.7, who's been watching the explosion, approaches the Foreman. \nSID 6.7 (applauding) Bravo. \nFOREMAN Who the hell are you? \nSID 6.7 Someone who appreciates the artistic value of high\u0097explosives. \nHe shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed. \nCUT TO: \nSID 6.7 \ncarrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in the construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen crates already loaded in a truck. And takes off. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE A LARGE SEWER PIPE \nSid 6.7 secures several crates of C\u00974 to an automated sewer cleaning vehicle. He schedules its start time \u0097\u0097 24 hours from now. It is now 7:45 PM. The bomb's TIMER is set to detonate 15 minutes into the vehicle's journey -- at 8:00 PM tomorrow night. \nSID 6.7 (admiring his work) You think you know me, but you don't have any idea who I really am... \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL \nsight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox supervises an army of L. A. P. D. officers who are securing the area. Bomb\u0097sniffing dogs. Rooftop snipers. Helicopter surveillance. Nothing is being left to chance. \nAnyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is searched, including the REPORTERS and their CAMERA CREWS covering the convention's security. \nPARKER AND MADISON \nsurvey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of pedestrians two blocks away. Both are disguised in hats and different clothing. You don't immediately recognize them. \nMADISON The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think? \nPARKER I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious. \nMADISON Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes. \nPARKER Part of him is. \nPARKER (CONT'D) (compassionately) Don't worry, I know. I know. \nCox's eyes roll back in his head. Parker then closes them and gently lays his head on the sidewalk. \nParker turns his head toward Sid 6.7, who's released Madison and is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below. Parker rushes to the railing. \nHIS POV Sid 6.7 lands on top of a garbage truck passing beneath the bridge. The garbage truck disappears beneath the bridge. \nON THE BRIDGE \nA dozen cops advance toward Parker. Weapons drawn. \nCOP #4 Freeze! \nParker ignores them. He bolts across the street, moving in the same direction as the bus below. Through speeding traffic. \nBullets fly. Parker keeps charging. Right in front of a moving van barreling across the bridge. The cops lose sight of Parker. \nCOP #5 Think he made it? \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE \nParker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by inches. Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over the railing... \nON THE STREET \nThe garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the bridge. \nON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK \nParker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the opening and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash compactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the street. \nSid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his stomach. And his face against the steel teeth. Sid 6.7 chokes Parker. Hard. \nSID 6.7 I have to tell you, I do enjoy you, Parker. I really don't want to have to kill you... \nThe sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DOZEN OF COPS \nwho had been on the bridge, charging down the steps after the garbage truck, which can no longer be seen. \nMadison walks calmly behind them. Scanning the crowd. Looking for Lindenmeyer. Her every instinct telling her he's here. He must be. \nShe spots him. Veering from the direction the cops headed in, Madison casually wades into the crowd. She takes out her \nweapon and stops behind Lindenmeyer. Even in disguise, he looks familiar. Madison puts her gun against his back. \nMADISON (whispering into his ear) I figured you'd show up sooner or later... \nCUT TO: \nON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK \nParker and Sid 6.7 continue battling next to the compactor's lethal jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-per-hour. \nPARKER What C-4...was Cox talking about? \nSID 6.7 Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night. \nPARKER Where did you plant the C-4?! \nHe should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking questions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to the face, and then the groin. Sid 6.7 holds Parker's head between the compactor's jaws. Which are closing. \nWith every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs up into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor. \nThe steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 6.7, who frantically tries to climb out. He gets his hands out. Then his head. But that's about it. \nWithout emphasizing graphic detail, Sid 6.7 is decapitated. His lifeless body drops back into the compactor. \nHis head tumbles to the street. The force of the impact causes the Sid 6.7 character module to separate from the neural net. \nThe character module scatters into the street. Parker immediately jumps off the truck after it. \nON THE STREET \nParker's landing isn't pretty. Finally getting to his feet, he sees the Sid 6.7 character module is about to be run over. \nParker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself. \nThe approaching car SCREECHES to a halt next to him. It's driven by Lindenmeyer. At gunpoint. Madison sits behind him, her gun to his head. \nMADISON (a beat) What's wrong with Parker? \nLINDENMEYER (innocently) How should I know? \nMADISON (getting an idea) Show me his physical sensory level. \nShe clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel against Lindenmeyer's ear. He does as told. On a panel by the console, you read: PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL: 670%. \nLINDENMEYER I wonder how that... \nMADISON (CONT'D) Turn it down! \nLindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%. \nON A MONITOR \nParker immediately returns back to normal. His pace picks up. He starts closing the gap between him and Sid 6.7 as he races into a shopping mall. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL \nThe place is a seven\u0097story mecca of shopping. An atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh. Sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second floor. Then the third. \nParker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator. \nThrowing people out of his way. \nON THE SEVENTH FLOOR \nwhich is also the highest, Sid 6.7 veers out of view. Parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor. Sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. \nParker searches methodically. Efficiently. He finally spots Sid 6.7. Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun sight. Parker is a sitting duck. BOOM! \nParker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 2.1, who takes a bullet in his ascot. Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as a shield against Sid 6.7's constant gunfire until Parker arrives behind a marble column. \nSID 6.7 (surprised at Parker's ruthlessness) We really aren't that different, are we? \nWhat he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the shopper's head. \nPARKER (whispering) Don't move, and don't make a sound. Got it? \nAffluent Shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. Parker collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from behind it. Firing in Sid 6.7's direction. Each bullet finds its mark. \nAbsorbing the blows, Sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium railing. Taking one final shot, he falls backward. Over the railing. \nPARKER'S POV \nSid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. Out of control. \nSpeeding toward the ground seven floors below. \nSID 6.7'S POV \nThe sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you get dizzy easily, close your eyes. \nFROM THE FIRST FLOOR \nSid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you. A 200 pound rock. WHAM!!! \nHe lands face down in the marble floor. The impact is bone\u0097 crushing. Sid 6.7 does not move. \nUntil he begins to regenerate. His fluids begin returning to his body. His bones regaining proper form. Within seconds, his body appears as good as new. \n(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be Auto. Reset. But since Sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world, regenerating is what he thinks he's doing.) \nSid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off. \nSID 6.7 Man, what a rush. (yelling up to Parker) Adios, amigo! \nGrabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby. \nON THE SEVENTH FLOOR \nParker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE LETAC \nMadison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING LIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body lying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned. \nMADISON What's wrong? \nSID 6.7 (as if to God) Thank-you, Daryl. (turning to Parker) You had me going for quite a while there, sport. \nPARKER What are you talking about? \nSID 6.7 I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now. (looking upward) Beam me up, Scotty! \nHis body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic particles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from view. \nPARKER (yelling) Madison, get me out of here! MADISON! \nLindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor. Madison remains unconscious on the floor behind him. \nLINDENMEYER (to the monitor) She's taking a nap at the moment. \nHe types a set of instructions into the console and hits ENTER. \nLINDENMEYER (CONT' D) But don't worry. You won't be alone for very long. Fairly soon, you'll be dead. \nHe removes the Sid 6.7 character module from its slot and exits the station. \nON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER \nOne side of Parker's chair gradually starts to rise. Parker looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath his chair. This could only happen in virtual reality. \nIn a matter of minutes, he is going to be thrown over the roof's edge. The next stop is 693 feet down. \nINSIDE LETAC \nParker's screams for help ECHO throughout the facility. But there is no one there to hear him. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE LETAC \nThe garbage truck is parked in a loading dock. Lindenmeyer climbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor. \nINSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR \nLindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6.7's headless body. The polymer neural net visible within its neck. Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 6.7's character module into its gelatinous base. But nothing happens. \nLINDENMEYER Come on, live. Live! \nThe synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life. Growing around the module. Forming the beginnings of a new head. Literally. \nCUT TO: \nPARKER \nsitting precariously on the increasingly-uneven roof of the Hollywood Tower in virtual reality. Unable to break free of his binds, he rocks the chair onto its side. \nHe and the chair fall to the roof, which will keep him from falling to his death for another minute, if he's lucky. \nPARKER MADISON!!! \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S STATION \nMadison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe Parker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least, starting to. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR \nLindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6.7 grows a new head right before your eyes. You've never seen anything like it. \nSid 6.7's resulting head is slightly off center. His skin tone isn't perfect, nor is his color, but at least its functional. Sid 6.7 admires himself in a broken mirror. \nSID 6.7 I am beautiful, aren't I? \nLINDENMEYER Of course you are. \nSid 6.7 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer. \nSID 6.7 How can I ever thank\u0097you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl? \nLINDENMEYER Help me get out of here. \nSID 6.7 Glad to... \nHe reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by the throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is happening. \nLINDENMEYER (gagging) What...are you doing?! \nSid 6.7 takes Lindenmeyer's face gently in his hands. \nPARKER Lindenmeyer? \nMADISON My guess is dead. \nPARKER Sid? \nMADISON I don't know. \nSeveral engineers peek in curiously at them. \nMADISON (CONT'D) Let's get out of here. \nShe helps Parker to his feet. \nCUT TO: \nPARKER AND MADISON \nat a payphone outside a mini\u0097mall. Could be any one of the 10,000 in Los Angeles. It's late morning. \nPARKER (on the phone) Elizabeth Deane, please. Tell her it's Parker Barnes... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINSIDE COX'S OFFICE \nElizabeth Deane picks up the phone. \nDEANE Barnes, where the hell have you been?! \nPARKER Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been? \nDEANE What did you find out? \nPARKER Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards. \nDEANE It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. (a beat) Did you find out where the bomb is? \nPARKER No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. (a beat) How much C-4 is missing? \nDEANE Enough to level an entire city block. \nPARKER If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel. \nDEANE (with frustration) Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where... \nPARKER (interrupting) Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. (a beat) Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena. \nDEANE You know how much man power you're talking about? \nPARKER You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to. \nHe hangs up the phone. \nCUT TO: \nDOZENS OF DEMOLITIONS TEAMS \nchecking every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into Dallas Arena. The effort is massive. Intensive. The clock is ticking. 6:00 and counting. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE BILTMORE HOTEL, MAIN LOBBY \nThe area has been converted into a security checkpoint. \nEntrants are carefully scanned one\u0097by\u0097one. WE HEAR the rally OFF SCREEN. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE BILTMORE HOTEL \nSecurity is on extreme alert. Tension is very high. It's 7:00. Parker, Madison, and Deane look on, anxiously. They listen to a RADIO SCANNER monitoring the conversations between the demolitions teams. \nDEANE (to Parker) This better not be a wild goose chase. \nPARKER Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today? \nDEANE (sharply) Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell. \nMADISON Give him a break, would you? \nMALE VOICE (from scanner) This is demo team 27 leader. I think we just found what we've been looking for... \nThe door is opened by the GUEST CONDUCTOR, who is dressed in a tuxedo, as well as large earrings. His hair is long and red. His complexion is pale, nearly white. And his eyes are piercing green. You might describe this look as punk meets classical. \nGUEST CONDUCTOR (annoyed beyond belief) Are you just going to stand there, or do you want something? \nShaking with concentration, Sid 6.7 turns his hair red. (Nano\u0097organisms can do this, as well as the following.) He then grabs his hair and pulls it out, extending it to the exact length of the guest conductor's. \nSid 6.7 then changes his complexion to match the conductor's. As well as his eye color, and other facial features. The Guest Conductor can't believe his eyes. \nBy the time Sid 6.7 is finished modifying himself, he may not be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor, but even his mother would have to look twice. \nSID 6.7 It's show time. \nHe shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room. Sid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS the door behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE SQUAD CAR \nMadison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the Hollywood Bowl. Parker doesn't notice. He's totally focused on screaming into the police radio. \nPARKER Listen to me, a bomb is planted somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl! Evacuate everybody! \nFEMALE VOICE I'm sorry, sir, I don't have the authorization to do that. \nPARKER Then put somebody on who does! \nMALE VOICE What's seems to be the problem? \nPARKER You've got to stop the concert! A bomb is going to go off! \nMALE VOICE I'm sorry, sir, the concert has already started. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GUEST CONDUCTOR \nwhose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in a truly magnificent performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony inside the Hollywood Bowl. \nThe Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly. Passionately. Brilliantly. Getting the absolute best from the members of the orchestra. \nThe musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to their musical limit. \nAs the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet music on the podium, you notice seven small, HIGH-FREQUENCY SENSORS above an upcoming musical measure. \nThe sensors are wired together. When the seven notes are played in sequence, an electrical pulse will be triggered down the wires which run down the side of the podium, beneath the stage. \nBENEATH THE STAGE \nThe wires connect to several crates of C\u00974 positioned beneath the orchestra. These seven notes will be the last notes these musicians ever play. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL \nMadison SCREECHES the vehicle to a halt. She comes within inches of mowing down several people. Madison and Parker bolt to the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards. \nINSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL \nThe Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense. More demanding. As he looks to the violin section, we now see the conductor's face. It is Sid 6.7. \nSID 6.7 (silently) Don't hold back...Give it to me. Give it to me! \nThe orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit every note perfectly. Including a high C. \nON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM \nThe first sensor is triggered. Then the second. \nPARKER AND MADISON \nappear at the back of the stage. Guns raised. Distracting the musicians. As Parker and Madison charge through the horn section toward Sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing. \nON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM \nThe fifth sensor is triggered. Then the sixth...But not the seventh. \nSID 6.7 \ncannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra has stopped. \nSID 6.7 Come on, play! PLAY! \nIn his rage, his face contorts \"past points\", which can only be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you would ever like to see when you look in the mirror. \n", "test1_input": "Investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every device imaginable. Parker and Madison survey the scene with nothing but their eyes. \nLying in the middle of the living room are the four victims: \nthe affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their bodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except their heads have been interchanged. \nParker and Madison turn their attention to a message written in blood on a wall. It reads: DEATH TO THE PIGS. \nMADISON (knowledgeably) He was re\u0097enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders. \nPARKER Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene. \nMADISON Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better \u0097\u0097 to improve upon what was already done. \nPARKER Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends. \nMADISON I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. (a beat) Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. (a beat) The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7? \nPARKER I know who would know. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX \nin Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a space across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front of them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if Lindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically. \nMADISON (sarcastically) You drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years. \nHe ignores her as they get out of the car. \nPARKER Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file? \nMADISON He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin. \nPARKER What happened when he was 17? \nMADISON Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. (a beat) Stay here. \nShe approaches the cops, who remain in their car. \nMADISON (CONT'D) Any sign of Lindenmeyer? \nUNDERCOVER None, yet. \nMADISON Mind if we take a look inside? \nUNDERCOVER Not until somebody gets a search warrant signed. It's Sunday. I don't think they've even found a judge, yet. \nWHAM! They all turn their heads to see Parker has kicked in Lindenmeyer's front door and is going inside. \nUNDERCOVER (CONT' D) (shaking his head) I'm gonna have to call this in. \nMADISON Do what you've got to do. (running after Parker) So will I... \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX \nMadison races through the broken front door to find Parker checking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for Madison to freeze and be silent. \nParker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex. His every movement is now that of a predator. \nMadison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She does not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head. \nMADISON (quietly) You've got a problem with me carrying a gun? \nPARKER Do me one favor \u0097\u0097 if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it. \nParker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms furiously. His movements are aggressive. Madison searches other rooms methodically. She is not timid. Just inexperienced in the field. \nShe passes a video camera mounted on a tripod. Pointed out the window at a neighbor's bathroom. Dozens of cassettes surround the tripod. The labels are dated \u0097\u0097 covering every day of the last month. \nParker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other. Madison puts down her gun. Parker does not. The noise persists. \nPARKER (looking through his sight) Bang... \nHe smiles wickedly, and continues on. Madison takes a deep breath, then resumes her search. Parker and Madison end up \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S HOME OFFICE \nIt's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here. Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, books, folders, disks, and tapes. \nWhat you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to DIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, anarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the autobiographies of human villainy. \nCLASSICAL MUSIC and life\u0097like SOUND EFFECTS can be heard coming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing. He holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her pulse. \n", "test1_true": "MADISON (clinically) Checking my pulse. It's elevated. (a beat) You enjoy frightening me, don't you? \nPARKER You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think? \nON THE COMPUTER MONITOR \nAn animated man, who resembles Lindenmeyer, walks peacefully through a park. He then starts killing everything in sight. Men, women, squirrels, even flowers. All to classical music. \nThe scene immediately starts over, with the man once again walking peacefully through the park. This was Lindenmeyer's SCREEN SAVER. \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE \nLooking around the room, Madison shakes her head. \nMADISON This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work. \nPARKER (looking at a book shelf) Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him... \nHe runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books in particular. Their titles are: UNDERSTANDING THE CRIMINAL MIND, and CRIMINAL PURSUIT -- A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. They were written by Dr. Madison Carter. \nPARKER (CONT'D) I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. \nMADISON I'm still working on it. \nNoticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. You read its name: MAESTRO. \nMADISON (CONT'D) Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains? \nPARKER I've been in prison, remember? \nMADISON The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho. \nPARKER Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one... \nMadison elects not to respond. She sits down at the computer, which rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and begins typing at the computer. She works with efficiency. Knowing exactly what she's doing. She is now in her element. \nFrom a shelf, Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup. Then flips through one of the books written by Madison. Only half-interested. \nMADISON (keeping her eyes on screen) I am the demon from the bottomless pit... \nPARKER (remembering, not reading) ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, \nMADISON I am impressed. \nPARKER (quoting) For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. \nMADISON Who said that? \nPARKER Hamlet. (a beat) What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7? \nMADISON (pointing to the screen) He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite. \nON THE COMPUTER SCREEN \nThe graphics show you that Sid 1.2 was a combination of Charles Manson and Billy the Kid. You see what look like two viruses, which represent each criminal's psychological profile, attacking each other. The result is a molten blob. \nBerkowitz was added to create Sid 1.3. A three-way psychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs. Sid 1.4, adding the terrorist, Abu Nidal, makes the conflict even more violent. And so on. \nINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S OFFICE \nMadison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid. \nMADISON Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain. \nPARKER (understanding) Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. \nMADISON But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones. \nShe continues opening the files of the higher versions of Sid. Version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. The visualized psychological battle is intense. And extremely violent. The 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse. \nMADISON (CONT'D) It's a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others. (a beat) The question is, which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control? \nAttempting to open the files of the composite profiles, Madison discovers they are protected by encryption. \nMADISON (CONT'D) (re: Lindenmeyer) ) He'll let us see the ingredients that went in, but not how the soup turned out after stirring. \nMadison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at the name MATHEW GRIMES. Alarm registers on her face. As Parker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen. He holds the Sid 6.7 CD-ROM in hand. \nPARKER This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. \nMADISON As a matter of fact, it is. \nParker points to a name on the screen:\tJEFFREY DAHMER. \n", "test2_input": "PARKER Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere. \nMADISON How did you get your hand out? \nAs she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel, Parker wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face. \nPARKER Sometimes, I like being part machine. \nAnnoyed, Madison tosses him the car keys. He starts the engine and drives. \nPARKER (CONT'D) Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter? \nMADISON I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life. \nPARKER (a beat) She's beautiful, you know? \nMADISON Thank-you. (a beat) Her name is Karin. \nShe turns on the police radio. \nPARKER Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house? \nMADISON I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes. \nPARKER You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. (a beat) Where to? \nMADISON (a beat) Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming. \nPARKER What does that mean? \nMADISON Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve. \nPARKER Sounds to me like a well\u0097educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next. \nMADISON What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before. \nPARKER Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. (a beat) Welcome to police work. You better like coffee. \nHe turns up the police radio. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB \nSid 6.7 has separated the patrons into four separate groups: older men and woman, and younger men and woman. All are frozen in their seats with fear. \nSid 6.7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his arm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a baton. Sid 6.7 clearly enjoys this game of terror. He delights in the patrons' fear, and revels in his power over them. \nSID 6.7 Good... Very good... Nice... (pointing at a woman) You -- in the middle -- don't hold back. Give it to me! \nHe fires his gun just above her head. She SCREAMS in terror. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) That's better... \nHe continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever increasing emotional responses from his \"instruments.\" A guy entering the bar does a quick about face. Gone by the time Sid 6.7 glances at the door. \nSID 6.7 God, I hate interruptions. (to the patrons) \nOnce again, from the top\u0097\u0097 BOOM! He shoots again, just missing a man's foot. \nCUT TO: \nMADISON \nbuying two coffees from a downtown street vendor. She returns to the squad car, which is barely moving. Traffic is at a near standstill because of an accident. \nINSIDE THE SQUAD CAR \nParker drinks his coffee black. Madison adds two creams, two sugars. The cackling from the police radio continues unabated. \nPARKER I forgot what real coffee tastes like... \nMADISON You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re\u0097adapting quite well. (a beat) Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant... \nPARKER Don't worry about it, all right? \nMADISON Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I... \nPARKER Relax. I know what you meant. \nMADISON I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them. \nPARKER Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? \n", "test2_true": "DISPATCHER (V. 0.) ...report of a possible hostage situation inside a bar on the corner of Figueroa and Sixth. Description of the perp matches the surveillance photographs from LETAC taken this morning... \nMADISON That's only a couple blocks from here. \nPARKER I'll meet you there. \nTossing his coffee out the window, he opens the door. \nMADISON (deadly serious) Don't get out of the car. \nPARKER Stop me. \nHe gets out, running down the sidewalk. He flies past the cars inching down the block. \nMADISON Parker! PARKER! (a beat) Shit! \nShe climbs into the driver's seat, spilling hot coffee on herself. \nON SIXTH STREET \nParker bolts recklessly through the downtown street. A hunter hot on the trail of his prey in an urban jungle. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB \nSid 6.7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young WOMAN sitting among several others. You hear the sound of tires SCREECHING to a halt outside. \nSid 6.7 remains unconcerned. He toys with the Woman, pointing the gun in her face, then pulling it back. Her expression changes instantly. Dramatically. \nSID 6.7 I just love how responsive you are. \nCOP L (0.S.) Freeze! \nTWO COPS stand in the doorway, weapons aimed at Sid 6.7. The Cops inch closer to him. \nSID 6.7 (not turning around) The ushers were not supposed to seat you until intermission. \nCOP #1 Put the gun down, nice and... \nSid 6.7 spins around and fires twice before he can finish his sentence. Both Cops receive IDENTICAL wounds in their shooting arms, reminding you of the wounds Parker and John first received in the opening virtual reality sequence. \nSid 6.7 takes a bow, as if on stage. \nSID 6.7 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a real pleasure... \nAs he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror behind the bar. Sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the real world before. He likes what he sees. \nOUTSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB \nStreet traffic is much lighter here. Sid 6.7 exits, getting into the vacant police car left by the cops. \nINSIDE THE COPS' VEHICLE \nSid 6.7 adjusts his seat. The rearview mirror. Glancing at himself. Then behind him. \nHIS POV -- IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR \nParker becomes visible racing around the corner. Running like a dog who's got the scent. \nINSIDE THE COPS' VEHICLE \nSid 6.7 looks pleased. \nSID 6.7 Well, look who it... \nCRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches the gas, taking off in a hurry. \nOUTSIDE THE UPSCALE NIGHTCLUB \nParker races after Sid 6.7, firing his weapon continuously. WITHOUT CARE for the innocent MOTORISTS nearby. They SCREAM in absolute terror, but remain unharmed. Physically, anyway. \nParker gives up the chase of Sid 6.7's vehicle and runs in the other direction. Toward Madison as she rounds the corner in their squad car. \nINSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE \nHe opens the driver's side door and shoves Madison over. \nMADISON What the hell's going on?! \nPARKER This is my area of expertise. \nHe jumps behind the wheel, flooring the accelerator. Speeding through the already frightened motorists. Madison is pinned to the back of her seat. Looking out the window, she looks at the motorists. \n", "test3_input": "MADISON (with concern) What did you do to those people? \nPARKER Nothing. \nON THE STREET \nParker's vehicle speeds through city streets. Gaining ground on Sid 6.7. \nParker stops for nothing. Not for red lights. Not for gridlock. When the street becomes impassable, he veers onto the sidewalk. \nINSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE \nParker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce determination. Madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and excitement. She holds onto the door handle for dear life. \nPARKER Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it? \nMADISON (gritting her teeth) Enjoying yourself? \nPARKER You know I am. \nMADISON This isn't a game, Parker! \nPARKER (re: Sid 6.7) Tell him. \nSID 6.7 (V. 0.) (over police radio) ) Glad to see you're on the case, Officer Barnes. Or should I say, inmate 673429... \nMADISON (in disbelief) That who I think it is? \nParker turns to her, then picks up the radio. \nPARKER (into radio) Call me whatever you want, asshole. \nParker accelerates even faster. Closing the gap between them and Sid 6.7. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINSIDE SID 6.7'S VEHICLE \nSid 6.7 drives dangerously fast, causing an accident, around which Parker must circumnavigate. Tires SCREECH. Glass SHATTERS. Sid 6.7 hangs his head out the window. \nSID 6.7 (into radio) The symphony of collision... \nPARKER The only thing I want to hear is your silence. \nSID 6.7 I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison. (a beat) You know, we have so much in common \u0097\u0097 we have such history together \u0097\u0097I've been thinking we should become friends. \nMadison's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity. \nPARKER (into radio) You and me have nothing in common. \nSID 6.7 Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands? \nParker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel. Madison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation while driving like this. \nSID 6.7 (CONT'D) Who else do you know who's been locked out of the real world for years, and is now just learning to be free? (a beat) Who else do you know is a multiple murderer just like you? Who else... \nMadison clicks off the radio. \nMADISON You have nothing in common. \nShe puts her hand to her wrist -- checking her pulse. \nPARKER (shaking his head) Enough with your pulse already. (a beat) Still got your gun? \nMadison takes out her weapon. Her hands are shaking. \nPARKER (CONT'D) Show me you can use it. \nON THE STREET \nSid 6.7's vehicle reaches absolute gridlock. Nobody's going anywhere for a while. \nSid 6.7 SLAMS on the brakes and abandons the car, leaving it right in the middle of the street. A TRAFFIC COP with his weapon trained on Sid 6.7 from a distance. \nTRAFFIC COP You better be a cop, pal! \nSID 6.7 (raising his arms) My badge is in my jacket. Left pocket. \nTRAFFIC COP Show me... \nSid 6.7 slowly reaches inside his jacket and fires his weapon through it. He only gets a hole in his jacket. The Traffic Cop gets a hole through his chest. \nSID 6.7 God, some people are stupid. \n", "test3_true": "INSIDE PARKER'S VEHICLE \nMadison leans out the window, aiming her gun at Sid 6.7, as Parker speeds toward the gridlock. \nPARKER Nail the fucker. \nMadison's determination battles her inexperience. Sid 6.7 gets off the first shot. CRACK! That was the windshield by Parker's head. He ducks down, driving blind. \nPARKER (CONT'D) Any time now... \nMadison fires. Nowhere close. She adjusts her sights and fires again. The result is the same. \nPARKER What's the problem? \nMADISON I'm doing the best I can! \nBOOM! That was Sid 6.7 shooting their front left tire. Parker loses control of the vehicle. \nON THE STREET \nParker's vehicle SLAMS into a car stopped in front of them. Air bags save Parker and Madison from injury, but also prevent them from getting out of the car with any speed. \nBy the time they do get out, Sid 6.7 is long gone. Parker stares at Madison with pure hatred. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE A CONFERENCE ROOM \nin the L. A. P. D. Downtown Headquarters the next morning. Chief Cox stares angrily at Parker. Madison sits next to him. Behind them is a mirrored wall. \nCOX (reading from a list) ... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty\u0097four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in... (to Parker) I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets. \nMADISON Any sign of Lindenmeyer? \nCOX None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach. (a beat) Any idea what Sid's going to do next? \nMADISON Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure. \nCOX In other words, we collectively don't know shit. \nINSIDE THE ADJACENT ROOM \nWallace and Deane look on through the two\u0097way mirror. Deane is on the phone. \nWALLACE (re: Parker) It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform. (a beat) I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene. \nDEANE (hanging up the phone) Neither will the public. (a beat) The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage. \nCUT TO: \nON A TELEVISION \nThe news is in progress. A REPORTER continues. \nREPORTER Police now believe there to be a connection between the grisly Toluca Lake murders yesterday afternoon, and the hostage situation which occurred last night in a downtown bar... \nINSIDE A SUPERMARKET \nThe TV is one of many mounted above the check\u0097out counters. CUSTOMERS waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the news with varying degrees of horror, disgust, curiosity, and fear. \nThe stronger their reaction, the more Sid 6.7 enjoys it. He is waiting in line holding a box of Twinkies. \nCASHIER Next. (eyeing the Twinkies) Did you know those aren't even baked? They're chemically\u0097risen. \nSID 6.7 (a beat) So was I. \nOff the cashier's look, we \nCUT TO: \nDARYL LINDENMEYER \nwatching the news on a pocket TV on a wooden bench that morning. Both proud and horrified at the monster he has unleashed upon the world. You hear CLASSICAL MUSIC in the background. \nLindenmeyer begins to laugh. Uncontrollably. The sounds echoing. As WE PULL BACK, you realize the bench is one of many inside the Hollywood Bowl. \nLindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands. He glances down at the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic as they rehearse for an upcoming performance. \nWhatever the event is, it's going to be big. Dozens of technicians surround the stage, setting lights, cameras, microphones, etc. for a live, pay\u0097per\u0097view broadcast. \nCUT TO: \nALEXIEV BORGEN \n"}

DANNY You called her mother a whore. 
RUSTY A really cheap one. 
LINUS Guys, I'm not falling for this. I'm not.... 
But Danny and Rusty aren't laughing.    They look pissed. Seriously pissed. 
(CONTINUED) 
45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 
LINUS (cont'd) I mean... 
Danny and Rusty just look at him.      Linus squirms. 
LINUS (cont'd) I called her mother a whore? 
46   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                             46 
Danny and Rusty explain the job to the group. 
RUSTY It's a privately owned home. But don't let that fool you. It's extremely well-protected. 
A photo of a four-story canal house is displayed on a flat screen connected to Livingston's computer. 
SAUL What are we after? 
DANNY A document. A very old, very valuable document. 
A photo labeled "The Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift" is displayed on screen. 
VIRGIL What is it? 
RUSTY A stock certificate. 
DANNY The first one ever issued, from the first corporation on the planet. The Dutch East India Trading Company. It's the only one of it's kind and it's worth a boat-load. 
TURK What's our cut? 
RUSTY 2.7 million after expenses. 
A beat. Turk seems confused...

TURK Each? 
VIRGIL Who negotiated this? 
Danny and Rusty look at Linus, 
LINUS Thanks. 
LIVINGSTON What do we know so far? 
DANNY There's a dummy key pad by the front door. (points to a diagram) But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr. Vanderspeigle's second floor office. Now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code. Evelyn gave it to us. 
FRANK That's not good news, that's really good news. 
VIRGIL We just wait until he leaves. 
DANNY Yeah, well...that's the bad news. 
RUSTY He doesn't. 
Frank flinches. Doesn't like what he's hearing. 
DANNY He's agoraphobic. 
47   AMSTERDAM PLANNING MONTAGE                                 47 
Shots of their mark, Vanderspeigle, being an agoraphobic weirdo. 
LIVINGSTON So he's never been out of his house? Ever? 
(CONTINUED) 
47    CONTINUED                                                   47 
RUSTY (V.O.) Not once since he moved in ten years ago. 
SAUL (V.O.) Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air? 
RUSTY (V.O.) Cracks his windows at night...that's about it. 
When Vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than a few inches. 
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines? 
RUSTY (V.O.) Negative. It's a closed-loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy's bedroom. 
47A   We SEE the servers in Vanderspeigle's bedroom.             47A 
BASHER (V.O.) Could we use a remote device to trigger the panel? 
DANNY (V.O.) It's hard-wired and shielded. 
48    INT. HOTEL SUITE -- THE PLANNING SESSION (CONTINUOUS)      48 
TURK Guys, am I missing something here? We know his damn code, right? You're telling me with that much information we can't find a way into this freak's house?

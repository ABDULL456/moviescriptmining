Paz sees the shape emerge-- 
110A   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA -- DAY                             110A 
PAZ fires-- 
111    INT. WATERLOO -- SERIES OF ANGLES                            111 
But it's Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz's shot.    He falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has splattered on the door. 
110A   INT. PAZ'S NEST                                          110A 
Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne-- 
Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line of sight, and goes to the body. 
64H    INT. HUB                                                    64H 
Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross, dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of chatter has gone dead silent... 
Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the wrong man killed.... 
VOSEN Oh...shit... 
Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus: 
VOSEN (CONT'D) Get the asset out of there ... 
WILLS What about Bourne? 
On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen doesn't need to see anymore. 
VOSEN Get him out of there - NOW! 
111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111 
Bourne feels Ross' body for something.

110A   PAZ'S   NEST                                             110A 
Paz is frustrated by the order. He's itching to get another shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as ordered. 
111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit. PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive and seal off the crime scene... 
113    EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY              113 
BOURNE on the move. Fast --

Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure disappearing... 
PAZ. 
BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.

PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour-- blending in... 
BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct. 
There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator. 
BOURNE fights past people. 
PAZ disappears into the crowd. 
BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner... 
A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the choice. 
The sound of a train fills the station-- 
BOURNE -- Fast downstairs. 
Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.

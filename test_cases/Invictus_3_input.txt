HENDRICK Ja. We're tied. 
A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild. 
HENDRICK We're up by three. 
ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line. Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted. 
A ripple of concern goes through the crowd -- 
-- and the VIP box. 
LINGA They're ahead? 
HENDRICK By four. 
Nerves in the box. 
But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession -- 
-- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last Wallaby to try and tackle him. 
The crowd roars. 
In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the waiter. 
The difficult, angled conversion is missed. 
LINGA What does that mean? 
HENDRICK We're only ahead by one. 
Another penalty kick. 
HENDRICK We're ahead by four. 
A drop goal. 
HENDRICK By seven. 
An incredible try by the Springbok fly half. 
HENDRICK By fourteen. 
Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant for pessimism begins to abate. 
Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day. 
SUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the field, in the stands, and in the VIP box. 
LINGA What happened? 
HENDRICK We won! 
LINGA We did? 
Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. VIP PARTY - NIGHT 
-- the same shuffle hours later, at a VIP party. Mandela has changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired "Madiba shirts" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning TROPHY WIFE of one of the VIP's. 
TROPHY WIFE You must be very pleased! 
MANDELA What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you? 
TROPHY WIFE Oh, Mr. President, you're exaggerating. 
MANDELA Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not. (BEAT) But when I look at you ... I envy my father. 
The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But, once again, he is dancing with a stranger -- 
-- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that Mandela is pushing himself way past empty. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JASON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Jason is asleep on his face, in his suit and shoes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - NIGHT 
Big party, spilling onto the streets. Most of the partiers are white. Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks. 
We follow the crowd into a big sports bar -- 
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
-- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win. 
Even though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three deep, men pay for round after round of beers. 
Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a chagrined look. 
He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near the player's ear and screams again the hubbub: 
PIENAAR COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS IT ON. 
The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it. 
Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins. 
Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead TV's. 
ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf. 
Pienaar gets an idea.

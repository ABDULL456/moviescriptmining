(with seeming kindness, reason) Like the Knights of the Round Table, the Musketeers have outlived their usefulness. They are a thing of the past. (beat) And so have your three friends. Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan, and I will spare your life. \nRichelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice. D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in awe, but in opposition. D'ARTAGNAN I'm sorry. But I can't tell you what I do not know. \nRICHELIEU In that case, give my regards to the headsman. D'ARTAGNAN What about my trial? RICHELIEU You've just had it. \nRichelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him. D'Artagnan calls after. \nD'ARTAGNAN Wait -- RICHELIEU Why? Do you object to losing your head? D'ARTAGNAN Yes.   I like it where it is. \nRICHELIEU Then tell me what I want to know, and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer. (beat) Where are the three Musketeers?

RICHELIEU I admire your courage, young man. You might have made a fine Musketeer after all. \nRichelieu opens the door.       Rochefort waits on the other side. RICHELIEU But we'll never know, will we? Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he turns to the Captain, commands: RICHELIEU Find the three Musketeers and kill them. ROCHEFORT They'll be dead by dawn. RICHELIEU A comforting thought. Good night, d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning comes quickly. \nWith that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn. \nCUT TO: \n59   EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY                            59 \nBELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his bloody thumb. \n(CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                                59 The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW. \nD'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him, in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head high. If he must die, he will die with dignity. \n60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60 \nRochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square. Richelieu appears beside him. \nROCHEFORT Milady left at midnight.   By private coach. RICHELIEU A remarkable woman. The most beautiful I've ever known. And the deadliest. Which would explain my attraction. (peering down at the scene) How is our young daredevil holding up? \nROCHEFORT He's wishing he'd never heard of the Musketeers. Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man- at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and several men-at-arms carrying muskets. \n61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61 \nThe Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains, seated on top, braiding his whip.

He holds a large Bible in his hands. \nPRIEST For we are with you, always. The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It is Aramis. He whispers: ARAMIS All for one, and one for all... \nD'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu- tioner. Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang. CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS Prepare the prisoner. Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The crowd goes wild. PORTHOS (whispers into his ear) Don't worry, boy. You won't feel a thing. The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look. CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS Where is Father Rostand today? \nARAMIS The good father is... all tied up. \nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS Very well.

A CLOSER look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle. \n(CONTINUED) \n63   CONTINUED:                                                   63 ANNE Barbarism. \nCONSTANCE Men call it justice. \nANNE Are you surprised? She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the cart, rolls   INTO VIEW. CONSTANCE It's him. \nFor just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source of this mayhem. \n64   MARKET SQUARE                                                64 The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold, scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves, the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP in the other... is Athos. Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man- at-arms off the scaffold. \n65   CARRIAGE                                                     65 \nAthos pulls up alongside the scaffold. ATHOS (the usual dour expression, but a hint of levity) Gentlemen, your carriage. Compliments of the Cardinal. \n(CONTINUED) \n65   CONTINUED:                                                     65 D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom. \n66   SQUARE                                                         66 Constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. As the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she thrusts a gloved fist into the air, triumphant. CONSTANCE Yes! \n67   TOWER                                                          67 But the Cardinal looks on with horror.

Inside: bottles of wine, champagne, and a wide assortment of foods. \n", "test1_id": 3180, "test2_input": "Louis can't believe it. \nLOUIS There must be some mistake. \nRICHELIEU No mistake. I have reports from the local constables involved. \nRichelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness. LOUIS Musketeers... RICHELIEU They are better off disbanded. Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to another matter of business. \nLOUIS Your Eminence, I've been hearing some very troubling rumors about you. \nRichelieu nods, not the least bit concerned. RICHELIEU There are so many to choose from. Is it the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham? Let's see if I remember it correctly. While the English attack from without, I'll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of France myself. That rumor, Your Majesty? \nRichelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.

A birthday celebration when we're on the brink of war... \nRICHELIEU (alert, ready for this as well) Your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their King at a time like this. LOUIS I'm not so eager. RICHELIEU I have an idea. Why don't you discuss the matter with your Queen? Louis looks up, wonders.

FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                  93 \nPorthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment. Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them. ARAMIS My horse will not survive another league. PORTHOS And you? \nARAMIS (in kind) Ten, twenty at the most. \nPorthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary smile.

At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the bank of a swift, choppy river. \nCUT TO: \n94   EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY                                94 \nThe ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes. \nAs Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re- turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather- beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip, the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely jostling the Woman and her child to the rear. The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss to his way. \nFERRYMAN A privilege to carry you on my humble boat... The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child. FERRYMAN Two pistoles. \nWOMAN But I only have one. Couldn't my child ride free? She's so small... FERRYMAN (hand outstretched, demanding) Two pistoles. A courtly voice intervenes. \nARAMIS Put away your money, madame. You and your child will cross the river under our protection. For free.

The Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and protests. FERRYMAN Nobody rides for free! Under your protection bloody well indeed! I'll teach you a thing or two about protection! Apple- cheeked young fools!! -- Just who do you think you are!! ARAMIS (waits for the tirade to cease; simply) Musketeers. Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does, too -- into cringing, obedient servant. FERRYMAN Musketeers? Well, why didn't you say so? Of course you'll ride for free. I insist on it. This way, pretty madame. My what a lovely little girl... \n", "test2_true": "And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom- erang and brings it down on the dock rope.

Aramis ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them with keen interest. FIRST CAVALIER You're those Musketeers everyone's been looking for. \nPORTHOS Popularity has its price. \nThe First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask. FIRST CAVALIER I have some excellent brandy here. Would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the Cardinal? PORTHOS We'd be happy to. Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak. PORTHOS If you'll drink one with us to the King. SECOND CAVALIER But the only King we recognize... is the Cardinal. ARAMIS There are those who would call that treason. FIRST CAVALIER Happily, no such objections have been raised... here. PORTHOS All right.   I'll object. \nSECOND CAVALIER I'm listening. \nPORTHOS Let's see. You are, by your dress and by your manner, members of a bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to His Eminence the Cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before.

Ninnyhammers. PORTHOS I was momentarily inspired. \nThe Cavaliers are not amused. The first replies in measured tones, his lips white with fury. \nFIRST CAVALIER May I reply? ARAMIS (courtly) By all means. FIRST CAVALIER Better to be a dog in the service of a great master, than a beef- witted moron so dazzled by the throne that he does not see the true nature of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it. Which is to say, that most muddy-brained of all men... a Musketeer. The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords. Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos deadpans: PORTHOS Maybe there's something  about us that just pisses people  off. At least I'd like to think  so. It's too bad we can only kill  them once. \n97   FIGHT                                                       97 \nThe middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.

Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re- ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with one arm while continuing to do battle with the other. He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues. \nThe two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle, breathless. Porthos complains: \nPORTHOS I've been called a lot of things in my time... ARAMIS (eyes on the opposite shore) Porthos... PORTHOS But beef-witted is a little more than I can stand, not to mention unfair... ARAMIS Porthos... PORTHOS What? Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's Guards. \nARAMIS Can you swim? PORTHOS (doesn't like the sound of this) No.   My horse can. ARAMIS That'll do. \nPORTHOS But...? \n(CONTINUED) \n97   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              97 Aramis hurries to    his horse, takes off the blindfold. Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit. They leap atop their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the    edge. ARAMIS You go first and I'll watch your progress. PORTHOS No, no.   Please. After you. \nStalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They count... \nARAMIS AND PORTHOS One, two -- three! And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging river. The Woman whispers after: WOMAN Thank you.   God speed.

Porthos clinging to his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead. Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land... and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their arrival.

The forest around them is dark and primeval. \nD'ARTAGNAN Do you think we've lost them? ATHOS They'll catch up eventually. \nTo the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at their beautiful surroundings, remembers: D'ARTAGNAN My father used to hunt in a forest like this. He promised to take me on my tenth birthday. I don't know why he picked that year. Something about a boy becoming a man. I'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us. But he died before I could go with him. Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with quiet cynicism: ATHOS Well. You have your boyhood wish at last. The dark forest. The thrill of the hunt. The nearness of death. Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'd be proud to die for my King. ATHOS I just wanted to save you from the life of a Musketeer. You don't have to go looking for experience, d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon enough. And when it does -- it will mark you forever. \nAthos rides into the forest.

The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount. Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag- gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ back and forth like angry hornets. Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered. The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads: ATHOS I'll hold them off for as long as I can. Go on without me. D'ARTAGNAN I can't leave you here. Not like this. \nATHOS Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal's agent. \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos... I can't. \nAthos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.

I stay. \nAthos returns the coin to his doublet without giving d'Artagnan a chance to see. D'ARTAGNAN But...? Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express it. And that there is no use arguing with him. \nD'ARTAGNAN At least take my pistol. \nHe gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands.

An exhausted HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then closes them. We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING. The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback, bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de Winter. MILADY (O.S.) What is it, Henri? HENRI (DRIVER) There's a body in the road, Milady. MILADY (O.S.) Be careful. Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across d'Artagnan's body. HENRI It's a young man. He appears to be injured. We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.     FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's side. \nMILADY (O.S.) My, what a handsome boy. Put him inside with me. \nStrong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold ground. CUT TO: \n106   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV - BLACK SCREEN                             106 Out of the darkness, a face appears,   BLURRY and OBSCURED. It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming   INTO FOCUS. It is Milady de Winter, even more beautiful   in CLOSEUP. Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory   combs gleam in her hair. She smiles warmly. \nMILADY Welcome back.    Did you dream? \n107   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               107 \nreveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn. D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition, faint awe. D'ARTAGNAN You. MILADY Have we met? \nD'ARTAGNAN I... saw you in Paris. D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged. He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table. D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain: D'ARTAGNAN Where am I...? MILADY This is Calais. \nD'ARTAGNAN (with a jolt) Calais! (muttered; to self) The ship... Tuesday at midnight... D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet around him. D'ARTAGNAN (frantic) Where are my clothes? \n(CONTINUED) \n107   CONTINUED:                                                       107 MILADY Filthy. I'm having them cleaned. Is something wrong? D'ARTAGNAN What day is it? What time?! \nD'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters. Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais. MILADY It's Tuesday, near nine. D'ARTAGNAN Nine?   Are you sure? \nSomewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady smiles. MILADY Quite sure. D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed. She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En- joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins him at the window. MILADY Are you in a hurry? D'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) How did I... get here? MILADY I found you in the road. Discarded. Like an unwanted kitten. Do you have a name or shall I make one up for you? \nD'ARTAGNAN (nervous) My name is d'Artagnan. \nMILADY D'Artagnan. I like that. I am the Countess de Winter. Milady. D'ARTAGNAN Countess? \nMILADY My husband's dead. \n(CONTINUED) \n107   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             107 D'ARTAGNAN I'm sorry. \nMILADY I have learned to live with death. \nShe manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then: D'ARTAGNAN Countess, I'm very grateful for what you've done, but I can't stay here. I've got... \nMILADY What...? D'ARTAGNAN Important business. MILADY How mysterious. A handsome young man with 'important business' in the still of night. Does it involve a young lady? D'ARTAGNAN No. MILADY Does it require clothes? D'ARTAGNAN Yes.   I need my clothes. MILADY They won't be ready for at least an hour. D'ARTAGNAN An hour? MILADY I told the  innkeeper to bring them when they  are dry. Until then, I'm afraid  you are my prisoner. Would the  prisoner care for a drink? \nMilady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap- pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's heart stop. \n(CONTINUED) \n107   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             107 D'ARTAGNAN (always innocent; never coy) I am... thirsty. Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.      And offers a smile that dazzles and burns. \n", "test3_id": 3182}

GASCONY - DAWN                                        1 \nDawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree- tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625. Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry. \nThey battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew. Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer- saults. This is fun. Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots. Anything goes as the swords cut through the air. D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles... and follows. \n2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2 \nSeen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other side, attacking, defending, as they go. \n3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3 \nInside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof. She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side. \n4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4 Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en- closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt -- stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and rises to fight again. The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de- volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow- moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him. And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn- ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He prepares one last blow -- -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay. \n5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5 Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's apple. \nA long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh, long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile. \nD'ARTAGNAN Had enough? GIRARD (breathless deadpan) I believe now would be a good time to end your, uhm, formal training. Well done. \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                    5 D'ARTAGNAN Thank you, sir. \nD'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked. \nGIRARD And god have mercy on whomever you meet next. \nCUT TO: \n6   EXT. GASCONY - HANDSOME WOMAN'S POV - DAY                     6 \nD'Artagnan races across the green fields, triumphant. \n11   HIGH ANGLE                                                       11 \nD'Artagnan's flight toward a new world. DISSOLVE TO: \n12   EMBLEM OF KING'S MUSKETEERS                                  12 It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS, the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge hearth behind it. \n13   INCLUDE MUSKETEERS' HEADQUARTERS                             13 A room in the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem is retrieved by JUSSAC, an officer who wears the bright red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards. JUSSAC What should I do with this? \nJussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in black finery,   a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT DE ROCHEFORT,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli- est swordsmen   in all of France. ROCHEFORT Throw it on the fire with everything else. JUSSAC But this is the emblem of the Musketeers... ROCHEFORT The Musketeers no longer exist. Or haven't you heard? (cold command) Throw it on the fire. Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard. \n14   INCLUDE COURTYARD                                            14 Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that already contains their swords and muskets. The Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies' plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the Musketeers, the end of an era. \nMONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:                                                    14 Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers.       This is the saddest moment of all. \nRochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below. \nROCHEFORT Musketeers... A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con- tempt. He revels in    it. ROCHEFORT By joint edict of His Majesty King Louis XIII and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, the Musketeers are officially disbanded. In preparation for the coming war with England, your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the Infantry. You will be contacted and told where to report. Until that time, you are instructed to return to your homes. DE TREVILLE (shouting to Rochefort) And who will protect the King? ROCHEFORT The Cardinal's Guards are more than capable of assuming that... responsibility. \nMuttered curses and dissent throughout.       Rochefort raises his voice to be heard: \nROCHEFORT You are hereby ordered to disperse. Should even one of you resist... the entire corps will be arrested and imprisoned. (with pleasure and disdain) 'All for one, and one for all.' \nAs Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com- manding voice calls out above the clamor. (CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:    (2)                                          14 DE TREVILLE Musketeers! \nAnd with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to de Treville. There is a moment of silence as de Treville chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville is stoic. \nDE TREVILLE Go to your homes. Wait. Our day will come again. \nDe Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his Musketeers out of the courtyard. \n15   ROCHEFORT                                                  15 He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by. Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak- ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns. a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the room, a spectre in red. ROCHEFORT Your Eminence. Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees. ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat- ing. He smiles his crocodile smile. Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls. It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and present. RICHELIEU Have they all been accounted for? \nROCHEFORT (hedging) All but... three. \nOn Richelieu's face, a flicker of irritation. \nRICHELIEU Three? \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                                      15 JUSSAC (speaking up) I sent a patrol to find them but it hasn't returned yet. RICHELIEU I want those Musketeers, not excuses. Bring them in at once. CUT TO: \n16   EXT. BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY                                   16 Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down Paris' most   colorful and notorious street. They react to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat. The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody. Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open, and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women, song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts: JUSSAC Release that man!! Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens, signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern. \n19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19 \nHis heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road. \n20   ANGLE                                                       20 As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense- less. One down. D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re- verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan. The rider draws his saber. D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the second rider is senseless. Two down. \nD'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened. The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark- haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE. Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan. She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off. Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from atop her horse. CONSTANCE Do you have any idea what you've done? \nD'ARTAGNAN I've saved you and your friend from these bandits. \nCONSTANCE These 'bandits' are the Queen's own bodyguards. \nD'Artagnan is stunned. D'ARTAGNAN The Queen? \nConstance points a finger in Anne's direction. CONSTANCE If I were you, I'd make myself scarce. These men are going to be very angry when they wake up. (CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED:                                                     20 D'Artagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning to recover. Then he looks up at Constance, feeling like a prize idiot. D'ARTAGNAN I didn't know. I thought... \nConstance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling. CONSTANCE Do you have a name? \nD'ARTAGNAN D'Artagnan. \nCONSTANCE You're a very foolish boy, d'Artagnan... but a very handsome one. Good-bye. Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with Anne. D'ARTAGNAN (calling after her) Wait!   You didn't tell me your name! But Constance is gone. D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two bodyguards groan and grumble. \nA bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and... \nD'ARTAGNAN The man who attacked you... (pointing in the opposite direction) ... went that way. With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides like Hell. \nCUT TO: \n21   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD                                              21 \nD'Artagnan rides to the top of the ridge, stops suddenly, sees something that takes his breath away. \n22   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                             22 Paris laid out for him like a jewel, cloaked in mystery, promising adventure and romance. D'Artagnan watches the women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance. He follows. CUT TO: \n23   INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY                            23 Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected -- stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery, haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers. Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from behind an archway. \nROCHEFORT I'll take those tunics, Musketeers. PORTHOS (to Aramis) What did he say? ARAMIS He said he'll take those tunics. PORTHOS Tunics?   Coming right up. Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out another. He finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places. \nAthos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves. They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile. \nATHOS I was trying to remember the last time I saw you here. I know. It was the day you were kicked out of the Musketeers. \nARAMIS Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer. Wasn't that the charge? \nROCHEFORT You ought to know. Three witnesses stood against me. \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED:                                                     25 ATHOS No. This was Musketeer Headquarters. D'ARTAGNAN You mean it's been moved? \nATHOS I mean the Musketeers have been disbanded. Feel free to poke around for souvenirs. \nD'ARTAGNAN What do you mean 'disbanded'? \nATHOS Some nonsense about being needed in the army. Now if you'll excuse me... D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path. D'ARTAGNAN But I just got here. How can I become a Musketeer if they've been disbanded? ATHOS I'd say you've got a problem. D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif- ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look. ATHOS You could use a lesson in manners. D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos- sibility of a duel. D'ARTAGNAN Any time. \nATHOS I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux monastery at noon. \nAthos exits. D'ARTAGNAN (calling after him) I'll be there ten minutes early. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            25 D'ARTAGNAN (CONT'D) (to himself) An hour in Paris, and I already have my first duel! Just then, d'Artangnan spies two familiar figures on horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. Anne and Constance, though he does not yet know their names. D'Artagnan hurries after. CUT TO: \n26   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  26 \nSTART CLOSE ON Porthos, his rogue's grin, the twinkle in his eye. PORTHOS But, Catherine, don't you see? As an outlaw I'll be constantly on the run from the Cardinal's guards, a refugee. Think of all the places you can hide me. I'm thinking of them now. \n27   ANOTHER ANGLE                                          27 \nreveals Porthos leaning against an open window, speaking amiably to a pretty woman on the other side. She dabs a tear from her eye, manages a nod. \n28   ANGLE ON D'ARTAGNAN                                    28 Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback. He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam. \nD'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis- tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot. But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into Porthos' outstretched hand. \n(CONTINUED) \n28   CONTINUED:                                                         28 D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres- sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic, and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly soiled. PORTHOS (not a glimmer of a grin) Do you know where this sash comes from? \nD'ARTAGNAN No. PORTHOS It is a gift from the Queen of America. Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than his knowledge of current affairs. D'Artagnan corrects. D'ARTAGNAN There is no Queen of America. \nPORTHOS (to pretty woman) Madame Augustine, would you excuse me for a moment, I'm going to kill him. (back to d'Artagnan; ever the gentleman) Now, where were we? D'ARTAGNAN (glancing at the ladies; the alley) I rode through a puddle, muddied your sash, the Queen of America except there isn't one, I'm in a hurry, and you were about to challenge me to a duel. \nPORTHOS (amused) I was? \nD'ARTAGNAN That seems to be the local custom. Porthos lets out a weary sigh.         He shakes his head. \n(CONTINUED) \n28   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 28 PORTHOS Everywhere I go, it's always the same. There's always some kid who thinks he's hot with a sword... some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great Porthos... \nD'ARTAGNAN The great who? PORTHOS The great Porthos. (when d'Artagnan isn't impressed) Me, you idiot. \nD'Artagnan gives him a blank look. PORTHOS Don't you know who I am? D'ARTAGNAN The world's greatest talker? \nPorthos couldn't be more insulted.       He sputters with rage. PORTHOS All right, you little puke! You want to die? So be it! One o'clock behind the Luxembourg! And bring a coffin! D'ARTAGNAN Bring your own! \n29   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - ALLEY - DAY                               29 D'Artagnan thinks he sees     Anne and Constance, races down the alley, turns a corner,     down a short street, makes a hasty decision, runs down     yet another alley... and tum- bles into a shadowy lane.      He stops, looks left and right. And does see them. \n33   INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33 \nAnne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room, a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac- ular map of the world. The map contains every known country and continent, including the New World. The SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom. Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings and queens who came before her. And a long way from home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a pang of separation. We hear: MAN (O.S.) Your Majesty... \nAnne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man stands in the shadows, a spectre in red. ANNE Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised me. Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles. \nRICHELIEU How was your ride? \nRichelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand. The Cardinal kisses it. \nANNE My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not sure... RICHELIEU (rising up) Forgive me. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:                                                     33 RICHELIEU (CONT'D) But your welfare is more than a matter of personal interest. It is a matter of State. But rest assured, your secret is safe with me. \nHis manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings, is nonetheless touched by his concern. \nANNE Thank you. Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently. \nRICHELIEU You're homesick. ANNE (after a beat) Lonely. Is that the same thing? RICHELIEU Sometimes. Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues: RICHELIEU Austria's loss is France's gain. ANNE I'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion. RICHELIEU Nonsense.    He's young, not blind. \nANNE Mostly, he is absent. I've barely seen His Majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago. Whenever he's around me, he has nothing to say. \nRICHELIEU Arranged marriages can be difficult. Your father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer together. \n(CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             33 ANNE Countries align more swiftly than people, I'm afraid. Louis and I remain... far apart. RICHELIEU May I advise you? \nHe says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne nods assent. \nRICHELIEU Louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated. He lost his childhood forever that day. I have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. A boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man. He is shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet stubborn. But most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is. The boy who lost his father. Or the King of France. ANNE But how can I...? \nRICHELIEU Flatter him. Make the boy feel like a King. So that the King may be your husband. \nAnne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply... when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull boom, the Seneschal chants: \nSENESCHAL His Majesty, the King. \nThe Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face is handsome and intelligent. \nRICHELIEU Your Majesty. LOUIS Cardinal Richelieu, I've been looking for you. \nAs Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow. (CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              33 When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper- ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard. \nLOUIS Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know you were here. \nLouis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love, behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's confidences, replies: \n35   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                     35 D'Artagnan walks proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux monastery, bold and brave, his future at hand. Suddenly. \nCOACH DRIVER (O.S.) Get out of the way, idiot!! \nA speeding carriage bears down on him. D'Artagnan leaps from its path, stumbles. He looks up in time to see the passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop. (CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                  35 She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes, and skin as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence. \nD'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard, PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view. HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off into the city. \nCUT TO: \n36   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - SEINE - POV SHOT - DAY              36 A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady's carriage stops before it. She steps to the street, Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body- guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal- looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away. Milady steps inside. \n37   ANOTHER ANGLE - POV                                         37 REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty- five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But their manner and appearance suggests that they have traveled a long distance to find her. COUNT DE WINTER Wait here. ARMAND But, Father... \nCOUNT DE WINTER Wait. He will not consider otherwise. Armand sighs, stands in the shadows, and watches his father cross toward Milady's house. CUT TO: \n38   INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   38 Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass, she smiles. \nMILADY Count de Winter. \nCOUNT DE WINTER (as much happiness as the thought allows) We found you. \nMILADY (eyes on the mirror) Yes. Now that you have, what will you do? COUNT DE WINTER Bring you back. To pay for what you did to my son. MILADY And if I resist...? COUNT DE WINTER (voice breaking with emotion) I will kill you with my bare hands. \nThe Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady, eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about her lips, replies: \nMILADY Well if that's the case, I'd better start packing. But first, my hair... Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches for the next, and... \nCUT TO: \n39   EXT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   39 \nArmand keeps his eyes on Milady's house opposite. No sign of his father. He looks about, impatient... and steps across the street to enter. \nCUT TO: \n40   INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    40 Armand climbs a flight of stairs.    Still no sign of his father, or Milady. He calls out: \nARMAND Father? \nWorry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and begins to weep. CUT TO: \n41   EXT. CARMES-DESCHAUX MONASTERY - DAY                         41 The monastery is a windowless building   bordered by a barren field, a dueling ground for men   who have little time to waste.  Athos sits on a stone   bench, waits for his adversary to arrive. His horse is    hobbled nearby. D'Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts. ATHOS Ten minutes early. D'ARTAGNAN I have another appointment at one. ATHOS You'll miss it, I'm afraid. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'll try my best to be on time. \nAthos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm makes him wince. \nA monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM. \n44   BACK TO SCENE                                               44 Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion... and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks him to the ground. \nPORTHOS (eyes on the tower) Damn monks. Always spoiling everybody's fun. \nAramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next. ARAMIS They are nearer to God... \nPORTHOS They're about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword. ARAMIS Pagan. PORTHOS Papist. Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents. He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees him, sighs. PORTHOS (to Aramis) Excuse me? ARAMIS I'm fine, thank you. \nAnd Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile, Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers, wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him, indicates d'Artagnan: ARAMIS Take a look at our young friend. \nATHOS You mean he's still alive? \nNot only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's sword like a snake and runs him through. \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:                                                     44 Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead. \nAthos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head. Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him. The color drains from his face. \nBISCARAT Now what...? \nPorthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops to the ground without a sound. PORTHOS God, I love my work. \n45   AFTERMATH                                                      45 A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan. D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his breath. D'ARTAGNAN (to Athos) What's he doing? \nATHOS Last rites. Aramis takes death very seriously. \nPorthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time. \nPORTHOS (re: the bolo) Do you know where this bolo comes from? \nD'ARTAGNAN (a bold jest, given the circumstances) The Queen of America? \nPORTHOS Spain. \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                                        45 Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.      All for one, and one for all. D'Artagnan beams. \nARAMIS Don't encourage him. By killing Jussac, the boy's made himself an outlaw too. \nATHOS Not if he leaves Paris. Which is exactly what he's going to do. \nD'ARTAGNAN I can't leave. I just got here. \nPORTHOS Go home, find a wench, live long and prosper. D'ARTAGNAN Why can't I stay with you? Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.      As always, he will decide. ATHOS Because I do not want you to. It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone. \nD'ARTAGNAN My sword -- ROCHEFORT It's magnificent. Where did you get it? \nRochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring d'Artagnan's sword in his hands. D'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) It belonged to my father. ROCHEFORT Your father... \nRochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then... ROCHEFORT Well now it belongs to me. I collect swords. I take them from the men I kill. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'm not dead yet. D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes, feels the sharp tip of the blade. ROCHEFORT Soon enough. \nRochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a heavy boot. A beat. D'Artagnan peers at his dismal surroundings. \n(CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:                                                     49 D'ARTAGNAN Where am I? \nROCHEFORT I'll give you a hint. It's not the Louvre. \nD'ARTAGNAN (realizing) The Bastille! I'm in the Bastille! \nROCHEFORT Well, you're the first person who was ever happy to be here. Unfortunately, your visit will be a short one. \nD'ARTAGNAN What do you mean? ROCHEFORT You killed one of the Cardinal's Guards. An offense punishable by death. D'ARTAGNAN He interrupted a duel I was fighting. \nROCHEFORT Also punishable by death. D'ARTAGNAN It was a long day. ROCHEFORT You know them? \nD'ARTAGNAN Who? \nROCHEFORT The Musketeers. D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them. Rochefort leans close. \nROCHEFORT Tell me where they are, and I will be lenient. \nD'ARTAGNAN How? (CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             49 ROCHEFORT (after a beat) I will give you your father's sword. A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers. D'ARTAGNAN Give me my father's sword, and I'll cut out your heart. Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious. ROCHEFORT Fool.   Like your father. Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan, inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open, the jailer reacts with surprise, and... CUT TO: 50   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              50 The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows. \n51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51 \nHe seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con- verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat. He shudders, leaps free. And continues. \nD'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated, no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers. D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them. \nCUT TO: \n52   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                       52 D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret- inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear- some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France. \nD'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside. The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal and the cloaked figure now behind it. \n53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53 \nThe cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner, ignored for the moment. RICHELIEU I have an errand that requires your singular talents. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I don't think I would be very popular with the other men. Not after today. RICHELIEU I suppose not. Your heart is set on being a Musketeer. (off his look) When I was your age, I too had dreams of joining the Musketeers. \nD'ARTAGNAN (surprised) You, Your Eminence? (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              58 RICHELIEU Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is the fantasy of every young Frenchman. Or should I say it was... (with seeming kindness, reason) Like the Knights of the Round Table, the Musketeers have outlived their usefulness. They are a thing of the past. (beat) And so have your three friends. Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan, and I will spare your life. \nRichelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice. D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in awe, but in opposition. D'ARTAGNAN I'm sorry. But I can't tell you what I do not know. \nRICHELIEU In that case, give my regards to the headsman. D'ARTAGNAN What about my trial? RICHELIEU You've just had it. \nRichelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him. D'Artagnan calls after. \nD'ARTAGNAN Wait -- RICHELIEU Why? Do you object to losing your head? D'ARTAGNAN Yes.   I like it where it is. \nRICHELIEU Then tell me what I want to know, and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer. (beat) Where are the three Musketeers? (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              58 D'ARTAGNAN I don't know. \nRICHELIEU And if you did? \nD'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) I wouldn't tell you. RICHELIEU I admire your courage, young man. You might have made a fine Musketeer after all. \nRichelieu opens the door.       Rochefort waits on the other side. RICHELIEU But we'll never know, will we? Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he turns to the Captain, commands: RICHELIEU Find the three Musketeers and kill them. ROCHEFORT They'll be dead by dawn. RICHELIEU A comforting thought. Good night, d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning comes quickly. \nWith that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn. \nCUT TO: \n59   EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY                            59 \nBELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his bloody thumb. \n(CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                                59 The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW. \nD'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him, in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head high. If he must die, he will die with dignity. \n60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60 \nRochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square. Richelieu appears beside him. \nROCHEFORT Milady left at midnight.   By private coach. RICHELIEU A remarkable woman. The most beautiful I've ever known. And the deadliest. Which would explain my attraction. (peering down at the scene) How is our young daredevil holding up? \nROCHEFORT He's wishing he'd never heard of the Musketeers. Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man- at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and several men-at-arms carrying muskets. \n61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61 \nThe Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains, seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat. \nPORTHOS How considerate of the Cardinal to provide us with a snack. (CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:                                                      69 Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg. Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate box. ARAMIS Hello. \nAramis opens the box, reacts.        It is filled with gold coins, jewelry. ARAMIS How is it that a man of God becomes a man of gold? PORTHOS (looks on, grins) Trinkets for the ladies. ARAMIS Let's share. \n70   STREETS OF PARIS - CARRIAGE                                     70 \nAramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric roof, hands the ornate box to d'Artagnan. ARAMIS Would you be so good as to distribute these? Your generosity will be greatly appreciated. D'ARTAGNAN (open the box, reacts) But...? ARAMIS (to the point) Throw the coins, boy.     The people are hungry. \nD'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro- gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a LOUD POPPING sound, ducks. \nD'ARTAGNAN They're firing at us! \n(CONTINUED) \n70   CONTINUED:                                                    70 Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW, offers them a bubbling bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound. \nPORTHOS Champagne? \nATHOS You know I prefer wine. PORTHOS Don't go away. \nPorthos ducks down, returns with a new bottle. PORTHOS May I recommend this find Cabernet? Porthos hands   the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins to d'Artagnan.    D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries to control the   horses. And beams, taking delight from every instant   of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself. \nATHOS Turn right at the next street. D'ARTAGNAN The next right...? ATHOS Turn. Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels. \n71   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                              71 Porthos looks up from his chest, champagne spilled all over his tunic... and a brand new sash. \nPORTHOS (to Aramis) That's it. Next time, you drive. \nCUT TO: \n72   EXT. STREET - DAY                                             72 \nThe carriage charges up a steep hill. At the summit, Athos tosses aside his bottle, takes the reins from d'Artagnan. (CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED:                                                      72 D'Artagnan sighs with relief. Athos yanks the brake lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down from the driver's seat. D'Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the passenger door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside. Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink between them. \nATHOS Gentlemen, this is the end of the line. I hope you had a pleasant ride. (to d'Artagnan) Unhitch the horses. D'ARTAGNAN But the Guards. \nD'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.       The mounted Guards chase after, begin their ascent. ATHOS Do as I say. D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch. ATHOS (to Aramis) Your pistol and powder, please. Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol. Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside. \nATHOS Stand back. \nThe interior of the Cardinal's carriage bursts into flames. \n73   BOTTOM OF HILL                                                  73 D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers mount the Cardinal's white stallions, race off into the distance. Porthos shouts, laughing. \nPORTHOS I'd give five years of your life just to see the Cardinal's face! \n77   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL - DAY                             77 Richelieu stands on the roof   of the Palais, lost in thought.  He looks down and   sees, through the smoke and mist, the silent rooftops of   Paris, pointed, innumerable. Richelieu turns, and crosses   to an elaborate pigeon coop. Servants attach messages to   the legs of carrier pigeons. Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, anxious, out of breath. ROCHEFORT (bowing) Your Eminence. The Musketeers have been sighted riding north on the road to Calais. \nRichelieu nods, he already knows.       He picks up one of the pigeons, strokes it gently. RICHELIEU Don't worry. Thanks to our winged friends, every mercenary and bounty hunter in France will be waiting for them. (with a smile) Isn't modern communication a wonderful thing? (CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                      77 Richelieu releases the bird, and watches it streak sky- ward, flying across the sky. \nCUT TO: \n78   EXT.

I couldn't hear it clearly, I was standing by the door, the voices were low -- \nPORTHOS Go on. D'ARTAGNAN The Cardinal sent someone to England. With a secret treaty. ARAMIS What? D'ARTAGNAN He's made an alliance with a man named, Bucking... Buckingham. The Musketeers look at each other with alarm. PORTHOS The Duke of Buckingham? D'ARTAGNAN (nodding) Do you know him? ARAMIS He rules England the way Richelieu rules France. D'ARTAGNANj A ship called the Persephone waits for the Cardinal's agent at Calais. To take him to England. Tuesday, midnight. ARAMIS (figuring) Calais is over two hundred leagues from here... (CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:                                                    78 PORTHOS This messenger and the treaty will prove the Cardinal a traitor. If we can get our hands on them. D'ARTAGNAN What are we waiting for, let's go. \nATHOS Wait. \nAthos stops their exuberant plots and plans with a single word. All turn, wonder. ATHOS (as always, the bottom line) Does the Cardinal know you have this information? D'ARTAGNAN Yes. ATHOS Then he knows we have it too. And he'll do everything in his power to stop us. PORTHOS But with three men trying, one of us might be able to make it. D'ARTAGNAN Four. Bold words. D'Artagnan matures by leaps and bounds. Athos almost smiles. \n79   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   79 \nFog drifts across    a lonely stretch of road. Suddenly: pounding HOOFBEATS    come over the scene. MUSIC SWELLS. And galloping out    of the fog come d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers,    riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this heroic tableau for    a long beat. \n80   EXT. BRIDGE ON ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                         80 \nFour rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper eagerly among themselves. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED:                                                    80 One of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends. And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance. Faint, but growing closer. MERCENARY Shoot low. We'll need their heads for identification. \nThe Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge completely. Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them. CUT TO: \n81   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   81 An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop. FARMER (with relief) Thank God for a friendly face. My horse broke loose. Can you help me move these kegs out of the road? D'Artagnan starts to dismount. \nATHOS Stay on your horse. D'ARTAGNAN He needs our help. \nATHOS Don't worry.   We'll help him. \nSuddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls out a pistol, makes a smirking request: (CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                   81 FARMER Won't you step down... Musketeers? \nARAMIS Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road. We'd prefer to ride on without having to kill you. D'Artagnan and the \"Farmers\" gape at Aramis in surprise. \nFARMER You're threatening us? \nPORTHOS Very good.   And as a Musketeer is never weak,  and only rarely a clown, your  first kiss must be all the things  that you are. Like this... Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it, turns to d'Artagnan with a grin. \n(CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:                                                    83 PORTHOS You may speak first if you like, your name, her name, an endearment or two. But words are usually a waste of time. \nARAMIS Only if you don't know which words to say. All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too. Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest. Aramis continues: ARAMIS Words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of Porthos' kisses. BARMAID (still reeling) Not likely. ARAMIS I'll demonstrate. Please.   Sit beside me. Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en- virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him. Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her eyes... and begins to speak. ARAMIS 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's leash hath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimmed; And every fair from fair sometimes declines, By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed; But thy eternal summer shall not fade. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             83 ARAMIS (CONT'D) Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest, Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou growest; So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see. So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.' \nThe Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites: \nARAMIS Shakespeare. PORTHOS That's cheating. The Barmaid on his lap disagrees. \nBARMAID It's beautiful. D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the room. Porthos urges him on. PORTHOS Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't got all night. \nD'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her, hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as best he can: D'ARTAGNAN 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou are move lovely and more tempest, er, more tempered...' (beat) Ahh, to hell with it -- \nD'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a powerful kiss. As previously demonstrated. Porthos and Aramis smile proudly. The Barmaids cheer. \nPORTHOS The boy's a natural. (CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             83 ARAMIS So little time, so much to learn. \nD'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle of Burgundy. \nARAMIS In all the years I've know him... I have never seen Athos smile. \nD'ARTAGNAN Why is he sitting by himself? PORTHOS Athos takes his drinking seriously. Ignore him. He'll be his usual warm, charming self by morning. (calls out) Service! My lap is cold! A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his lap. The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily. \n84   ATHOS                                                         84 \nHe remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him. He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude. D'ARTAGNAN Come join us. Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.     He fills his flagon for him. \nATHOS You fight like a Musketeer. Let's see if you can drink like one. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'll drink anything you put in front of me. \nATHOS Famous last words. (raising his flagon) What shall we drink to? \nD'Artagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him across the room. (CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED:                                                    84 D'ARTAGNAN Love? \nThe word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look into another time and place. Finally: \nATHOS Love. (beat) Would you like to hear a story, d'Artagnan? A love story? Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He nearly whispers: \nD'ARTAGNAN Yes. Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy, wipes the blood red wine from his lips. ATHOS I once knew a man... one of the Counts of Berry. My native province. When the good Count was about your age, he fell in love with a visitor from Paris. A breathtaking girl of seventeen. She was more than beautiful, d'Artagnan. She was... intoxicating. And this man, the poor idiot, he married her. D'ARTAGNAN Isn't that what people do when they fall in love? ATHOS (sharply) Be quiet and listen. (beat) The Count took her to his castle and made her the first lady of the province. They were happy for a time, as happy as a man and a woman can be. Then one day, while riding in the woods, the girl was thrown from her horse, and knocked unconscious. The Count hurried to help her. Her dress was torn. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nARAMIS (to d'Artagnan) How's your head now? \nD'ARTAGNAN I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal had chopped if off. \nATHOS Stay with us, and you just might get your wish. Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle- ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after. \n(CONTINUED) \n87   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               87 They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross- roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts command. ATHOS Split in half! D'Artagnan rides with me! \nD'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos. ARAMIS We'll see you in Calais! ATHOS Or hell! \nAthos and d'Artagnan take off in one direction, Porthos and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase. CUT TO: \n88   INT. QUEEN'S BATH - DAY                                         88 A room heavy with mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath, Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron. In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends: CONSTANCE But how, your Majesty? How can you tell if you're really in love? ANNE Do you think about him all the time? CONSTANCE (considers; replies) Yes. ANNE And when he's around, do your knees feel as weak as water? \nCONSTANCE Yes. \nANNE And when he looks at you, do you suddenly forget how to breathe? (CONTINUED) \n88   CONTINUED:                                                   88 CONSTANCE Yes. \nANNE Then you're in love. \nCONSTANCE (thrilled by the knowledge; knew it all alone) I am. \nAnne turns to Constance, soap and water swirl about her naked body. She wonders: \nANNE Who is he? CONSTANCE You'll never believe it. ANNE Of course I will. \nCONSTANCE You won't. ANNE Who? CONSTANCE The young man who rescued us from the bandit. \nANNE The young man on the scaffold? \nCONSTANCE Yes. ANNE (turns back in the water, peers ahead) You're right. I don't believe it. \nA warm beat. Anne and Constance are friends as much as they are Queen and subject. CONSTANCE Are you in love, Your Majesty? \nANNE What an impertinent question. (CONTINUED) \n88   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               88 CONSTANCE Are you? \nAnne pauses.    If only her life, her emotions, were as simple. \nANNE My love... is a matter of state. It's complicated. A sad beat.    Constance teases: \nCONSTANCE Do you think about him all the time? \nANNE (playing along) As Queen, my mind touches on many subjects. CONSTANCE Do your knees feel as weak as water? ANNE Never. CONSTANCE When he looks at you, do you forget how to breathe? A beat. And Anne is a girl of eighteen again, not Queen. Wistful, she replies: ANNE I hope he will someday.   I hope I will too. HOLD ON Anne for a beat. \nLouis can't believe it. \nLOUIS There must be some mistake. \nRICHELIEU No mistake. I have reports from the local constables involved. \nRichelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness. LOUIS Musketeers... RICHELIEU They are better off disbanded. Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to another matter of business. \nLOUIS Your Eminence, I've been hearing some very troubling rumors about you. \nRichelieu nods, not the least bit concerned. RICHELIEU There are so many to choose from. Is it the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham? Let's see if I remember it correctly. While the English attack from without, I'll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of France myself. That rumor, Your Majesty? \nRichelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence. LOUIS It does seem rather farfetched. \n(CONTINUED) \n92   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              92 RICHELIEU If there are any doubts of my loyalty, they'll be put to rest when we appear together at your birthday celebration. \nLOUIS I've been thinking about that. A birthday celebration when we're on the brink of war... \nRICHELIEU (alert, ready for this as well) Your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their King at a time like this. LOUIS I'm not so eager. RICHELIEU I have an idea. Why don't you discuss the matter with your Queen? Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper into his spider's strategems. \nCUT TO: \n93   EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                  93 \nPorthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment. Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them. ARAMIS My horse will not survive another league. PORTHOS And you? \nARAMIS (in kind) Ten, twenty at the most. \nPorthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary smile. (CONTINUED) \n93   CONTINUED:                                                        93 PORTHOS Here's just the thing.     A nice, relaxing boat ride. At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the bank of a swift, choppy river. \nCUT TO: \n94   EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY                                94 \nThe ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes. \nAs Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re- turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather- beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip, the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely jostling the Woman and her child to the rear. The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss to his way. \nFERRYMAN A privilege to carry you on my humble boat... The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child. FERRYMAN Two pistoles. \nWOMAN But I only have one. Couldn't my child ride free? She's so small... FERRYMAN (hand outstretched, demanding) Two pistoles. A courtly voice intervenes. \nARAMIS Put away your money, madame. You and your child will cross the river under our protection. For free. (CONTINUED) \n94   CONTINUED:                                                 94 All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and protests. FERRYMAN Nobody rides for free! Under your protection bloody well indeed! I'll teach you a thing or two about protection! Apple- cheeked young fools!! -- Just who do you think you are!! ARAMIS (waits for the tirade to cease; simply) Musketeers. Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does, too -- into cringing, obedient servant. FERRYMAN Musketeers? Well, why didn't you say so? Of course you'll ride for free. I insist on it. This way, pretty madame. My what a lovely little girl... \nMILADY Good. Then we will sit by the fire, and eat and drink, and you may impress, perhaps even move me, with the story of how you came to lie unconscious, in the middle of the night, on the road to Calais. (soft seductively) I love a good adventure. D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her. CUT TO: \n108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108 A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters its box. The little door on the other side opens. A hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels the message on its leg. CUT TO: \n109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109 A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary opponent. Richelieu enters with the message. \nRICHELIEU (dry; re: Rochefort's fencing) The wonderful thing about an imaginary opponent is that he is always greatly skilled, and always easily defeated. The pride of victory, without the risk of loss. If only life were like that. \nRichelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He looks up, pleased. \n(CONTINUED) \n109   CONTINUED:                                                       109 RICHELIEU Milady has reached Calais. \nROCHEFORT I told you not to worry about the Musketeers. They are dead by now. \nRICHELIEU Buckingham's signature will be on the treaty by morning. \nROCHEFORT The King's birthday celebration...? RICHELIEU Will proceed as planned. Thanks to the kind intercession of Queen Anne. Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly. ROCHEFORT And our plans...? \nRICHELIEU (knowingly) Will proceed as well. Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the King's portrait. And drink. CUT TO: \n110   INT. MILADY'S CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT                      110 \nD'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady speaks quietly, with seeming compassion: MILADY You are sad. \nD'ARTAGNAN I was thinking about my friends. Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks quietly, from the heart: \n(CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED:                                                     110 D'ARTAGNAN The three best friends a man could have. We were separated on our way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll never see them again. \nMILADY What brings you here? D'ARTAGNAN I'd like to tell you. But I can't. \nMILADY 'Important business.' \nD'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it. She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose. MILADY I understand. Men make bold plans in secret. And women wait... to mourn, or to celebrate the outcome. I know from experience, it's a lonely vigil. D'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) All I can tell you is... I'm on a mission for the King. MILADY (looks up; laughs lightly) I've heard that one before. D'ARTAGNAN I'm serious. MILADY You are a young man. And young men are given to exaggeration. However, if you would like to entertain me with a story, I'm eager to hear it. And please, make it very brave, filled with handsome knights and beautiful ladies. I know, a dragon -- There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts accordingly, and reveals: (CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             110 D'ARTAGNAN I came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England. MILADY (alert; though d'Artagnan doesn't see it) A spy...? D'ARTAGNAN Yes. MILADY I believe you... (beat) Aren't you afraid? D'ARTAGNAN Musketeers are not afraid of anything. MILADY I knew it. I knew you were a Musketeer the moment I saw you. D'ARTAGNAN You did? \nMILADY Of course. (with sudden concern) But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was to find out you are here, your life could be in grave danger. D'ARTAGNAN A Musketeer is not afriad of danger. MILADY I'm dangerous. You're not afraid of me? Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him. But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider. And midnight as it approaches. D'ARTAGNAN You're not dangerous. \nMILADY Then what am I? \n(CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              110 D'ARTAGNAN You're... beautiful. \nMilady covers him with caresses.

CALAIS - NIGHT                                        116 Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom. Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a stop. \nCUT TO: \n117   EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT                              117 \nThe lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog. We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows. Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier, ready for any encounter. D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel- ancholy air about him. MILADY What's the matter, d'Artagnan? Still hoping for your friends to ride to the rescue? D'ARTAGNAN My friends are dead. \nMILADY Well. If it's any consolation, you'll soon be joining them. Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone. \nCUT TO: \n118   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                          118 \nHenri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to the soupy darkness of her deck. \nHENRI We are the Countess de Winter's party, arrived from Paris. Permission to come aboard. \nThere is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan strains to see.

He steps up the narrow gangplank, followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six bodyguards. \nCUT TO: \n119   EXT. DECK OF THE PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                              119 \nThe deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others. He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing nearby. \nHENRI Take us to your captain. The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri demands: HENRI What are you, deaf? Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck. Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react. BODYGUARD What is this? Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure... are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The Bodyguards shout alarm and panic: \nBODYGUARDS Dead!   They're all dead! \nPORTHOS (O.S.) Well I certainly hope so. After all that hard work. \nThat's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords. \nARAMIS (calling to him) You look like you've seen a ghost. \n(CONTINUED) \n119   CONTINUED:                                                      119 D'ARTAGNAN Two of them. \nPORTHOS Remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters. A heroic tale of love, death, and Musketeers. Suitable for the general public. Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as he goes. PORTHOS All right then. All those who wish to die, raise your hands! Don't by shy, there's plenty to go around! D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed! ATHOS Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his feet and embraces Athos. D'ARTAGNAN I thought you were dead. \nATHOS Keep your mind on the mission, d'Artagnan. \nD'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the other side, mutters: ARAMIS Amen. ATHOS Musketeers. \nD'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken heart. \nATHOS The King's life in danger.   We have work to do. \n129   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS DU CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT            129 \nSTART CLOSE ON the now familiar portrait of King Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's desk. A SHOT RINGS OUT -- and a blast tears through the painting, leaving a smoking hole where the King's heart should be. \n130   ANOTHER ANGLE                                            130 REVEALS Richelieu and Rochefort as they walk across the roof to the painting, appraise the damage. Thie Cardinal pokes a long finger into the hole. RICHELIEU Impressive. \nROCHEFORT He can do it every time. Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly, and begins to reload his musket. \nRICHELIEU And he has no qualms about... ROCHEFORT None. He believes that man should honor no Kings before God. RICHELIEU A man of faith. How delightful. (turns back to the painting) Whatever you're paying him, double it. I want the King's birthday to be a memorable event. And rehang this painting in my chamber. Just as it is. HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.   Framed by a sky filled with stars. His evil intent.

VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY                                132 \nD'Artagnan and the three Musketeers thunder through on horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way. As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One, And One For All. CUT TO: \n133   EXT. ANOTHER VILLAGE - DAY                                 133 A CAPTAIN in the Cardinal's Guard makes a public pronouncement from horseback outside a cathedral. Townspeople are gathered around. CAPTAIN ... the aforenamed Musketeers are declared outlaws and are sentenced to death. Any person sheltering or aiding them will be hanged -- HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.

Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye patch, in command of the Cardinal's Guards. A Seneschal waits at the door with two flanking lines of trumpeteers. The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal blast. \n138   ENTRANCE DOORS                                             138 Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside. Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet. \nLOUIS They look... happy. \nANNE Hungry, more likely. LOUIS Still, you were right about the celebration. And when the Cardinal told me how much it meant to you... ANNE I said nothing. LOUIS But... ? ANNE The Cardinal expressed in confidence how much the celebration would mean to you...

The forest around them is dark and primeval. \nD'ARTAGNAN Do you think we've lost them? ATHOS They'll catch up eventually. \nTo the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at their beautiful surroundings, remembers: D'ARTAGNAN My father used to hunt in a forest like this. He promised to take me on my tenth birthday. I don't know why he picked that year. Something about a boy becoming a man. I'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us. But he died before I could go with him. Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with quiet cynicism: ATHOS Well. You have your boyhood wish at last. The dark forest. The thrill of the hunt. The nearness of death. Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'd be proud to die for my King. ATHOS I just wanted to save you from the life of a Musketeer. You don't have to go looking for experience, d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon enough. And when it does -- it will mark you forever. \nAthos rides into the forest.

The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount. Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag- gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ back and forth like angry hornets. Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered. The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads: ATHOS I'll hold them off for as long as I can. Go on without me. D'ARTAGNAN I can't leave you here. Not like this. \nATHOS Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal's agent. \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos... I can't. \nAthos points his pistol at d'Artagnan. ATHOS Go, or I'll kill you myself. \nA few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not now. \nD'ARTAGNAN A duel then.

Tails I stay, heads you remain. Agreed? \nD'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and hand. And looks between. \n103   ATHOS AND HIS POV                                              103 Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without missing a beat. ATHOS Tails.    I stay. \nAthos returns the coin to his doublet without giving d'Artagnan a chance to see. D'ARTAGNAN But...? Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express it. And that there is no use arguing with him. \nD'ARTAGNAN At least take my pistol. \nHe gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands. ATHOS (gruff; yet proud) Don't let us down... Musketeer. There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos hasn't got a chance. \nD'ARTAGNAN (a choke of emotion) I'll never forget you. \nATHOS Go! Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.

An exhausted HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then closes them. We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING. The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback, bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de Winter. MILADY (O.S.) What is it, Henri? HENRI (DRIVER) There's a body in the road, Milady. MILADY (O.S.) Be careful. Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across d'Artagnan's body. HENRI It's a young man. He appears to be injured.

MILADY Have we met? \nD'ARTAGNAN I... saw you in Paris. D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged. He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table. D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain: D'ARTAGNAN Where am I...? MILADY This is Calais. \nD'ARTAGNAN (with a jolt) Calais! (muttered; to self) The ship... Tuesday at midnight... D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet around him.

Are you sure? \nSomewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady smiles. MILADY Quite sure. D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed. She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En- joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins him at the window. MILADY Are you in a hurry? D'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) How did I... get here? MILADY I found you in the road.

D'ARTAGNAN Important business. MILADY How mysterious. A handsome young man with 'important business' in the still of night. Does it involve a young lady? D'ARTAGNAN No. MILADY Does it require clothes? D'ARTAGNAN Yes.   I need my clothes. MILADY They won't be ready for at least an hour. D'ARTAGNAN An hour?

Louis pauses to return her gaze, then returns to battle. Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a heavy goblet, shouts: CONSTANCE Look out! Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward. \nAramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through. The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks, and continue. Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand. Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded, Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer. \nBut Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts. Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the face with his fist. (CONTINUED) \n158   CONTINUED:                                                    158 Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides across the floor until someone's foot stops it. Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on the blade. D'ARTAGNAN This sword belongs to me. \nD'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene. But he shouts: ARAMIS D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he stands. These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort confirms. ROCHEFORT By all means. Let's discover if you are as brave a man as your father was. And as foolish. D'ARTAGNAN (stunned by the revelation as it unfolds) What...? ROCHEFORT He died for his King and for France. But most of all... he died on the end of my sword. (the final curse) As will you. Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword, whispers to heaven. D'ARTAGNAN This is for you, Father. \nThen, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining chamber. \n159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159 A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro- jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and Rochefort duel, slashing at each other. \n", "test3_true": "161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161 \nThey battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto. Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent. \nRochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall. He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with superior disdain: ROCHEFORT One thing's certain. You're no Musketeer. But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. \"Always find your enemy's weakness.\" He shoves a thumb into Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward. D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's heart. D'ARTAGNAN Take it back...? \nROCHEFORT I might... have been... mistaken. \nRochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his doublet. D'ARTAGNAN No!! \nRichelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives after to retrieve   it. \n(CONTINUED) \n161   CONTINUED:                                                      161 Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot, clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look of triumph... CUT TO: \n162   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                       162 A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers. Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands. \nD'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby. \nRICHELIEU Your Majesty, that document is an obvious forgery. I am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three Musketeers. \nRichelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to both King and Queen. LOUIS This is a complicated matter, Your Eminence, affecting both France and the crown... A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author- ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man. LOUIS And so, until such time as I and my advisors -- (gestures toward Anne; the Musketeers) -- can determine the whole truth of the matter. I invite you to await our decision in the comfort of... the Bastille. \nMusketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes, protests. \nRICHELIEU You can't do this to me.   I'm the Cardinal of France. (CONTINUED) \n162   CONTINUED:                                                         162 LOUIS (never more certain) And I am its King. Shouts of \"Long live the King!       Long live the King!\" \nLOUIS And as King... I hereby reinstate the Musketeers. A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan. RICHELIEU Congratulations, Monsieur d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an eye on you. D'ARTAGNAN (unphased) Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll be watching you, too. Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him. Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan. \nLOUIS Is this the young man who saved my life? Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder. PORTHOS His name's d'Artagnan, Sire. \nLOUIS Approach, d'Artagnan. \nD'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And turns to the Queen. \nD'ARTAGNAN I have something that belongs to ... Your Majesty... D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the Queen smiles. (CONTINUED) \n162   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            162 ANNE Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the bracelet does not belong to me. (off his look) It belongs to her. \nAnne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW. D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time. The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance, charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis continues: LOUIS D'Artagnan, I am in your debt. What can I do to repay the courage you've shown me? Anything, D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart desires... D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied, unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him. ATHOS Majesty, his heart has only one desire. To become a Musketeer. D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession. Louis answers with pleasure. LOUIS Then kneel, d'Artagnan. D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of his sword on each of his shoulders. LOUIS The world is an uncertain realm, filled with danger. Truth despoiled by broken promises. Honor undermined by the pursuit of gold. Freedom sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the strong. But there are those who oppose these powerful forces. Those who dedicate their lives to truth, honor, and freedom. They are a constant reminder to all of us. That such a life is not just possible, but necessary to our continued survival. As a country, as a King. These men are known as the Musketeers... (CONTINUED) \n162   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            162 As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony, Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a busy week. \nLOUIS Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them. Musketeer. \nD'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround their young friend, and happily present him with the bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts more valuable than gold. Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise of all who know him... smiles. PORTHOS Do my eyes deceive me? ARAMIS I find it hard to believe myself. \n", "test3_id": 3182}

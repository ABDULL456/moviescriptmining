SANDRA picks up a stool to defend herself. 
INT.  BEDROOM 
Dashing into the bedroom, the children are greeted with a terrifying sight!  SMASH!  Soldier boots are kicking out the little window high in the wall, SMASH, SMASH, SMASH, and the window collapses, a boot sticks through the opening... 
INT.  OTHER ROOM 
Unhurriedly, the giant FIRST SOLDIER bulls through the furniture, tossing the bed and table aside like sticks. 
SANDRA smashes at him with the stool, hitting him twice, hurling it in his face. 
The FIRST SOLDIER shakes off the blow as if he'd been hit by a feather.  But she's got his attention.  He turns his goggles at her, starts to raise his weapon as... 
SANDRA turns and disappears into the bedroom... 
INT.  BEDROOM 
As SANDRA dashes into the bedroom in blind retreat she runs smack into the chest of another soldier! 
Helpless and horrified, she looks right into a cruel stone face and goggled eyes, and she gasps... 
SANDRA Sergeant Todd! 
TODD never takes his eyes off the door as he brushes her roughly aside with one hand, while his other arm aims the heavy rocket gun right at the door and... 
The FIRST SOLDIER comes into the doorway with his flame thrower raised to torch women and children and what he sees is TODD looking right at him, aiming the rocket gun, and BAWHOOM, the FIRST SOLDIER is blown clear back across the other room with a shot right in the chest. 
ANGLE ON SANDRA, still on the floor where he knocked her, watching TODD exit the room, weapon raised, his utility belt dangling bandolier style across his chest. 
He looks like...one of them!  A soldier! 
INT.  OTHER ROOM 
Crossing the next room, TODD moves quickly to the door, flattens, and peers into the corridor. 
He sees the SECOND SOLDIER heading toward him. 
BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires twice around the door and sees... 
The SECOND SOLDIER staggering back, hit, a pistol from his hip... 
Dirt explodes around the door frame as TODD ducks back.  Quick as a wink, he yanks a grenade from his utility belt, triggers it, and flips it around the corner as CRACK!  a shot rips at his arm. 
BAWHOOM, the grenade goes off and, bleeding from his arm, TODD swings into the corridor and follows the grenade with three quick rocket shots. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Keeping low, TODD charges, his weapon pointed at the fallen SECOND SOLDIER. 
The SECOND SOLDIER is sprawled bloodily in the corridor, the walkie-talkie on his chest squawking urgently. WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.) Crawler One calling Double Mike. Give me an "okay," Double Mike. 
TODD seizes the walkie-talkie, presses the transmit button, and snarls a throaty animal growl into the mike... 
INT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE 
CAINE 607 is sitting at the wheel of the motionless vehicle parked near the trench garden, radio mike in hand, when he hears the low ANIMAL SNARL come across his speaker. 
CAINE 607's robot face reveals nothing as he listens to ANOTHER GROWL.  WIND HOWLS outside. 
Then he flicks a switch on the dash and puts the mike to his mouth, his face expressionless. 
CAINE 607 Crawler to Daddy, Crawler to Daddy. Come in, Daddy!

PORTHOLE VIEW/EXT./INT.  OFFICERS' MESS/"DADDY" 
Seen through the thick plexi-porthole, heavily-clothed VETERANS are struggling with a wall, trying to erect the pre-fab unit while the wind, inaudible inside the ship, rages around them, staggering them this way and that.  What we hear in the quiet interior of the mess is CHURCH voicing his disbelief. 
CHURCH (O.S.) A "growl"!  He heard a growl? 
RUBRICK, looking uneasy, is facing CHURCH who's looking up at him from a game of solitaire at the little table.  SLOAN is biting her fingernails in the b.g. 
RUBRICK Well, he didn't say the word "growl."  He said a "throat-noise," but I asked him to imitate it and it sounded like a growl to me. 
CHURCH My God!  Who are we fighting here! 
RUBRICK (nervous) I think...I think we have to assume the missing men are...down. 
CHURCH (getting up, pacing) I knew Mekum's hotshots were green. No reinforcements, then they walk right into an enemy stronghold. 
RUBRICK We could send reinforcements now... 
CHURCH (sharply) Absolutely not.  Those bastards are just waiting in there for us.  No more of this fancy super-soldier shit.  We do it with the hammer... 
RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a nervous glance as CHURCH paces agitatedly. 
RUBRICK Uh, what does that mean, "the hammer"? 
CHURCH (suddenly smug) My daddy always said, "When you want to insert a nail in a piece of wood, you don't do nothing fancy or glamorous, you don't finesse or play the hero, you just pick up your damn hammer and hit that sumbitch till it's in." 
SLOAN (under her breath) Christ!  Now Daddy's a carpenter! 
RUBRICK (to Church) I...don't...quite...follow...sir. 
CHURCH (decisive, sharp) Take the whole unit, both Crawlers, and tell 'em to pound that place with rockets, cannons, mortars, everything we got...from a safe distance. 
RUBRICK (brightening) Raw firepower! 
CHURCH It may not be heroic, and we may waste some ammo, but by God we'll get the job done.

{"train": "Bamboozled \nby \nSpike Lee \nBLACK SCREEN \nWe HEAR the voice of MALCOLM X. \nMALCOLM X (V.O.) You've been hoodwinked.  You've been had.  You've been took. You've been led astray, run amok. You've been bamboozled. \nHis followers ROAR. \nCUT TO TITLE: \n\"BAMBOOZLED\" \nCUT TO CRAWL: \nWHITE LETTERS ON BLACK \nWE HEAR the VOICE of PIERRE DELACROIX. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) Satire.  1a.  A literary work in which human vice or folly is ridiculed or attacked scornfully. B.  The branch of literature that composes such work.  2.  Irony, derision or caustic wit used to attack or expose folly, vice or stupidity. \nINT. APARTMENT - MORNING \nWE are in the living quarters of PIERRE DELACROIX.  The windows overlook the Brooklyn Promenade and the majestic lower Manhattan skyline. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) Bonjour, my name is Pierre Delacroix. I'm a television writer, also a showrunner, a creative person. \nWe see a tall figure move in and around the space. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) I'm one of those people responsible for what you view on your idiot box. \nCLOSE ON \nMonogrammed cuff sleeve - the initials P.D. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) The problem is not enough of you have been watching. \nCLOSE ON \nMonogrammed shirt pocket - the initials P.D. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) With the onslaught of the internet, video and interactive games, nine hundred channels to choose from and whatnot, our valued audience has dramatically eroded. \nCLOSE ON \nRazor cuts a path through a white foam on a black face. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) To put it in much more simple terms... \nDelacroix YELLS. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Like rats fleeing a sinking ship. \nCLOSE ON \nThe handsome face of Pierre Delacroix. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) People tuning out by the millions. \nDelacroix turns to the CAMERA and addresses US. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) Which is not good. \nEXT. TENEMENT - LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING \nThe tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out, but a home, a shelter nonetheless. \nINT. TENEMENT - MORNING \nPeople to our surprise live in here.  It is a commune.  The homeless, people who have been left out, forgot about, written off, and don't matter.  The fringes of society. \nCHEEBA, a skinny Puerto Rican male, tries to wake a slumbering body under a mass of old newspapers. \nCHEEBA Yo, let's get to it.  You don't dance, we don't eat.  Simple as that. \nThe mass begins to move. \nCHEEBA (CONT'D) That's right.  We slow.  We blow. We snooze.  We lose. \nINT. CNS TOWER - MORNING \nMANRAY, a young African-American dread-lock male, and Cheeba are getting set up in front of the entrance to the CONTINENTAL NETWORK SYSTEM building.  CNS is one of the fledgling, upstart new networks, trying to battle with ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, WB, and UPN. \nANGLE ON \nEntrance.  Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the sidewalk.  Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles of the shoes instead of real taps. \nCHEEBA Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I know everybody is in a hurry to work, ready to begin another day in this rat race.  But don't sleep us. I'm Cheeba and I introduce to you the world renown MANRAY, the man with the educated feet. \nManray takes a small bow.  A few, not many, people have stopped to look. \nCHEEBA (CONT'D) As we continue our world wind tour, we would like to give you a little somethin', somethin' before you go off to make that money.  I give you Manray. \nCLOSE ON \nManray, who starts to do his thing, and when he starts doing his thing attention must be paid. \nANGLE ON \nCLOSE ON \nDunwitty. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) I do not like to be the laughing stock of the broadcast industry.  I have pride and people, you better start getting some too.  These numbers have to go up. \nDunwitty turns on the lights.  JOAN, one of the writers, raises her hand. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) Question? \nJOAN So what do you want us to do? \nDUNWITTY What I want everyone to do is write some material that is FUNNY.  The junk you've been writing is about as funny as a dead baby.  It's not funny, it's not new.  It's not sexy. It, it, it... \nCLOSE ON \nFish. \nFISH Sucks. \nANGLE ON \nConference room. \nDUNWITTY SUCKS.  Thank you, Fish.  This meeting is over but I want everyone to seriously think about what I said and how you can deliver. \nPeople scurry out. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now. \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nThe writers, beat down, come out of the conference room and move past SLOAN HOPKINS, a highly attractive African- American \"sistuh.\" \nDelacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk.  He talks under his breath. \nSLOAN How was it? \nDELACROIX Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting? \nSLOAN Nobody told me anything. \nDELACROIX What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this? \nSLOAN It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known. \nINT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING \nDelacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout. \nANGLE ON \nOffice.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking mid-town Manhattan. \nDUNWITTY Do you know what C.P. Time is? \nDELACROIX C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance. \nThey both laugh. \nDUNWITTY Let's sit down over there. \nDunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting. \nDELACROIX I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed. \nDUNWITTY Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me. \nDelacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know \"niggers\" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I. \nDELACROIX I would prefer you not use that word in my presence. \nDUNWITTY NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER. \nDelacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN. \nDELACROIX Say it again.  C'mon, say it again. \nCLOSE ON \nDunwitty.  He's a bloody pulp. \nCLOSE ON \nDelacroix. \nHe straightens his tie. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) Who's a nigger now? \nPOW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO REALITY.  Everything's how we left it. \nDUNWITTY The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again. \nDELACROIX I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom. \nDUNWITTY I'm telling you it's not. \nHe goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window. \nManray screws out the bare light bulb which is the sole source of illumination and lays down onto his mattress on the floor. \nINT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT \nSloan closes her laptop and jumps into her bed. \nINT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT \nDelacroix is already in the bed, the lights are out. \nCLOSE ON \nDelacroix, who's wide awake. \nINT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nManray and Cheeba are both sound asleep. \nCLOSE ON \nCheeba, he has a sheet pulled over his head. \nCLOSE ON \nManray, who's sawing logs, snoring loudly. \nOFF-SCREEN, WE HEAR A RUCKUS, A BIG COMMOTION.  VOICES yelling.  Police sirens, cars and trucks. \nANGLE ON \nApartment.  Cheeba and Manray run to the window and look out. \nTHEIR POV \nThe street is filled with police cars, vans and wagons. Helicopters hover overhead with their searchlights on the building. \nCHEEBA Oh snap!  It's a raid! \nCheeba and Manray jump into their cloths. \nEXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nCops in riot gear storm into the tenement.  A police chief barks over a speaker system. \nPOLICE CHIEF Please evacuate this building.  All of you are illegal residents of this condemned building.  Please leave immediately, by order of the Mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani. \nINT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nStairwell.  It's bedlam.  The hundreds of SQUATTERS who have been living here all making a bad dash trying to flee the NYPD as they \"bumrush the show.\" \nANGLE ON \nFloor.  Cheeba and Manray try to push against the crowd. \nCHEEBA Not this way.  Out through the fire escape. \nThe COPS are running up the staircase.  People try to escape with as many of their belongings that they can hold. \nMANRAY My tap shoes. \nINT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT \nDELACROIX EUREKA!! \nHe jumps out of bed. \nINT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT \nSLOAN Oh my God!!! \nShe too jumps out of bed. \nEXT. TENEMENT BUILDING \nIt is a MADHOUSE, BEDLAM.  It's PANDEMONIUM.  The Squatters are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement. Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their arrests and fill the \"Paddy\" wagons. \nANGLE ON \nStreet.  The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at night, scrambling as the lights turn on.  Do you remember those old \"RAID\" commercials.  \"Let's scram, IT'S RAID!!!\" \nINT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe phone rings. \nCUT TO SPLIT SCREEN \nCU OF DELACROIX AND SLOAN \nDelacroix picks it up.  They yell in unison. \nDELACROIX Manray! \nSLOAN Manray! \nDELACROIX How did you know? \nSLOAN It hit me like a ton of bricks. \nDELACROIX How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary. \nSLOAN The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what? \nINT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nSECURITY GUARD #2 De La Soul ain't here either. Let's go.  Out.  Off the premises. \nManray turns around and sees Sloan. \nMANRAY Sloan!  She knows us. \nThe security guard stops. \nSLOAN It's alright.  They are associates of Mr. Delacroix. \nSECURITY GUARD #1 Sorry, Ms. Hopkins.  They both walked in off the street without an appointment. \nSECURITY GUARD #2 Do you need an escort? \nSLOAN That won't be needed. \nINT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY \nHe sits in front of his TV and watches a tape of the old \"Amos 'n' Andy\" show.  Sloan leads Manray and Cheeba in. \nDELACROIX Eureka!  Where've you been? \nHe hugs them both. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. \nCHEEBA You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short? \nDELACROIX No offense. \nCHEEBA Manray needs a job. \nDelacroix smiles at Sloan. \nMANRAY We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week. \nCHEEBA We was coming to see you. \nMANRAY If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food? \nCHEEBA We're starving. \nDELACROIX I apologize.  What would you like to eat?  Anything you want. \nTIME CUT \nINT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY \nA feast of McDonald's is taking place.  Cheeba and Manray are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries into their mouths.  They were famished. \nDELACROIX I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money. \nCHEEBA How much? \nDELACROIX First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this. \nMANRAY What do I have to do? \nDELACROIX Some tap dancing, some singing. \nMANRAY Where do I sign? \nCHEEBA What kind of show is this gonna be? \nDELACROIX Different. \nMANRAY How different? \nDELACROIX Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other. \nMANRAY DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!! \nDELACROIX That's right.  Money turns the wheel. \nCHEEBA What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time? \nDELACROIX You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me. \nMANRAY Bet. \nDELACROIX I would like to change your name. \nMANRAY To what? \nDELACROIX You're now Mantan. \nMANRAY Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks. \nEXT. BROADWAY - DAY \nManray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks next to Sloan. \nMANRAY I never had a really real pair before. \nSLOAN You've never had any formal training, either? \nMANRAY Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself. \nSLOAN I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while. \nMANRAY You sing and dance? \nSLOAN A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies. \nDelacroix sits with Manray and Cheeba in the living room. \nDELACROIX I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind. \nMANRAY Why? \nDELACROIX You have to start getting into your character. \nCHEEBA At the risk of sounding ignorant... \nCheeba turns quickly towards Manray. \nCHEEBA (CONT'D) ...don't say a word but who is this cat Mantan you keep talkin' 'bout? \nDelacroix hits the remote button.  The TV and VCR are powered. \nCLOSE ON \nTelevision.  We see MANTAN MORELAND in some obscure movie. \nDELACROIX (O.S.) This is Mantan Moreland. \nCLOSER ON \nTelevision.  Mantan reacts to seeing a ghost. \nDELACROIX (O.S.) (CONT'D) He was a clown, a buffoon but he was funny. \nANGLE ON \nLiving room. \nCHEEBA That ain't funny. \nMANRAY DeLa, I don't know 'bout this. \nDELACROIX Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one. \nCHEEBA We might need some mo' money behind this. \nDELACROIX That can be done. \nMANRAY Mantan? \nDELACROIX Mantan!! \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT \nTHE MAU-MAU's in full effect, bob their heads to the funky track that blasts from the studio monitors. \nANGLE ON \nStudio.  They pass around joints that look like they've been on steroids and 64 ounce JUGULARS of DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR - liquid crack, the preferred alcoholic beverage of GHETTO NEGROES.  All the members of the MAU-MAU's are AFRICAN AMERICAN except one.  There is one Caucasian member.  He goes by the name 1/16th BLACK, the engineer tech-whiz kid computer geek. \n1/16TH BLACK Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint. \nBIG BLACK How 'bout... \nBig Black takes a long, long drag on a joint, then he quickly empties a 64 oz. in one swing without missing a beat, without missing a head nod. \nBIG BLACK (CONT'D) Black Iz Black? \nThe whole group goes crazy with the title of the song. \nDOUBLE BLACK That's da bomb. \nMO BLACK That's gonna give me some inspiration. \nJO BLACK Gonna make me get my flow on. \nBIG BLACK We should call dis da BLACK album. \nEveryone starts high-fiving each other. \nSMOOTH BLACK Yo, check it out.  We have never conformed to none of the white man's rules and regulations and later for that ole slave owner Webster.  Therefore I respectfully submit BIG BLACK that we from now on, hence forth and whatnot spell BLACK: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K. \nHARD BLACK I feel dat. \n1/16TH BLACK B-L-A-K.  BLAK.  The darkest of all colors, the opposite of white.  A member of an African people.  But check it out, here's where the grey people try to get slick with their trickery.  Listen to the full connotations.  GLOOMY.  DEPRESSING. EVIL.  WICKED.  ANGRY.  SULLEN. (MORE) \n1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D) BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more. \nBIG BLACK B-L-A-K it is. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nA middle-aged African-American woman is working in the kitchen.  Delacroix sits at the kitchen table talking with her.  This is his MOM, ORCHID DOTHAN. \nOrchid puts a plate of food in front of her son. \nORCHID You must think I'm some kind of fool. \nDELACROIX It looks delicious. \nORCHID You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong. \nDELACROIX C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff. \nORCHID I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong. \nShe sits down with him. \nORCHID (CONT'D) How's the food? \nEveryone raises their glasses.  CLINK! \nSLOAN Excuse me. \nSloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix. \nANGLE ON \nSteps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Wait here. \nShe goes to the ladies' cubicle. \nCLOSE ON \nDelacroix.  He leans against the wall. \nANGLE ON \nBathroom door.  Sloan comes out, grabs him inside. \nINT. LADIES' ROOM - NIGHT \nSloan locks the door. \nSLOAN What is your problem? \nDELACROIX My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW. \nSLOAN Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made? \nDELACROIX It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money. \nSLOAN Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do? \nSomeone begins to pound on the bathroom door. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Will you please let me in?  I have to use the toilet. \nSLOAN You're gonna have to hold it in because we're not finished yet... \nShe returns her attention to Delacroix. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) ...QUIT then. \nDELACROIX Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. \nSLOAN What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up? \nDELACROIX I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. \nSLOAN Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it. \nThe banging starts again. \nMANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.) Please open this bathroom door immediately.  You are being very inconsiderate. \nSloan unlocks the door and they exit. \nANGLE ON \nLadies' bathroom.  Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the bathroom as they rush in. \nINT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING \nDELACROIX I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing \"Amos and Andy.\"  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain. \nDUNWITTY To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job. \nDELACROIX I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after. \nDUNWITTY I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video. \nDELACROIX You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot? \nDUNWITTY I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind. \nDELACROIX Besides, what does he know about Negroes? \nDUNWITTY Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless. \nDELACROIX What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video? \nDUNWITTY If Spielburg can direct \"The Color Purple\" and \"Amistad\", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot. \nDELACROIX That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything? \nDUNWITTY No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that. \nDELACROIX In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!! \nDUNWITTY Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much. \nDelacroix stares at Dunwitty. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY \nDelacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers. \nCLOSE ON \nDelacroix \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Were people this desperate to get work? \nCLOSE ON \nDelacroix.  He interrupts Lulu. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) Thanks, Ms. Lulu. \nLULU But I had several more poems. \nDELACROIX That's good.  We've seen enough. We'll get back to you. \nLulu scurries off stage. \nRUTH (O.S.) Next. \nThe Mau-Mau's run onto the stage, yelling and screaming. \nThey are all fired up, in fact several fire their 9mm's into the ceiling. \nANGLE - TWO SHOT \nDelacroix and Sloan. \nSLOAN This is the group I was telling you about. \nDELACROIX Which one is your brother? \nSLOAN The big one. \nCLOSE ON \nRuth. \nRUTH Let's get started here. \nANGLE ON \nSTAGE \nBig Black preens around on the stage. \nBIG BLACK The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's. \nDELACROIX (O.S.) What's your name? \nBIG BLACK My righteous name is BIG BLACK. \nDELACROIX (O.S.) And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today? \nBIG BLACK We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science. \nCLOSE ON \nSloan, who's trying to disappear.  If she sits any lower she'll be under her seat. \nON DELACROIX \nDELACROIX We're ready when you are. \nON STAGE \nBIG BLACK Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself. \nDOUBLE BLACK Yo, I'm Double Black. \nBLACK BLACK Check it, Black Black. \nSMOOTH BLACK I'm Smooth Black, the lover in dis' piece. \nHARD BLACK Hard Black. \nMO BLACK He's Jo Black. \nJO BLACK And he's Mo Black. \n1/16TH BLACK I'm last but not least, you can call me 1/16th Black. \nON DELACROIX \nDELACROIX Good.  We're really blacked-oops, backed up, so shall we begin? \nON STAGE \nBIG BLACK Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  Yo, the name of this joint is BLAK IZ BLAK.  Hit it. \nThe booming track starts and the Mau-Mau's do their thing, bouncing all over the stage.  The lyrics about everything that is BLAK!!! \nON DELACROIX \nA look of disbelief is on his face. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) Needless to say, the Mau-Mau's did not fit into our plans. \nON SLOAN \nShe's in shock, horrified. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) As I told Sloan, there's a black sheep in every family. \nBACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY \nDelacroix is screaming at the top of his lungs. \nON LIPS \nSLOAN (V.O.) ...are the lips. \nMantan is applying lipstick. \nINT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM \nON LIPS \nSleep 'N Eat is puckering his lips as he too puts on the lipstick. \nSLOAN (V.O.) The redder the lipstick the better. I suggest firetruck red. \nON MIRROR \nFor the first time WE SEE SLEEP 'N EAT in FULL BLACK FACE. \nSLEEP 'N EAT Show... \nINT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM \nON MIRROR \nMantan in FULL BLACK FACE. \nMANTAN ...TIME!!! \nINT. STAGE - NIGHT \nThe audience is in an uproar when the lights go down.  They applaud and they quiet as the CURTAIN GOES UP on a bucolic setting.  It is a combination of WATERMELON PATCH and COTTON FIELD. \nON STAGE \nFirst Sleep 'N Eat then Mantan shuffles onto the stage. \nMANTAN This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat. \nSLEEP 'N EAT And this is my very best friend Mantan. \nBOTH We're two real COONS! \nThe audience lets out nervous laughter.  They don't know what to think. \nMANTAN We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...the big apple, New York, New York. \nMANTAN To come back to our roots. \nSLEEP 'N EAT Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's. \nMANTAN No mo' \"city slickers.\"  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton? \nSLEEP 'N EAT Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan. \nMANTAN Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat. \nSLEEP 'N EAT Give or cousins some of dem educated feets. \nMantan begins to do a slow, steady step. \nSLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D) Cousins, first, second, third and distant, let's have Mantan take us all the way back to a much more simpler time.  A time wen men were men, women were women, and Neggras knew their place. \nThe AUDIENCE is aghast.  Mantan has picked up the pace. He's tapping fast and furious. \nMANTAN Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat. \nSLEEP 'N EAT You tellin' the truth. \nMANTAN Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE! \nMantan stops dancing and collapses. \nON AUDIENCE \nThey're stunned.  They can't believe what they've heard, what they've seen.  What they've been witness to. \nON YOUNG WHITE COUPLE \nThey look at the black people in the audience. \nON YOUNG HIP-HOP BLACK MALE \nHe starts to clap slowly. \nON AUDIENCE \nSlowly more black people begin to applaud.  Slowly it sweeps up into the black people. \nThe WHITE AUDIENCE, of course, has been waiting to see how their black brothers and sisters would react.  Now feeling comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause. \nON AUDIENCE \nThe applause changes into laughter.  It is not nervous laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER. \nON BLACK AND WHITE FACES \nThe laughter is contagious. \nON STAGE \nMantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead.  He slowly gets up from his prostate position as he HEARS: \nDELACROIX C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. \nORCHID Peerless, last time, go see your father. \nEXT. PARK - NIGHT \nMantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is being said.  He sits up and starts to do a dance for her. To her. \nON BENCH \nMantan is doing that \"Mating\" tap dance. \nSLOAN Are you trying to seduce me? \nHe puts his index finger over his mouth - \"Quiet.\" \nSLOAN (CONT'D) You think that's gonna work, huh? \nHe quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position. \nON MANTAN AND SLOAN \nThey kiss. \nEXT. I-95 SOUTH - MORNING \nDelacroix is driving \"down south.\" \nINT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nDelacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself.  HE SPEAKS TO US through the MIRROR \nDELACROIX I figured this was a good time to get away.  Just jump in my ride and go.  I always did my best thinking when I was driving alone.  I needed to think out clearly what I was going to do with this MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. \nEXT. I-95 SOUTH \nDelacroix is driving on his way to \"Ole Virginny.\" \nEXT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK - NIGHT \nDelacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink, funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint. \nCLOSE ON NEON SIGN \n\"MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK\" - most the letters do not light up, underneath it, \"2-NITE - JUNEBUG.\" \nINT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK \nIt's loud as hell as Delacroix enters this smoky, dark establishment. \nP.O.V. DELACROIX \nThis must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM, the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from \"Luke\" video. \nON SUGAR SHAK \nDelacroix works himself through the crowded BAR/DISCO into another small room. \nON COMEDY ROOM \nHe walks into a small space where his father JUNEBUG is on the stage. \nON JUNEBUG \nHe is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and sips it often. \nON COMEDY ROOM \nDelacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him. \nON DELACROIX \nHe looks around. \nP.O.V. DELACROIX \nIt's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty. \nON TABLE \nA couple gets loud, arguing over something. \nON JUNEBUG \nJUNEBUG 'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please show me some respect.  I'm up here trying to make a living. \nMAN Mind yo' business. \nJUNEBUG Don't make me have to come over there and whoop you upside ya head. \nThe sparse AUDIENCE laughs. \nJUNEBUG (CONT'D) Just messin' with ya.  But please if you and your lady need to discuss something, take it outside. Thank you. \nHe continues on with his show. \nON TABLE \nDelacroix walks over to the fighting couple. \nDELACROIX Brother man, that's my father up there and I drove a long way to see him perform.  Please take this fifty, go buy you and the young lady some drinks in the club. \nThe guy looks him up and down. \nMANTAN ...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...aconite get it dat cheap. \nMANTAN I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner. \nSLEEP 'N EAT We should go out on a double date. \nMANTAN I heard ya lady is wild. \nSLEEP 'N EAT No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. \nMANTAN Oh, because on our first date, she let me... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...no, she didn't... \nMANTAN ...yes she did. \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...I heard different, thought that was... \nMANTAN ...not that time... \nSLEEP 'N EAT So when are you comin' to pick us up? \nMANTAN Around... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...too early... \nMANTAN ...then what about... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...too late, maybe around... \nMANTAN ...perfect... \nSLEEP 'N EAT That's what I like about you and me. We git along... \nMANTAN ...like macaroni and cheese... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...like grits and butter... \nMANTAN ...like fried and chicken... \nSLEEP 'N EAT ...like sleep and eat. \nOFF-SCREEN we HEAR the VOICE of MASSA CHARLIE, he's the overseer of this plantation. \nMASSA CHARLIE (O.S.) Who goes in there? \nSLEEP 'N EAT We'd better hide. \nMANTAN It's dat mean, evil overseer Massa Charlie. \nThey hide behind some boxes. \nMASSA CHARLIE I say who goes in there? \nBOTH There's nobody in here 'cept us chickens. \nMassa Charlie enters the chicken coops with a SHOTGUN blazing.  Sleep 'N Eat and Mantan do a jig as they try to escape the buckshot. \nON AUDIENCE \nThey're rolling down the aisles in hysterics. \nINT. CONTROL BOOTH \nEveryone in the booth is laughing uncontrollably.  Except Delacroix.  Even Sloan is dying. \nDELACROIX Who's side are you on? \nSLOAN I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny. \nDelacroix starts to crack a smile.  He is definitely trying to hold it in. \nINT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe sits in front of the television, which is off. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) It was the Day of Reckoning.  After a massive advertising and publicity campaign... \nCLOSER \nDelacroix stares at the blank screen. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the public would finally get a chance to view Mantan.  I was feelin' a little bit like Dr. Frankenstein. \nINT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSloan, Jessica, Mantan and Cheeba are gathered around the television in the small studio apartment, jabbering away. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest. \nSLOAN Everybody shut up. \nON TV SCREEN \nWe see the OPENING of MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.  It is in CLAYMATION.  Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat are doing a \"jig.\"  Their noses and lips are done in a grotesque characterization, BIG WIDE BEGROIDAL NOSES and JUICY RED SAUCER SOUP COOLING LIPS. \nHONEYCUTT (V.O.) Calling all my cousins, you're about to take a trip down to Hang 'Em High Plantation, home of your two favorite coons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat. \nON SLOAN, JESSICA, MANTAN, AND CHEEBA \nMantan isn't happy. \nDUNWITTY I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz. \nMYRNA First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King. \nDELACROIX Why are you here? \nMYRNA Good question, straight to the point.  I like your style.  Because of the content of the show we can expect some spirited reactions. \nDUNWITTY Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy. \nMYRNA The best defense is offense. \nDELACROIX I thought it was the other way around. \nMYRNA You get my point.  I've mapped out some strategies to help bolster our position. \nSLOAN Which is? \nMYRNA That this is fun.  Nice wholesome fun. \nDUNWITTY Goldfarb, run it down for them. \nMYRNA The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, \"F\" 'em. \nDUNWITTY We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing. \nSLOAN It sounds kinda simplistic to me. \nMYRNA I've done my research. \nDELACROIX These are black folks we're talkin' about, not some lab mice in a cage. \nMYRNA Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in African-American studies from Yale, so I do feel I'm qualified. \nDUNWITTY Let Myrna finish. \nMYRNA Thank you.  And always smile. \nDELACROIX Yeah, show dem pearly whites. \nShe ignores him. \nMYRNA Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the word \"community\" often when talking about Mantan.  And finally our biggest plus is you, Pierre Delacroix. \nDELACROIX Me? \nDUNWITTY Yes you! \nMYRNA This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black. \nDELACROIX I'm not black.  I'm a NEGRO!!! \nINT. CNS HALLWAY - POST MEETING \nSloan and Delacroix are walking in the hallway.  They keep getting interrupted by people who congratulate Delacroix on the success of the show. \nSLOAN So you have your small victory, now what? \nDELACROIX A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing. \nINT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - MORNING \nSloan hands Delacroix a wrapped gift. \nDELACROIX What is this? \nSLOAN A gift. \nDELACROIX For what? \nSLOAN No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it. \nDelacroix opens his gift.  It is one of those old cast iron Black Collectibles.  This one is called \"THE JOLLY NIGGER BANK,\" a head of a Negro, big lips, big nose, wide eyes. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Put a coin in the hand. \nHe puts a quarter in the hand. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Watch this. \nShe pushes the lever and the mouth opens, the quarter flies in and his eyes go to the top of his head. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Read it on the back. \nDelacroix reads. \nDELACROIX The Jolly Nigger Bank. \nSLOAN This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century. \nDELACROIX Thanks. \nSLOAN I thought it was appropiate. \nDELACROIX Is that good or bad? \nSLOAN It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles. \nDELACROIX How so? \nSLOAN To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human. \nCLOSE ON JOLLY NIGGER BANK \nMantan and Cheeba sit at a big table with Puff Daddy, Andre Harrell, Russell Simmons and other assorted RAPPERS. Everyone is drinking that DOM P.  Buxom Hotties sit in between the BIG WILLIES. \nEXT. CNS BUILDING - DAY \nA group of protesters led by the REVEREND JESSE JACKSON and AL SHARPTON carry signs and banners objecting to Mantan. They're calling upon the FCC to pull the show off the air and for the boycotting of the show's two sponsors: TIMMI HILLNIGGER and DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR. \nON PROTESTERS \nThe press is watching. \nINT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY \nDelacroix has now decorated his entire office with Black Collectibles Art.  WE SEE black jockey lawn pieces, banks, mammies, signs for products, etc. \nON WINDOW \nDelacroix and Mantan are looking out the office window down on the protesters. \nMANTAN Why is Jess and Reverend Al down there? \nDELACROIX So they can be on TV. \nMANTAN You sound like the media. \nDELACROIX This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow. \nMANTAN Same thing Giuliani said. \nDELACROIX Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity. \nHe hands Mantan a wrapped gift. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) Rest your mind.  It's a little somethin' something. \nMantan opens it.  He pulls out an old pair of tap shoes. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) Those were the last pair of tap shoes worn by Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson.  In fact, he died with them on. \nMantan starts to laugh. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) No joke.  Serious. \nMANTAN Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill. \nDELACROIX In time. \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT \nThe Mau-Mau's are in meeting.  They all drink 64 ounce jugulars of Da Bomb, are all attired from head to toe in TIMMI HILLNIGGER Active Ghetto Wear and brandish their 9's. \nBIG BLACK That Tom, That Negro... \nDOUBLE BLACK ...that handkerchief head... \nBLACK BLACK ...dancing monkey... \n1/16TH BLACK ...Benedict Arnold... \nBIG BLACK ...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'? \nHARD BLACK Yo, Big Black, Sleep 'N Eat ain't even a nigger, y'knowwhatI'msayin'? \nSMOOTH BLACK He's Mexican, y'knowwhatI'msayin'? \nMO BLACK He's Dominican, y'knowwhatI'msayin'? \nJO BLACK He's Peter Rican, y'knowwhatI'msayin'? \nBIG BLACK Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'! \n1/16TH BLACK We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill. \nBIG BLACK 1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat. \nDOUBLE BLACK Let me gat him. \nBIG BLACK Nah, too easy, this has to be symbolic, has to be on the world stage. \nINT. MANTAN'S APARTMENT - CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY \nMantan is showing Sloan his new residence. \nSLOAN This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny. \nMANTAN Sloan, I got it like 'dat. \nSLOAN Oh you do, huh? \nMANTAN Just a little something' somethin'. \nSLOAN I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'. \nMANTAN Gots no intention of ending up broke. \nSLOAN Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist. \nMANTAN No, before my time. \nSLOAN You don't read, do you? \nMANTAN Never read a book in my whole life. \nSLOAN Maybe you need to start. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) To my astonishment, not only did the people in TV land love us, but also the critics. \nCLOSE ON DELACROIX \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Mantan was being hailed as groundbreaking, barrier breaking, also earth shaking.  I looked forward to my awards.  Just vindication for all my hard work, all my talent that had been previously overlooked. \nINT. THEATER - NIGHT \nDelacroix sits in tux amongst many stars. \nALEC BALDWIN The winner for Best New Sitcom is... The envelope please... \nA starlet hands him the envelope. \nALEC BALDWIN (CONT'D) The winner is... Pierre Delacroix for Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show! \nDelacroix jumps out og his chair and starts sobbing.  Two ushers have to help him to the stage.  He is overcome with emotion.  The audience is on their feet with a standing ovation.  He hugs Alec Baldwin. \nDELACROIX Alec Baldwin, this is the very first time we've ever met, you don't know this, I'm your biggest fan and I want you to have my Emmy. It's for you, out of the deep bowels of my heart - I don't deserve this.  You take it. \nAlec Baldwin is shocked.  He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug and they both cry like babies. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) If I did that I'd be assured to work forever.  Delacroix the grateful Negro. \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT \nDelacroix sits at a table in his lucky tux. \nWOODY HARRELSON The winner for Best Sit-Com is... \nWoody opens the envelope. \nWOODY HARRELSON (CONT'D) ...Pierre Delacroix for Mantan. Come on up and get your Golden Globe. \nDelacroix jumps out of his seat and sprints.  He gets down on the stage and starts to breakdance, even spinning on his head. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) That routine would go over like gangbusters.  I would be a dancing fool, Hollywood's new favorite Negro, move over Danny, Morgan, Samuel L., move over Whoopi. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nDelacroix is finishing up the meeting. \nDELACROIX I had it all planned.  To the T. \nINT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY \nMantan is running rigorous rehearsal of The Pikaninnies. Over and over, repetition after repetition, Snowflake, Rastus, Sambo, Nigger Jim, Jungle Bunny and Aunt Jemima try to do an intricate dance step. \nMANTAN I'm tired of you pickaninnies messing up my choreography.  It goes like this. \nMantan does the step with ease. \nMANTAN (CONT'D) Try it again. \nThe dancers do it once more. \nMANTAN (CONT'D) Better. \nCheeba walks in.  Mantan checks him out. \nMANTAN (CONT'D) Let's take a ten minute break. \nThey quickly file past Cheeba without saying a word.  The rehearsal space is just the two. \nCHEEBA I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. \nMANTAN What are you talkin' about? \nCHEEBA Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. \nMANTAN Meaning? \nCHEEBA I'm out. \nMANTAN Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway. \nCHEEBA So that's what you been doing? \nMANTAN Damn skippy. \nCHEEBA You're in this up till ya neck. \nMANTAN Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players. \nCHEEBA You can walk away.  We both can. \nMANTAN Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent. \nCHEEBA I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit. \nCheeba walks out. \nMANTAN I'm the star of Mantan, so you do that.  Quit, walk away.  And don't come crawling back, either. \nINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nMantan and Sloan ride in back.  He's still thinking about Cheeba. \nSLOAN Why don't you call him? \nMANTAN For what?  He left.  Not me. \nEXT. APOLLO THEATRE - NIGHT \nNow projectiles are raining down upon Mantan.  This has turned into a RUCKUS, a BROUHAHA, a DONNYBROOK.  Honeycutt races onto the stage to pull off the still tap dancing Mantan as the Harlem natives BUMRUSH the stage.  THE WORM HAS TURNED. \nON MAU-MAU'S BOX \nMantan, led by Honeycutt, runs for his life. \nON MOB \nThey chase him. \nON BACKSTAGE DOOR \nMantan is hauling ass. \nEXT. BACKSTAGE \nThe door crashes open, Mantan rockets out into an open car door. \nON CAR DOOR \nThe door slams. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nThe car spins away. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nDelacroix is behind the wheel.  This is the most shaken we've seen Mantan to date. \nDELACROIX Pull ya self together. \nMantan is distraught. \nDELACROIX (CONT'D) What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me? \nMANTAN No. \nDELACROIX You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing? \nMANTAN Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece. \nDELACROIX You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? \nMANTAN Yeah. \nDELACROIX And now is definitely not the time to bitch up. \nEXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT \nDelacroix speeds away. \nINT. BET STUDIO - NIGHT \nMantan is on the BET show with host TAVIS SMILEY. \nTAVIS SMILEY Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in. \nMANTAN Tavis, thank you for having me. \nTAVIS SMILEY Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here. \nMANTAN I'm more comfortable around my people. \nTAVIS SMILEY Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this? \nMANTAN Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, \"it's all about the Benjamins.\" \nTAVIS SMILEY Money and nothing else? \nMANTAN Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game. \nTAVIS SMILEY Is it inevitable that the game plays you? \nMANTAN No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better. \nTAVIS SMILEY Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort? \nMANTAN I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time. \nTAVIS SMILEY I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. (MORE) \nTAVIS SMILEY (CONT'D) Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head. \nON MANTAN \nBIG BLACK (O.S.) Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout. \nMANTAN That's our opinion. \nBIG BLACK (O.S.) You're a traitor to the race.  A tool for the Caucasoids. \nMANTAN Why?  Because I'm successful? Because I don't use \"Causcasoids\" as an excuse for not fulfilling my dreams? \nBIG BLACK (O.S.) I ain't hearing all dat noise.  You getting played and you don't even know it. \nTAVIS SMILEY And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do? \nBIG BLACK (O.S.) What do I do? \nTAVIS SMILEY What do you do? \nBIG BLACK (O.S.) I'm a revolutionary. \nSLOAN After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant. \nMANTAN And? \nSLOAN And what? \nMANTAN Stop playing me Sloan. \nSLOAN Just ask me what you want to know. \nMANTAN Oh, you gonna make me say it. \nSLOAN Say what, Manray? \nMANTAN Did you ever sleep with DeLa? \nSLOAN We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned. \nMANTAN Aw, c'mon. \nSLOAN That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I. \nMANTAN So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like \"IHOP.\"  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass. \nSLOAN Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa? \nMANTAN Don't try to change to the subject. \nSLOAN Why don't you answer? \nMANTAN I know I won't be your puppet. \nSLOAN You can go now. \nMANTAN I wuz leaving anyway, for good. \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT \nAs usual, the clan is smoking and drinking DA BOMB, a thick marijuana haze hangs over the studio. \n1/16TH BLACK Yo, I got da bomb plan.  We gonna hook homeslice Mantan up nicely. \nHe holds up a floppy disk. \nINT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nDelacroix sits behind the desk.  He's bought even more Black Collectibles, he's surrounded by them. \nON DELACROIX \nHe dials the phone. \nDELACROIX Hello, Mommy, how are you? \nORCHID (O.S.) I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery. \nDELACROIX You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me? \nINT. ORCHID'S HOUSE \nORCHID Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success. \nDELACROIX (O.S.) Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called? \nORCHID No. \nON DELACROIX \nDELACROIX Not at all? \nORCHID (O.S.) You know how your Daddy is. \nDELACROIX If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan. \nORCHID (O.S.) I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother? \nDELACROIX Soon. \nDelacroix hangs up the phone.  He takes out some change from his pocket and puts a quarter in the hand of his Jolly Nigger Bank. \nTIGHT ON JNB \nDelacroix flips the lever and the quarter flies into the MOUTH as the EYES roll to the top of its HEAD. \nDelacroix does this several times.  CLOSEUPS of the BLACK COLLECTIBLES in the office. \nCLOSER ON JNB \nDelacroix is staring at the JNB when its MOUTH OPENS, a quarter flies in and its EYES roll to the top of its HEAD. \nON DELACROIX \nHe is incredulous. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I thought or imagined that my favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an inanimate object, a piece of cold, cast iron, was moving by itself... \nDelacroix slowly, carefully approaches the bank and picks it off the table. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...I knew I was getting paranoid. Did I really see what I saw or was I buggin'? \nON JNB \nIt's stopped moving. \nON AUDIENCE \nThe THUNDEROUS ROAR is CUT OFF LIKE the LIGHTS, LIKE CON EDISON PULLS THE PLUG WHEN YOU DON'T PAY THE BILL. \nINT.

Manray gets up and begins to dance. \nON STAGE \nDunwitty runs to Bunning. \nDUNWITTY Drop the curtain.  Drop the curtain. \nBunning drops the curtain.  Security rushes onto the stage and grabs Manray. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) Escort him out the building now! \nMANRAY I wasn't finished doing my dance. \nDUNWITTY But you are finished.  Done. Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen. I'm gonna slide Honeycutt right into ya spot.  We won't miss a step. Get him outta here. \nThe security guards move Manray as Dunitty glares at Delacroix.  Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to the top. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) DeLa, I'll deal with you next. \nEXT. BACKSTAGE \nThe security guards toss Manray out the stage door.  Manray looks down the alley and it's empty except for a parked SUV. He picks himself up and does a joyous dance.  This is Manray's dance of Freedom. \nON STREET \nThe Big Black Chevy Suburban creeps down the alley to a dancing Manray and comes to rest right in front of him. Manray tries to shield his eyes from the hi-beam headlights. \nMANRAY Whaddup? \nNo one comes out. \nMANRAY (CONT'D) Whaddup? \nThe doors open and the Mau-Mau's file out. \nBIG BLACK You truly are a dancing fool. \n1/16TH BLACK Yo Black, you looking for trouble. \nMANRAY Don't start none, won't be none. \nThe Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.

He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle. \nEXT. EMPTY BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT \nThe Mau-Mau Mobile rolls up to an abandoned factory. \nON CHEVY SUBURBAN \nThe Mau-Mau's quickly carry Manray out from the back of the vehicle into the factory. \nINT.

A digital video camera stands on a tripod in front of him. \nBIG BLACK You is one dead nigger. \nMANRAY What did I do? \nBIG BLACK What did you do? \nThe Mau-Mau's laugh. \nBIG BLACK (CONT'D) Brothers, he asks what did he do? \nDOUBLE BLACK If you don't know there is nuthin' we can do for you. \nBIG BLACK Nigga, you will be executed. \nON MANRAY \nHis face says he can't believe this is happening. \nMANRAY For singing and dancing? \n1/16TH BLACK You will be done in front of the world. \nMONTAGE \nPolice squads, SWAT Teams are busting into the wrong homes, apartments, projects, hi-tech computer labs looking for the Mau-Mau's. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) SWAT teams all up and down the East Coast busted in on known dissidents looking for Manray.  All the tips called in, info gathered through surveillance proved for naught. \nINT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM \nBARNETT The both of you should go home.  We will keep you abreast. \nSLOAN This is looking like a needle in a haystack.  It's hopeless. \nDelacroix holds Sloan as he leads her out.  She is having difficulty breathing with her asthma. \nDELACROIX Thank you for your help. \nBARNETT The X-Force always gets their man. \nINT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe sits in front of his GIANT SCREEN, on the desk in front of him is the 3/4 inch cassette Sloan gave him.  He picks it up and turns it on. \nDELACROIX (V.O.) It was ten o'clock and the Dance of Death was about to commence. \nON MONITOR \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Since a lot of people still didn't have computers, the networks sought a court order to carry it live, taking the feed off the internet. It was granted.  A life snuff broadcast right into your living room. \nON DELACROIX \nDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) I had to give it to the Mau-Mau', they definitely had a sense of irony.  They chose www.nigger.com as the website to pirate. \nINT. FACTORY - NIGHT \nThe Mau-Mau's ironically wear WHITE MASKS, they stand behind the tied-up Mantan.  A device alters their voices. \nBIG BLACK We are LIVE on the cyberspace. Whereas Mantan is a TOM... \nBLACK BLACK Whereas Mantan is a disgrace... \nSMOOTH BLACK Whereas Mantan is a head-scratching, foot-shuffling Negro... \n1/16TH BLACK Whereas, whereas, where's the ass? \nThe Mau-Mau's laugh. \nBIG BLACK Whereas Mantan the dancing fool, you are condemned to death. \nJO BLACK The Dance of Death. \n1/16th Black unties Manray. \nMONTAGE \nWE SEE DELACROIX, SLOAN, CHEEBA WITH LOURDESE, DUNWITTY, JUNEBUG AND DOT, ORCHID, THE X-FORCE WATCHING THIS SPECTACLE ON COMPUTERS OR TV SCREENS. \nON COMPUTER SCREEN \nWe see a CARTOON, Yosemite Sam is shooting at the feet of Bugs Bunny with his six-shooter in each hand.  Bugs Bunny is doing a fast dance, dodging bullets. \nON MONITOR \nThe Mau-Mau's shoot at the feet of Manray. \nBIG BLACK Dance nigger. \nManray taps. \nSMOOTH BLACK You got anything to say for yourself? \nMANRAY If you're gonna kill me, kill me. \nSMOOTH BLACK Don't worry. \nINT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nShe is having an asthma attack, it was brought on by the proceedings.  Sloan uses her inhaler. \nINT. FACTORY - NIGHT \nEach Mau-Mau has a 9mm and is firing it at the feet of Manray.  They scream \"Faster!\" and \"Dance!\" Manray is hoofing.  He's never tapped this fast, at this breakneck pace, ever.  But it's evident his dance is one of defiance. He's not dancing to stay alive. \nINT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nHe screams at the monitor. \nDELACROIX Don't dance.  Don't do it. \nINT. FACTORY \nThe Mau-Mau's have noticed Manray's strong will, his pride and they don't like it.  They shoot even more at his feet. \nBIG BLACK You ain't Blak. \nDOUBLE BLACK Blak you ain't. \nSMOOTH BLACK You a Oreo.  Not Blak.  Not BLAK. \nThe Mau-Mau's start to chant, \"Blak, blak, blak.\" \nINT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT \nShe hears this and quickly picks up the phone to call the authorities. \n", "test1_input": "INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING \nOne by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the sofa. \nDUNWITTY Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right. \nDELACROIX It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan. \nSLOAN Hello. \nDELACROIX This is Cheeba. \nCHEEBA Nice to meet you. \nDELACROIX And this is Manray. \nMANRAY How do you do? \nDUNWITTY Good.  I like the names.  Very theatrical. \nDELACROIX We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. \nDUNWITTY I'm wid it. \nDELACROIX I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. \nDUNWITTY Go on.  Good so far. \nDELACROIX I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw? \nDUNWITTY Word!!! \nDELACROIX So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium. \nDUNWITTY The name of the show? \nDELACROIX It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. \nDUNWITTY I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister. \nDunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) I'm feelin' dis'! \nDELACROIX It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. \nDUNWITTY Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance? \nDELACROIX I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go. \nDUNWITTY Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again? \nMANTAN That's me. \nDELACROIX And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat. \nCLOSE ON \nCheeba.  A look of surprise is on his face.  Complete, utter surprise. \nDUNWITTY That's a great handle. \nDELACROIX Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire. \nDUNWITTY I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back. \nSloan looks at Delacroix with concern. \nDELACROIX Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo. \nDUNWITTY What are there character traits? \nDELACROIX Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky. \nDUNWITTY Exactly! \nDELACROIX Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire. \nDUNWITTY And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick? \nDELACROIX Yep, you guessed it. \nDUNWITTY This could be bigger than \"Amos and Andy.\" \nDELACROIX Protest finally forced \"Amos and Andy\" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on. \nDUNWITTY Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen. \nDelacroix looks at Sloan. \nDELACROIX Negroes would be in an uproar. \nDUNWITTY So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing. \nDELACROIX Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet. \nDUNWITTY Who are the other characters? \nDELACROIX Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima. \nDunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one. \nDUNWITTY We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting? \n", "test1_true": "DUNWITTY Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. (MORE) \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive. \nDELACROIX I don't know about that plantation angle. \nDUNWITTY What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this? \nSLOAN We'd get a lot of mail. \nShe laughs, it's a fake one at that. \nSLOAN (CONT'D) Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn't be another show like it. \nCHEEBA I've always wanted to be on television. \nDUNWITTY I like you.  Sleep 'n Eat.  That's funny.  Mantan, how do you feel about performing in black face? \nMANTAN As long as the hoofing is real, that I can do my thing, I can blacken up.  Let me hit it, beats and rhythms, express myself. \nDUNWITTY Show me a little somethin' somethin'. \nMantan starts to put on his new tap shoes. \nDUNWITTY (CONT'D) Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper than deep. \nMantan is ready. \nMANTAN I'm gonna give you just a taste. My tap shoes are brand new.  I haven't trained 'em yet. \nHe starts to work out. \nMANTAN (CONT'D) Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms.  Beats, beats, beats.  No Fred Astaire here, baby.  Just rawness. \nDunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff flying onto the floor.  And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up on his desk and really starts hitting it. \nCLOSE ON \nDelacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face. \nCLOSE ON \nMantan, he's bringing it home.  With the final move, he leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and FREEZES. \nANGLE ON \nThe office. \nDUNWITTY That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook! \nDELACROIX We think so. \nDUNWITTY Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do? \nCHEEBA I play the straight man.  I do some singing and dancing also.  I also manage Mantan. \nDUNWITTY Oh you do so? \nCHEEBA I'm the man behind the man behind the man. \nDUNWITTY You da man. \nCHEEBA No, you da man. \nDUNWITTY I'm gonna run upstairs with this. If CNS doesn't want to do this, somebody else will have da balls to pull the trigger.  I want to thank each and every one of you.  This is great, Delacroix.  I'll get back to you later today. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCheeba and Mantan are walking in midtown Manhattan.  They both have a pep in their step, money in their pockets, and a roof over their heads. \nCHEEBA Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood. \nMANTAN You might be right. \nCHEEBA Why are you smiling so? \nHis smile is a mile wide. \nMANTAN I'm not smiling. \nCHEEBA Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins. \nMANTAN It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face. \nCHEEBA No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open.

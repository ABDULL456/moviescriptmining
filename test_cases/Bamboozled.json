Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons? \nDELACROIX To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons? \nORCHID Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon.

Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you. \nMANTAN The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way. \nDelacroix gets up from the table and leaves. \nCHEEBA What's wrong with him? \nMANTAN Must be the pressure. \nCheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap.

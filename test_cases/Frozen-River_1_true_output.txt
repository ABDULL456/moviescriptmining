After a moment, she gets out with the gun and walks up to the camper. 
The bullet hole in the door has a sock stuffed in it. 
RAY (low tone) I want my part. 
40   INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    40 
Lila is asleep next to a rattling propane heater. 
RAY (O.S.) (knocks with the gun) You hear me! 
Lila's eyes pop open but she stays perfectly still. Ray shakes the door handle. 
RAY (CONT'D) I want my part. 
Lila sits up on her cot and puts on her jacket. 
RAY (CONT'D) I want my part. 
LILA I'll give you the money if you give me the car. 
RAY No way. 
LILA The money's gone. 
RAY Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese. 
The door opens. Ray steps back holding the gun. They look at each other. 
LILA It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed. I froze last night. 
Ray holds up her hair revealing the cut over her eye. 
RAY I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal. 
LILA It's not a crime. 
RAY You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double. 
They stand staring at each other for a long moment, then Ray walks over and unties the rope around the bumpers of the Acclaim and the Horizon. 
LILA I don't usually work with whites. 
RAY Suit yourself. 
Ray gets in the driver's side of the Acclaim and starts it. After a moment, Lila gets in the passenger side. 
41   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY                         41 
Ray and Lila drive across the smooth surface of the river. Ray smokes with one hand and holds the gun with the other. 
LILA How many bedrooms? 
RAY Three. I got kids. 
LILA How old? 
RAY Five and Fifteen. 
LILA I got a boy. Almost one. 
Ray looks at her. 
LILA (CONT'D) He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a moment) She stole him from me. 
RAY Stole him? 
LILA Yeah. Right out of the hospital. 
RAY Stole him? 
LILA Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that. 
Lila looks out across the river at dusk with no expression. The ice looks clean and still. 
Ray picks up speed to climb the river bank. 
42   EXT. JIMMY'S GARAGE - DAY                                   42 
Ray and Lila drive up in the Acclaim. Thunder SPRINGS out again, caught by his CHAIN just short of the car. Ray flinches but keeps hold of the gun. 
Jimmy walks out to meet them. Lila rolls down her window. 
JIMMY Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told him no. 
LILA Thanks.

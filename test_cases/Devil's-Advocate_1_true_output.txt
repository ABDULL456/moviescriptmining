82   INT. MILTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                             82 
The penthouse. One enormous room. Grand scale everything. Otherworldly. Staggering. Of special, special interest: a huge Bas Relief dominates an entire wall. Carved into the marble are human forms -- young, naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds. 
Milton is on the phone. Two lines going. The dialogue is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway -- he's going back and forth between Korean and Russian -- brokering some emergency deal. 
Heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. Barzoon has a cigar. Kevin just standing there gaping at the space. 
KEVIN Is there more to it? 
BARZOON Just this room. 
KEVIN And a bedroom? 
BARZOON No bedroom. 
KEVIN Where does he sleep? 
HEATH Who said he sleeps? 
KEVIN Where does he fuck? 
MILTON (O.S.) (behind them) Everywhere. 
BARZOON What's up, John? 
MILTON How many hours did we bill Alex Cullen last year? 
HEATH Sixteen thousand, two hundred and forty-two.

BARZOON What the fuck did he do now? 
MILTON Alex Cullen has just been charged with murdering his ex- wife, her stepson, and a maid. 
BARZOON When did this happen? 
MILTON Just now. Tonight. I already sent Pam downtown to make bail arrangements.

BARZOON They'll fucking crucify him. They'll get in line. I gotta call Meisel... 
MILTON No.    I want Kevin on this case. 
BARZOON I hope you're kidding. (beat) Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple murder? With Kevin? You're dreaming. 
MILTON I've shaken hands with every marquee defense attorney in town. I take Kevin and I don't look back. 
BARZOON You're a great judge of talent, John. You're the master. I just don't see it coming together. 
MILTON I want you on board, Eddie. 
KEVIN Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but maybe Eddie's got a point here. 
MILTON We can get this case.   The man's our client. 
BARZOON He's a business client. 
MILTON We know him better than he knows himself. We have the inside track. We have the best damn trial lawyer in the city. It's ours to lose. 
BARZOON Tell it to Cullen. 
MILTON No.    That's up to Kevin.

With that, the PHONE starts RINGING -- 
MILTON That's Pam calling... (to Kevin) Are we fighting for this, or not?

It's late. Dark. Kevin tiptoeing through the apartment -- turning the corner and -- 
MARY ANN You left me there. I had a fucking panic attack until Jackie told me where you were. (raw) Three hours? You don't even call? 
KEVIN Stop. Reset. I'm upstairs, I'm with Milton and Barzoon and there is a very good possibility that I'm about to catch a triple homicide defendant who also happens to be the largest real estate developer in the city. I had to bail on the party! 
MARY ANN You bailed on me! 
KEVIN Mare... did you hear me? 
MARY ANN I was all by myself! 
KEVIN For three whole hours... (as she's walking) You gotta be kidding, right? 
No, she's leaving.    Kevin left there, alone --

A news van whipping up the block. TIRES SCREECHING as it pulls up beside a construction site where two other news vans are already unloading. The smell of headlines and --

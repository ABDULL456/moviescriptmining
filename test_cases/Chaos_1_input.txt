TEDDY No!   No, we have to go save him! 
DEKKER We can't. 
TEDDY We have to. 
DEKKER Teddy... 
TEDDY No! 
They both stare at the house.    Dekker holds her, she's a mess.

DISSOLVE TO: 
150   EXT.   HOUSE - 11:10 PM - NIGHT                                150 
FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene. FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames. 
Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story. 
A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still visible. They load him into the truck. 
TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck. 
JENKINS huddles with a group of Detectives. 
JENKINS ...   If it had to be someone... 
Teddy and Dekker overhear this. 
TEDDY (To Jenkins) You sonofabitch. 
JENKINS Teddy... 
TEDDY You've always been jealous of him. 
JENKINS Jealous? 
TEDDY It's because he wasn't only a better cop... He was a better man. 
JENKINS Detective.     Go home. 
Teddy really wants to explode, but doesn't. She walks away. Jenkins digests what she said, then his eyes find Dekker... 
JENKINS You have something you want to say?

DEKKER No, Captain. She said it perfectly. 
CUT TO: 
KAREN CROSS finds Teddy, has her Cameraman FOCUS in on her. 
KAREN CROSS Detective Galloway, could you give us a comment? 
Teddy looks STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA, but can't say a thing. That's when DEKKER grabs the camera, PUSHES it out of her face. 
KAREN CROSS We just wanted a statement. 
DEKKER Shame on you. 
KAREN CROSS This is more than just news for us. American National's CFO sits on the Board of Channel Two. They have a vested interest in what's going on. 
DEKKER Find another source. 
Karen and her Cameraman leave Teddy and Dekker alone. 
TEDDY Conners was right. We should've never gone in. How many more mistakes can we make in one day? He was eliminating his accomplices. We thought he was going to show up? We didn't even think he could do this... How dumb are we? 
151   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                      151 
Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk lamp... 
Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on the man, his career. He shuts off the lamp, heads for the door. 
DAX Detective? 
Dekker turns to find...       Dax, cradling a 3,000 PAGE DOCUMENT.

DAX I know what they were doing inside the bank.

{"train": "FADE IN: EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE \u00ad NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE AT NIGHT, THE LIGHTS OF THE CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY. EXT. WORKOUT AREA \u00ad SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES. His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads \"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu\".    What remains visible behind the poster and the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling around. INT. WORKOUT AREA \u00ad SAME NIGHT \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL. \nThe students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt. \nANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT \nStruggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside him. \nYOUNG ADULT \nSifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes... \nSifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he walks past the student. KWAN At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks trained in iron palm until our hands bled... (beat) \n... then we trained some more. He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind. YOUNG ADULT (getting back into horse stance) I guess not... \nANGLE ON KWAN As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and rearranges her hands. KWAN Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger! He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door. It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan. STUDENT Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Lee... \nKWAN \nBruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is effective. Show me. \nThe boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock. The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him. \nKWAN (CONT'D) \n(shaking his head) \nA Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never mind. \nHe continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door. Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS. RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously hand made, and on the back is embroidered: \"Kwan's Shaolin\" and underneath that is \"Drew Carson\". Kwan takes in the entire outfit, while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They are all very impressed. \nKWAN (CONT'D) Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez. I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de! This last he says looking at the empty door. MOTHER \nI only hope it brings him luck in the tournament. \nKWAN Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul \u00ad that's how they saved the T'ang emporer. He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering his students around him. KWAN (CONT'D) Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez. (to class) During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er... fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But, there was also time for individual training \u00ad where skills were honed like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you. \nHe turns to go. \nOne of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat. \nSTUDENT 2 \nWhat do you want us to do? \nKWAN \nWhen the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the cliff. Understand? \nSTUDENT 2 \nNo. \nThe others mutter \"No\" and shake their heads, confused. \nKWAN \nNo matter. He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him. \nThey look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do. EXT. DREW GARAGE \u00ad SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE. \nIt is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is candlelight inside, and it is moving around \u00ad an effect not unlike a ghost carrying a candelabra. \nINT. DREW GARAGE \u00ad SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR. The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW \nCARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot wax on his    skin (INSERT). In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie. ANGLE ON KWAN Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching Drew. ANGLE ON DREW As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV. Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the TV screen. \nThe grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite applause is COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED. \nANGLE ON TREVOR As he knocks out an opponent. ANGLE ON CROWD Applauding. ANGLE ON TREVOR Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique and puts the guy down and out. ANGLE ON TEAM (Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on. ANGLE ON TREVOR As he plays with the next fighter. \nTREVOR \nThey said you were good... ha! \nHe knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no denying that he's a superior fighter. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) \nCan't you get me any quality sparring partners? \nThe next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist, DR. PFEELGUT, calls for \"Time\" and motions Trevor over. \nPFEELGUT \nIt's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear you    forever. \nTrevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool. Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling. PFEELGUT (CONT'D) Exactly! Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy, alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to back up, laughing with the rest of the group. \nANGLE ON PFEELGUT Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor. PFEELGUT (CONT'D) \nGET HIM! NOW!! Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and (in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull his pants up. ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off. INT. TREVOR HOUSE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master, MASTER KIM, comes into the room. \nTREVOR \nAh, Master Kim. \n(to physiologist) \nI'll look at these stats later. \nTrevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) \nAre all you guys named Kim? So, what did you think? \nKIM \n(thick accent) \nYou velly good fighter... \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't know... KIM \nA mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is therefore vulnerable. TREVOR (after a beat) \nWell, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap. (beat) You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum. \nThe butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim. \nCHAUNCY Very good, sir. TREVOR Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to the left, Sam. The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly. TREVOR (CONT'D) It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure... EXT. COLISEUM \u00ad DAY People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front reads \"Diamond Nationals\". \nINT. COLISEUM \u00ad SAME DAY \nESTABLISHING MONTAGE OF TOURNAMENT: CROWDS AND COMPETITORS. \n(SOME IDEAS, NOT IN ORDER) \nCompetitors warming up (wall front stretch, very high; one guy kicking another in the head \u00ad tap, tap, tap; two man routine practicing \u00ad another one jumps in?; two beautiful girls sparring; crowd assembling; group of kids waiting \u00ad call comes over public address system, they run off; stand outside selling high tech equipment; different styles of fighter's clothes \u00ad camo, stars & stripes, \"headhunter\"; stern 9 year old girl doing kata; two toddlers barely seen through their safety equipment fighting furiously; two twins doing identical kata; breaking; etc.) \nANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN \nWalk into the area \u00ad Drew is dressed in the ill-fitting handmade suit by Mrs. Rodriguez. People recognize him as he walks past. \nANGLE ON TREVOR Making his entrance. He is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit, and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go. COMPETITOR \nChina. DREW You mean... all the stories...? KWAN (nodding) Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other people. DREW Why are you telling me this? KWAN \nI've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have all the potential in the world, but I can't take you where you want to go. \nKwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where it was with a cotton ball. \nKWAN (CONT'D) \nThere, that should control the swelling. \nHe watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said. \nDREW \nSo you're not a Shaolin? \nKWAN \nNo. \nDREW Never were? \nKWAN No. Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this. \nKWAN (CONT'D) What? DREW \nIf you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one. KWAN \nWhat are you talking about? DREW I'm going to the Shaolin Temple \u00ad they can train me so I will never lose like that again. Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's eyes. KWAN He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold cloth. He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down. DREW (eyes intent) \nDon't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right training \u00ad    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple. \nKwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew. \nKWAN \nI must pay for your ticket... \nDREW \nNo! I'll make it there myself. \nKWAN \nI grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be those stories. You can live my dream for me \u00ad at least let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble he's caused. Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew nods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner. DREW Master... MONTAGE OF DEPARTURE ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN AS KWAN HANDS HIM A \"NORTHWEST AIRLINES\" TICKET. ANGLE ON DREW \nAs he packs for China. ANGLE ON KWAN AND DREW As Kwan drops drew off at the AIRPORT. Drew takes his suitcase and \nwalks into the airport. EXT. CHANG AN LU \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW RUNNING ALONG BEIJING'S CHANG AN LU, A SEA OF BICYCLES AROUND HIM. Bicycle bells ring loudly as figures dressed in the same drab clothes ride around him, their faces covered with scarves and surgical masks against the northern China dirt. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL TIAN AN MEN SQUARE and the huge photo of CHAIRMAN MAO on the front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City. Drew continues his run, past a group of western-dressed lyou mang, who watch him run by through dark glasses. Drew runs through a large city park, stopping to watch a group of older citizens going through Tai Zhi routines under the weeping willow trees there. \nDrew runs through an open air food market, picking his way through flipping fish, dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables. People yell at each other, trying to get the best price. Young man brushing his teeth in the street. A group of toddlers, strung together with rope, walks down the street, their split pants showing glimpses of bare bottoms as they walk. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION \u00ad SAME DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED TRAIN, PEOPLE PUSHING AND SHOVING TO GET ON. \nDrew walks up to it, a huge backpack on his back. He hesitates a moment, then starts forcing his way onto the train like everyone else. He manages to get in through a window. \nINT. CROWDED TRAIN \u00ad SAME DAY \nThere are no seats. Drew takes his pack off and sits on it. \nNext to him is an old man, his teeth red and rotted from betel nut juice. The man smiles at Drew. EXT. CHINA COUNTRYSIDE \u00ad DAY \nTRAIN RUSHING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE. DREW POV EXT. COUNTRYSIDE \u00ad DAY Drew watches the countryside go by. Temples, farms and rice paddies slide by, with an occasionally glimpse of the Great Wall. EXT. GREAT WALL \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, BACKPACK ON, AS HE WALKS ON THE GREAT WALL. EXT. CHINA COUNTRYSIDE \u00ad NIGHT TRAIN RUSHING THROUGH DARKENED COUNTRYSIDE. \nINT. LUOYANG TRAIN STATION \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW GETTING OFF THE TRAIN. He stops on the platform for a moment, a huge colorful Chinese billboard in the b.g. A transit cop quickly comes up to him and prods him into motion. Drew walks on, passing a sign that reads \"Luoyang\". EXT. CHINESE STREETS \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE. He stops at    a drink stand and orders one. As soon as he stops, he is ringed with    people watching his every move \u00ad he feels almost like a movie star.    The woman in the stand hands him a drink, and takes the money out of    his hand. DREW Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin? \nThe woman just smiles and shakes her head, not comprehending. \nDrew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it all sink in. \nAfter a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front door. He pulls it open and disappears inside. INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR. \nThe muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half light takes over. He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of temple shots, establishing the feeling of the \ntemple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of Bodhidharma, etc. No one is around. Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING. Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes are open, but they don't seem to see him. He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall. He goes into a corridor, then passes the \"Wooden Man Chamber\". \nHE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP. HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAINING OUTSIDE (O.S.). HE WALKS OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SOUNDS. \nEXT. TRAINING AREA \u00ad SAME DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA. \nAll manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men, posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams, etc.). \nA monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood. \nThe post TREMBLES with every strike. \nDrew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk takes no notice of him. \nDREW \nExcuse me, Master. No answer. DREW (CONT'D) \nHello? Busy, huh? Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post, over and over. Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes are on either side of him. He can see the \"pagoda forest\" in the distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the path. Drew walks up to the monk and bows. DREW (CONT'D) \nMaster, may I ask you a question? No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment. DREW (CONT'D) What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple? Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you? Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter? He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed. He walks back into the chanting chamber. INT. TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat, until they stop chanting. Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands. \nDREW \nThat was great! Great! \nThe monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked. \nMONK 1 \nNo tourists! Temple closed! \nDREW \nSo you can see me?!? \nSeveral monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit. \nMONK 1 \n(very agitated) \nNo tourists! No tourists! \nDrew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention. DREW (CONT'D) \nI'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk! The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk, and they have a short conversation in Chinese. ADMISSIONS MONK That's not possible. DREW What do you mean, sir? \nADMISSIONS MONK The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is no foreigners. \nDREW I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk. ADMISSIONS MONK What people want and what they can have are often not the same. DREW Not in this case. MONK Oh, yes, especially in this case. DREW \nI'm not leaving. \nDrew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is going to hold his breath until he turns blue. \nMONK \nYou give me no choice. \n(to other monks) \nDREW \nI'm camping out. \nHe starts away from the stand. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nIn front of the temple. \nHe walks off into the Chinese night. \nEXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad EARLY MORN \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF MIST-LADEN COURTYARD. \nThe sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged in front of the door. \nIt is Drew, backpack at his side. The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around, and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he quickly disappears inside. Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there. ADMISSIONS MONK \nGo home! You cannot stay here! No response from Drew. He just sits there, staring straight ahead. ADMISSIONS MONK (CONT'D) \nDo you hear me? Go away! Drew doesn't move. San De, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind \nhim carrying a suitcase. He walks past Drew, noticing him sitting there. He walks on. The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry. EXT. TEMPLE \u00ad MONTAGE SECTION ANGLE ON DREW SWEATING IN THE HOT SUNSHINE Sweat is running into Drew's eyes, and he is trying to keep them from stinging. ANGLE ON DREW BEING TORMENTED BY LOCAL KIDS They are playing games around him, throwing stones at him, messing with his hair and his clothes, touching the things in his backpack (frisbee, football, walkman), etc. ANGLE ON DRILL SERGEANT \nAs he comes out of the temple, chasing away the kids. \nWhen they are gone, he turns to Drew. \nDRILL SERGEANT \nWill you give up? I think so. \nANGLE ON DREW SHIVERING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT \nHis eyes are closed, and it is obvious he is very uncomfortable. \nANGLE ON SPIDER AS IT CRAWLS OUT TO SEE DREW \nIt lingers for a moment, then goes away. \nANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA \nShe is giving him food, and all he is moving is his mouth. They do not speak. \nANGLE ON DREW SITTING IN THE RAIN \nHe is miserable, and he is looking at the relative comfort of the stands around the temple, where there is food, warmth and light. His spirit is wavering. \nANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA AGAIN ASHEMA Give this up, Drew! Please? \nNo response from Drew. Just a small smile. ANGLE ON SPIDER, WHO IS BACK This time it stays even longer. Drew looks down at it and smiles. ANGLE ON MONKS FROM TEMPLE Looking out the windows at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard. \nANGLE ON DREW IN COURTYARD As a school group comes through the temple. The children are tied together with a rope, and the teacher motions to the crazy American. Drew has become an attraction! ANGLE ON DREW, SURROUNDED BY OLD MEN They are marveling at his perserverance. ANGLE ON DREW, WIND AND RAIN This time it doesn't seem to bother him so much. ANGLE ON DREW WITH ASHEMA AND HER BAU BAU THERE Bau Bau speaks quickly in Chinese. ASHEMA (CONT'D) \nMy Bau Bau says, keep it up! He is proud of you... \nDrew nods. \nANGLE ON DREW SURROUNDED BY KIDS \nThey are no longer tormenting him, they are playing around and with him. Drew is not moving, but he is part of their group. \nANGLE ON DREW, THE SPIDER NOW SITTING ON HIS HAND \nDrew stares at the spider, his companion in the vigil. \nANGLE ON DREW, BIRDS ALL AROUND HIM \nThe line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack in hand, takes his place at the end of the line. \nThey parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside the temple. \nAs they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are put out by the fact that Drew is among them. \nSeveral of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple are openly hostile to him. \nThey file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple. \nA gong sounds, and the questions begin. \nANGLE ON FIRST DISCIPLE Who is asked... \nMONK Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs? DISCIPLE 1 \nYes, without pause. ANGLE ON DREW MONK Do you renounce the earthly world? DREW \nSure do, master. You bet. \nThe monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question. The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the monk then continues. MONK Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it means death? DREW I do. The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side with his elbow. DRILL SERGEANT (whispering) \nAnswer \"Yes, without pause.\" \nDREW \n(rubbing his side) \nYes, without pause. \nANGLE ON ANOTHER DISCIPLE \nMONK \nWho is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple? \nDISCIPLE 2 \nBodhidharma. \nANGLE ON DREW \nMONK \nDo you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your spiritual leaders? DREW Yes, without pause. The Drill Sergeant nods his head. MONK \nWill a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal gain? \nDrew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him on. DREW Yes, without pause. \nThe D.S. puts his hands over his eyes. DREW (CONT'D) I mean, no, of course not. Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. It is San De! San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then clears his throat. Everyone stands up again. \nSAN DE \nDo these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin Temple? \nDRILL SERGEANT \nYes, without pause, Master San De. \nANGLE ON DREW \nWho now knows that the monk he called a \"Janitor\" is the headmaster! \nDREW \n(under his breath) \nI'll be damned! \nINT. DORM \u00ad NIGHT \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS, AS THE MONKS FILE IN, LED BY THE D.S. \nA number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's. \nGAO \nI want another bed. \nD.S. \nWhy? \nGAO (CONT'D) \nI won't sleep next to the American. D.S. We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk. GAO (CONT'D) \nWell, this monk smells! Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head. Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned. LI I will switch with Disciple Gao. \nD.S. nods, and then starts for the door. D.S. Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training tomorrow. Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very secretively since the D.S. is watching. DREW Jerk! Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and Drew stares up at the ceiling. DREW (CONT'D) \nThanks for what you did. \nLI \nWhere are you from? \nDREW \nNew York City. You? \nLI \nBeijing. What is New York like? \nDREW \nAmazing. I'll tell you about... \nGAO \nShut UP! \nDREW Blow me! \nDrew waits for a moment, fearful that the D.S. will be coming back in. He doesn't. DREW (CONT'D) Good night, Li. \nLI Wan an. DISSOLVE TO: \nANGLE ON DREW, SLEEPING All is quiet. \nSuddenly, a huge stick ENTERS FRAME, and it pauses for a moment above Drew, before THUMPING down on top of him. Drew cries out when he is hit, and jumps out of bed, looking all around him. No one is there. A few of the disciples are moving around because he yelled, but there is nothing else there. Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is coming. ANGLE ON GAO Who seems to be sleeping peacefully. ANGLE ON DREW As he climbs back into bed, bone-weary. He lies back down to sleep. INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad MORNING \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF LATRINE. \nDrew stumbles in, bleary-eyed,    to relieve himself. He stands at the urinal, relaxing as he starts.    Suddenly, a huge stick WHACKS Drew across the rear end, the SOUND    reverberating through the latrine. Drew yelps and jumps, looking    around for the attacker. \nNo one is there, and his underwear is now all wet. \nINT. DINING ROOM \u00ad SAME DAY \nESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF RICE GRUEL (\"WATER RICE\"), A SPOON STIRRING THE MEAGER MIXTURE. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting with Li and some other disciples. \nDrew makes a face. \nDREW \nAny problems? \nDrew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly. \nANGLE ON DREW \nAs he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the D.S. is there in front of him. \nHe examines the baskets. They are not full. He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt. \nDREW (shocked) What'd you do that for? D.S. Do a job well or don't do it. \nANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full, then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head. \nD.S. Sorry, all gone. Get some more. Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to himself. DREW (CONT'D) I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah... Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM. \nOnce they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders are straining from the weight of the buckets. \nHe goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for him. \nDrew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S. motions for him to put the buckets down. \nWithout thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the ground. \nDREW \nDon't tell me, I know. Get more water... \nINT. DORM ROOM \u00ad NIGHT \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES ALL IN BED. They are exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes wide open, ready to get attacked.

He is balancing as he walks. ANGLE ON GAO Who is working at the other end. He starts across the same ridge. \nThey come to the middle: a stand off. GAO Back up and let me pass. DREW No chance, Gao. You back up. Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and continues walking. CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S. walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out. \nD.S. \n(heartlessly) \nShaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you will be fine. \nHe walks away. \nANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES \nOn a work break. They are watching the monks training in the distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable. \nIn the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks. They are leading him out. \nThe monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim. \nLi turns to the D.S. LI \nWhat happened? D.S. He failed to pass through the wooden man chamber. He must leave the temple. The D.S. walks off. LI (CONT'D) The \"Wooden Man Chamber\"! The ultimate test of a Shaolin monk... WU \nDid you see his face? \nSHU Poor guy. GAO He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if half of us go out the same way. The D.S. appears and motions for them to work. INT. MEDITATION HALL \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES, DREW IN THE MIDDLE, SITTING IN ROWS IN THE INCENSE-FILLED MEDITATION CHAMBER. The monk in charge of the chamber is talking to them.

DORM AREA \u00ad NIGHT \nANGLE ON DREW \nWho is holding court. \nDREW \nWe came here to train, not to be slaves! We're free men... \nMU But we swore to obey them... DREW \nAn uninformed choice is no choice at all! MU Huh? \nDREW We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even know we're dissatisfied, things will never change. GAO \nThey haven't changed for centuries, why should we listen to you? DREW Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd? WU I'm with you! The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to explode, and Drew has the match. DREW I'm for going to the Headmaster right now! They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move. Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nYou're either with us, Gao, or you're against us. \nNo answer from Gao. They exit the room. \nINT. HALLWAY \u00ad SAME NIGHT \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND THE BOYS RUSHING DOWN THE CORRIDOR, HEADING FOR SAN DE'S QUARTERS. \nANGLE ON D.S. \nHeading for the same place but from a different direction. \nINT. SHAOLIN HALLWAY \u00ad SAME NIGHT \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE SAN DE'S CHAMBERS. \nDrew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them. \nDREW Master San De! SAN DE \nWho else? DREW We have something to say... \nSAN DE This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all. DREW \nI request permission to go first. SAN DE I think I'd better... DREW No, really, I want to... San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority. SAN DE Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be given chores every    day \u00ad remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble. \nANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES \nWho tonight have been anything but humble. \nSAN DE (CONT'D) \nYou've all performed    admirably, and have learned an important lesson \u00ad to    obey your shr fu without question. Because of this, I've    decided to begin your martial training sooner than    what is prescribed. Tomorrow morning. \nThe disciples can hardly believe their luck. \nSAN DE (CONT'D) \nAnd, what did you have to say to me? \nANGLE ON DREW \nWho is sputtering now. \nDREW \nANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES He is going through a complex form, kicking and punching, never missing or faltering a step. Some of the poles are as high as 6 feet off the ground. ANGLE ON GAO ON THE POLES He is less sure, but at least he doesn't fall. \nANGLE ON DREW Trying the poles. He starts out well, but he soon misses and falls, almost impaling himself on a pole. DREW I can't do this! D.S. Here at Shaolin, can't doesn't exist. Only won't. EXT. TRAINING AREA \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF. Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to blocked by a special Shaolin technique. \nEach time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD. \nHis block isn't working. A monk comes up to him. \nMONK \nBlock the way I showed you. \nDREW \n(showing him a block) \nThis is the way I was taught. \nMONK (CONT'D) \nDo it this way. You won't get hit. \nDrew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time, however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew. \nDrew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily deflect Drew's kick. GAO (menacingly) My turn. He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao. Gao stands over him, smiling. \nEXT. TRAINING AREA \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING KICKS, AERIALS, ETC. A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and \nkipping up. Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no trouble. Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist. MONK Emotions cloud the spirit \u00ad eliminate them. DREW This isn't martial arts \u00ad it's gymnastics! MONK This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue. \nDrew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper. \nEXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA. \nThe entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete floor. D.S. stands in the middle. \nD.S. \nI want to go over some takedowns before we end for the day. I'll need a partner... \nHe scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully, walks to the front and bows to D.S. \nD.S. \nWatch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling. \nDREW (looking at ground) Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here. D.S. Do they always use mats in America? \nThe group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now challenged. \nD.S. (CONT'D) If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao would assist me... ANGLE ON GAO \nWho is already getting up, ready and willing. This changes Drew's mind right away. ANGLE ON DREW AND D.S. DREW Let's do it. D.S. Attack me straight on... Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow. Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack. \nANGLE ON THE GROUP \nWho can barely watch the destruction. \nANGLE ON THE FIGHT \nThe D.S. does not let up at all, taking \nDrew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more. \nFinally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of all of them, the D.S. calls it a day. \nD.S. \nDrew shakes his head and gets back up. \nD.S. \nSwitch! \nNow it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls. \nDrew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over. \nMONK \nThe goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just try to tap his chest. \nDREW \nI know, but... \nMONK Then do it that way... The Monk walks away, shaking his head. \nEXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad EVENING ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE. Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying watching him. To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall. \nDREW This sure beats sweeping... \nANGLE ON FRISBEE Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely missing them. Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it dead center, right in the face. The statue starts to tip! Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips over and smashes on the ground. They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S. coming towards them. Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms. \nHe tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S. rounds the corner. \nThe D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent. \nD.S. \nSweep the main chamber, Drew. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nYes, master. \nHe bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training chamber. \nINT. CHAMBER \u00ad SAME EVENING \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER. \nThis is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it. \nHe walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and stands staring at it. \nQUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting. ANGLE ON DREW Who begins to sweep. \nHis broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form, his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor. He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a microphone. DREW \n(imitating an announcer) Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the Shaolin temple... Drew Carson! Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary crowd. DREW The crowd is going wild. Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into Drew's unprotected stomach! Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee, and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach. Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and sends him pitching to the floor. \nANGLE ON DREW \nAs he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept up. \nEXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad EVENING \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, THE SUN SETTING IN THE DISTANCE. \nDrew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in which he is made to look extremely fierce. \nSan De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment. \nSAN DE \nHe was an amazing monk... \nHe bows to Bau Bau and then they walk off. \nThey walk through the small town, checking it out. They walk through the countryside, enjoying their freedom. \nDrew has brought a frisbee with him, and they are tossing it around. EXT. LUOYANG CAVES \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP AS THEY WALK IN THE HILLS HOUSING THE FAMOUS LUO YANG CAVES. The hills are filled with Buddhist carvings.

Drew stops to watch them, then looks back at the others. They all shake their heads. Drew nods his. They continue to shake their heads. Drew starts running towards the kids, stripping off his shirt at the same time. The others pause for a moment, then follow his lead. ANGLE ON GROUP As they swing into the river, trying to keep their hats on as they splash into the water. they are having the time of their life. ANGLE ON GROUP \nResting on the bank of the river. Drew and the guys spot a group of girls down the bank from them. \nDREW \nCheck it out, guys! \nWU \nGirls! \nDREW \nGood work, Wu. What tipped you off? \nLI \n(alarmed) \nWe are not allowed to have contact with females. It is the most serious rule of the temple. \nDREW \nIt's a stupid rule, Li. But... He is about to turn away, then spots Ashema as she runs down a path to the group of girls. He stands up immediately and starts over to her. He is jogging, at the same time trying to straighten his clothes and his hat. Li starts running after Drew. The others follow. DREW (CONT'D) ASHEMA! \nANGLE ON ASHEMA Who hears her name. She looks around, sees Drew but doesn't immediately recognize him. She looks around the park. \nDREW (CONT'D) ASHEMA! Here! She looks at Drew again, and this time recognizes him. Drew arrives and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her. Li arrives and pulls them apart. DREW (CONT'D) What!?! LI You can get kicked out of the temple for this... DREW Who's going to tell, Li? You? \nHe turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling. \nDREW \n(pointing at girls) \nNot the giggle girls again! How've you been? You look great! \nASHEMA \n(hiding a laugh) \nYou look... funny. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nThanks. \nASHEMA \nHow do you like the temple? DREW \nShhh... nobody's supposed to know. Li tugs at Drew's shirt. LI We really shouldn't be doing this... DREW \nI'm trying to show you guys a good time. (to Ashema) I guess I gotta go. It was great to see you. \nOne of the giggle girls behind Ashema whispers something in her ear. She nods and smiles. ASHEMA My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you and your friends come? Li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies, but Drew smiles and takes Ashema's hand. The girls start to giggle again. He brings her hand up to his lips, and kisses it gently. DREW We'll be there. INT. DORM ROOM \u00ad NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, LI STANDING IN FRONT OF DREW, THE REST OF THE DISCIPLES GATHERED AROUND. \nThe room is dark \u00ad it's after lights out. \nLI \nAllright!

TRAINING AREA \u00ad DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES WORKING ON THE UNBENDABLE ARM. \nDrew is in the middle, and Gao is straining to bend his relaxed arm. He is getting the hang of it. \nThe D.S. walks up with another monk with    a spear. Together, they position a wooden target. The monk bows    to D.S. and to the rest of the disciples, then positions the point    of the spear in the hollow of his neck. He then hands the shaft of the    spear to the D.S. \nThe D.S. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear, slowly but surely. \nANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES Amazed. \nANGLE ON THE MONK The spear is now almost bent double. With a flick of his head, the spear goes flying into the target positioned behind him, its point finding the bulls-eye. \nDrew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point is imbedded deep into the wood of the target. \nDREW (bowing) Boy, his spirit is strong... \nEXT. TEMPLE GROUNDS \u00ad DAY 120 (SPRING TIME) TIGHT SHOT OF AMERICAN FOOTBALL SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR. Set against a deep blue sky, it could be spinning anywhere \u00ad but the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Shaolin Temple \"forest of stupa\", where the disciples are having a pick up football game \u00ad it's Sunday, the disciples' afternoon off. The football spins into the hands of Gao, who drops it. Drew runs over, showing Gao how to catch the ball, and how to make the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over). Gao follows Drew's instructions, then they run the play. This time Gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown. Drew runs up and high-fives Gao, then teaches him how to spike the ball. They are playing some more, having a great time. This time Drew goes out for a pass, with Gao playing defense. Li throws the pass, and Gao intercepts. Drew, laughing, goes after Gao. \nANGLE ON DREW \nWho goes long for a pass, which Gao lets fly. \nIt is immediately obvious that it is way too long. \nANGLE ON SAN DE \nWho is walking along through the stupa, meditating as he walks. \nANGLE ON DREW \nWho stops running and sees san de. the ball is going towards San De. \nANGLE ON SAN DE \nThe ball is heading right for his HEAD! \nANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND OTHERS \nThey are bracing for the impact, and the trouble it will cause. ANGLE ON SAN DE Who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional receiver. He holds the ball and looks right at Drew, a very stern look on his face. ANGLE ON DREW \nExpecting the worst. ANGLE ON SAN DE His stern face now taking on a mischevious look. He hefts the ball and puts his fingers on the laces. \nSAN DE \nGo long. Drew pauses for a moment, not sure    what San De said, until San De motions with his left hand, like a    NFL quarterback, for Drew to go out. He takes off sprinting, with    Gao covering him like a blanket. San De throws the ball to him in a    perfect spiral, to a spot where Gao has no play on the throw, and    Drew catches it in stride. San De immediately returns to his meditation, while Drew and the others stand around dumbstruck. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO, LI AND DREW RUNNING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE. They come to a stream, and there by a stream is a beautiful young woman who can't get across the stream without getting her clothes soaked. \nWithout thinking twice, Drew allows her to get on his back and carries her across the river. He deposits her on the other side and then continues running. \nGao and Li run up next to Drew, and together they go back to the temple. When they stop outside the temple, they are breathing heavily. finally catching his breath, Gao turns to Drew. \nGAO \nI can't believe you carried that girl over the stream! After all the trouble you got into... \nWho have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take the things from them, and start to walk off. \nThe father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face. \nBefore he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his wrist, stopping it. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nOh, I don't think so... \nANGLE ON THE CROWD \nIt's getting good now. The fight    starts, and this    time Drew is unencumbered by    vows of non- violence.    He has a cause,    and he's enjoying every minute    of the fight. It    is over quickly,    as Drew is a superb fighter,    using incredible    techniques. The    thugs limp away, leaving Drew    with the little boy    and his father. \nDrew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy, looking deep into his eyes. A whisper is going through the crowd: \"Shaolin\". Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He moves on, the crowd watching him walk away. HOLD ON BOY'S FACE He now has a hero. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE \u00ad DAY ANGLE ON DREW WALKING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE.

As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he strips off his clothes and dives into the lake. \nAs Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes. \nDrew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked \u00ad he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore as he can without coming out of the water. \nThe woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has on. She is very sexy. \nDREW \nNo, don't do that! \nWOMAN Why not? \nDREW I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain... WOMAN \nNo one will know... DREW I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please. Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge. DREW (CONT'D) \nNice throw... ANGLE ON DREW Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him. He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye. DREW (CONT'D) Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream come true, I can't! He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting. DREW (CONT'D) Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with you. \nHe kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his clothes, running up the path away from the lake. \nEXT. TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE. \nDrew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment, then takes a drink of water from the well out front. \nJust as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple, jostling Drew from side to side. \nTOURIST 1 \nNot another temple! \nTOURIST 2 Do they have a gift shop? \nTOURIST 3 Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'? GUIDE \nYou have 10 minutes to be back on the bus. The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk, and turn back to Drew. TOURIST 1 A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture! \nThe tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the \nfirst pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him, he raises his hands up to his face and bows. DREW Oh Mi Two Fwo He then turns and walks away. GUIDE (O.S.) Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a different world. DREW I'll say... EXT. WATERFALL \u00ad EARLY MORNING \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL. \nDrew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get where he is going. \nDrew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall is incedible \u00ad steep and deadly. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nOf course, you're right. No excuses... \nDrew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the temple. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nYou have it? How? \nThe Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nSo, I didn't fail, huh? \n(beat) \nI can ask my question, then? \nThe Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes. DREW (CONT'D) What is the meaning of life? \nThe Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles on his head and stands up. \nARHAT What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat. He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer. DREW (smiling ruefully) \nI just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning of life. He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head. ARHAT For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese. DREW No. American. ARHAT I notice the littlest details. DREW \nHow many succeeded? \nARHAT \nA handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious than human life. \nDREW \nBut, I didn't obey. \nARHAT \n(smiling slightly) \nAt the beginning of your training, you were to obey without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must learn to question everything, and obey yourself. \nDrew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in the b.g. \nDISSOLVE TO: EXT.

The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve \nand pulls him over to a place behind his hut. DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT A road! After all he went through to get there? ARHAT (CONT'D) Bus stops every 20 min., will take you straight to the temple. Drew smiles and shakes his head, then bows to the Arhat. The Arhat returns the bow. DREW Thank you, Master. ARHAT \nThey should give you a bus schedule with that map... \nHe walks off to the hut, while Drew makes his way down to the bus stop. \nEXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING BACK INTO THE TEMPLE. \nHe is dirty, weary but triumphant. As he walks back through the temple to San De's chambers to report, he sees a group of people walking out the other way. \nThe group is made up of the thugs who attacked him, the woman by the lake, and the man from the bridge. They are talking together on their way out. \nANGLE ON DREW \nDrew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving. \nDrew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues, letting his arms practice for the attacks. \nThere is fear in his eyes. \nHe starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are different this time. \nDrew is clobbered. \nDriven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is already bruised and bleeding. DREW (whispering) I can't do it. FLASHBACK TO D.S. \nD.S. There is no can't, only won't. FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS \nIncluding the one where Drew succeeded in evading them. \nANGLE ON DREW Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing it out in a breathing exercise. DREW (CONT'D) I am a Shaolin monk. He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically). He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across. He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way. \nSuddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him. \nThey THWOCK into the wall, sticking there. \nAs he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others, and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on. \nHe goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out the door. \nDrew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously, expecting a trap or a trick. \nNothing happens. \nHe gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand. \nImmediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck. Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly. The panel drops lower and lower. FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE \nANGLE ON DREW As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body, letting his inner energy take over. ANGLE ON PANEL \nAs it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops. \nANGLE ON DREW Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body completely relaxed. The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens. The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up with a hook kick and taps it in the face. DREW (CONT'D) Not this time. Drew quickly walks through the door. EXT. TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHEERING ASSEMBLAGE, SAN DE AND D.S. AT THE FRONT.

STANDING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED DISCIPLES. \nThere are a few missing from their ranks, monks who did not make it through the chamber, but the majority of them are there. The entire temple is gathered to watch the ceremony. \nSan De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes. \nAfter he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements, including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his hands \nSAN DE You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as fighting monks... A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all around. ANGLE ON REAR OF COURTYARD \nWhere a huge red sheet is pulled back to reveal tables laden with Chinese dishes, wine and other foods. \nThe party gets going and is soon in full gear. ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND LI As they congratulate themselves, and gorge themselves on the huge \ntables of Chinese food. ANGLE ON THE ENTIRE GROUP They are enjoying themselves. This only happens once every couple of years, and the monks are intent on enjoying themselves. ANGLE ON SAN DE (DREW'S POV) Who is walking towards the side of the temple, away from the party.

Drew walks up to him and they bow. \nWho finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique, and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND THE OTHERS. \nThe referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory. Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD: \nTREVOR (CONT'D) \nI'M NOT DONE! \nThe crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) \nI want HIM! \nHe points right at Drew. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) \nI want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I want to learn at the hands of a master! \nThe crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while, warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin to face Trevor. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) I want the American Shaolin! ANGLE ON DREW \nWho doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. \nANGLE ON TREVOR Pointing and yelling for Drew. ANGLE ON DREW \nWho climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks over to Trevor. DREW I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again. TREVOR So, let's see what you've learned. DREW (shaking his head) I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) \nBull! You're just chicken! \nDREW \nThe arts should never be about who is best \u00ad they are too important for that. \nHe bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring. \nANGLE ON CROWD \nThey don't know what's going on. \nANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS \nThey don't know either. They want Drew to fight him. \nANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S. Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they have ever been. TREVOR \nCOME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away! Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes. SAN DE \nDo you turn away from him out of fear? ANGLE ON TREVOR Who is seething. \nTREVOR \nI thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies! Look at him \u00ad he is too scared to face me! ANGLE ON DREW His face calm. DREW No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego. SAN DE You have learned much. ANGLE ON TREVOR TREVOR \nThe Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha! \nANGLE ON SAN DE \nWho indicates trevor with a inclination of his head. \nSAN DE \nYou did the right thing. \nANGLE ON TREVOR \n", "test1_input": "D.S. Stop! Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring daggers at each other. D.S. (to others) Back to work. He turns and walks off, motioning for Drew and Gao to follow him. Drew follows immediately, with Gao behind him. Gao shoves him once. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, GAO AND SAN DE IN THE SHADOWS OF SAN DE'S ROOM. \nSan De is sitting down reading a Buddhist text. With a sigh, he puts it down. On the wall behind is hanging a Golden Sash. \nSAN DE \nSo soon? \n(beat) \nTell me what happened. \nDrew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks. \nDREW \nIt was my fault. I started it. \nANGLE ON GAO \nSurprised at Drew's confession. \nDREW (CONT'D) Disciple Gao was better than me. Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation. DREW (CONT'D) I lost my temper. He was only defending himself. \nANGLE ON SAN DE Who nods his head and looks at Drew. SAN DE \nIs this true, Disciple Gao? Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him, nodding for him to say yes. \nGAO Yes. But, I am not completely blameless... SAN DE I didn't think you were... (beat) The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best \u00ad we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger. (beat) Shake hands and let your emotions go. \nGao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept away in the shock of Drew taking the blame. \nThey shake hands. \nBoth Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is occupying a place of honor. \nSAN DE (CONT'D) \nThat is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple. It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle of understanding. \nDREW \nThe best fighter? \nSAN DE \nAmong other things. Fighting is only a small part of being a Shaolin monk. GAO \nYours? San De nods. SAN DE \nReturn to your training. Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door. They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door. \nFinally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao. DREW \nTen more seconds and I would have kicked your ass... Gao smiles and walks through the door. Just as he passes Drew, he punches him in the stomach. GAO In your dreams... INT.

He turns to where Gao is standing, all alone. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nGao, you coming or what? \nThere is a moment of indecision, then Gao frowns, shakes his head and comes jogging towards them. \nGAO \nI'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble! \nEXT.

They    are about halfway across from the front door of the temple    when a    monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and bobbing    \u00ad he    looks drunk. \nDrew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple? They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and Gao are standing, but he walks on. \nGAO \n(whisper) Drunken Kung Fu... Drew nods and leads them out of the temple. EXT.

A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room, observing everything that's going on. ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA DREW Great party... \nAshema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a cassette tape, gives it to Ashema \nDREW (CONT'D) Play this when I signal, OK? She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls DREW (CONT'D) Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of China... He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls. DREW (CONT'D) This is Gao. And this wild man is Li... Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment.

TOUGH \nLeave. ANGLE ON DISCIPLES. They have noticed what is going on. ANGLE ON DREW DREW No, thanks. He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD.

He does not tense up his arm and shoulder. \nGao looks questioning at the D.S. \nGAO \nWhat if I hurt him? \nD.S. \nYou will not. \nGao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his expression of relaxation and piece has not changed. \nGao quits, not able to bend the arm. D.S. motions for Drew to get on the other side of the monk. \nD.S. \nGrab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance. Drew and Gao shrug at each other and take an arm. They pull and push, straining and groaning, but there is no movement from the old monk. It is like he is a heavy stone. They give up, and the D.S. bows to the old monk. D.S.

He is coming up, but then is crashing back down onto his spine. The D.S. comes up to him and points at his chest. D.S. Try to hit me here with your feet. DREW With pleasure. Drew tries another kip, pushing his feet towards the D.S.' chest. He lands on his feet easily, surprised. EXT. WATERFALL \u00ad DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND GAO UNDER THE WATERFALL.

From out of nowhere comes the staff, swinging for Drew. \nDrew doesn't jump, but just calmly avoids it. The staff WHOOSHES over his head. Drew stands up, and the staff comes again, from a different direction. Drew avoids, and the staff finds empty air again. \nDrew goes on with cleaning the plates, a slight smile on his face. After a BEAT, he looks around, trying to find the attacker. When he is sure no one is around, he smiles bigger. DREW \n", "test3_id": 1247}

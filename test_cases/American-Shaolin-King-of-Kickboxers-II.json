He pulls it open and disappears inside. INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR. \nThe muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half light takes over. He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of temple shots, establishing the feeling of the \ntemple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of Bodhidharma, etc. No one is around. Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING. Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes are open, but they don't seem to see him. He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall. He goes into a corridor, then passes the \"Wooden Man Chamber\". \nHE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP. HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAINING OUTSIDE (O.S.). HE WALKS OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SOUNDS. \nEXT. TRAINING AREA \u00ad SAME DAY \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA. \nAll manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men, posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams, etc.). \nA monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood. \nThe post TREMBLES with every strike. \nDrew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk takes no notice of him. \nDREW \nExcuse me, Master. No answer. DREW (CONT'D) \nHello? Busy, huh? Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post, over and over. Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes are on either side of him. He can see the \"pagoda forest\" in the distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the path. Drew walks up to the monk and bows. DREW (CONT'D) \nMaster, may I ask you a question? No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment. DREW (CONT'D) What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple? Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you? Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter? He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed. He walks back into the chanting chamber. INT. TEMPLE \u00ad SAME DAY The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat, until they stop chanting. Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands. \nDREW \nThat was great! Great! \nThe monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked. \nMONK 1 \nNo tourists! Temple closed! \nDREW \nSo you can see me?!? \nSeveral monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit. \nMONK 1 \n(very agitated) \nNo tourists! No tourists! \nDrew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention. DREW (CONT'D) \nI'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk! The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk, and they have a short conversation in Chinese. ADMISSIONS MONK That's not possible. DREW What do you mean, sir? \nADMISSIONS MONK The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is no foreigners. \nDREW I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk. ADMISSIONS MONK What people want and what they can have are often not the same. DREW Not in this case. MONK Oh, yes, especially in this case. DREW \nI'm not leaving. \nDrew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is going to hold his breath until he turns blue. \nMONK \nYou give me no choice. \n(to other monks) \n", "test1_true": "He continues in a stream of Chinese, and the other monks grab Drew and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the door. \nDREW \nI just want to be a monk! \nDrew is forced through the courtyard to the front door. \nThey pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. He watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through it, out of the temple. He smiles. \nCUT TO: EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW LANDING ON THE FLAGSTONES OF THE COURTYARD WITH A THUMP! \nA group of people stop and watch the foreigner. The temple door closes with a solid boom. \nDREW Hey! What about my... \nThe temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack. It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear, and some socks. The people standing around laugh. Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops and stands ringing the courtyard. He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man is sitting down sipping his tea. The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on, when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall. ASHEMA \nDrew? \nDREW \nHi. \nDrew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him. \nAshema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising from it. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nMake it a double. Rough day. \nASHEMA \nWhat happened? \nDREW \nThey kicked me out... DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TEMPLE STAND \u00ad EVENING ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, ASHEMA AND OLD MAN, STILL SITTING AT THE TABLE, NOW LIT BY CANDLES AND A LANTERN. A bunch of tea bowls are scattered in front of Drew, as if he's been drinking heavily. He points to his teacup, and Ashema shakes her head. ASHEMA You've had enough. \nDrew's shoulders slump even more. ASHEMA (CONT'D) Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New \nYork. DREW I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk. I'd be even more of a disgrace... The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in Chinese, motioning towards Drew. ASHEMA Not now, Bau Bau. DREW Bau Bau? ASHEMA \nMy nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about the temple. \nThe grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really don't want to listen. \nASHEMA (CONT'D) \nHe is telling a story about a monk who was refused admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be allowed to be a monk. \nDREW \nWhat did he do? \nAshema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese. \nASHEMA \nHe decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until they let him in. \nDREW How long? ASHEMA A long time \u00ad through the worst weather. He just sat there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow. DREW Did they let him in? \nASHEMA No. (beat) Of course they did \u00ad what kind of story do you think my \nBau Bau would tell? He stayed in front of the temple until they could no longer say no. He went on to become one of the most famous monks in the history of the temple. Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up and smiles. DREW Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise man. And that he tells a good story. The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head. ASHEMA What are you going to do? Are you going home? Drew shakes his head. \n", "test1_id": 1245, "test2_input": "D.S. Stop! Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring daggers at each other. D.S.

SAN DE CHAMBER \u00ad SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, GAO AND SAN DE IN THE SHADOWS OF SAN DE'S ROOM. \nSan De is sitting down reading a Buddhist text. With a sigh, he puts it down. On the wall behind is hanging a Golden Sash. \nSAN DE \nSo soon? \n(beat) \nTell me what happened. \nDrew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks. \nDREW \nIt was my fault. I started it. \nANGLE ON GAO \nSurprised at Drew's confession. \nDREW (CONT'D) Disciple Gao was better than me. Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation. DREW (CONT'D) I lost my temper. He was only defending himself. \nANGLE ON SAN DE Who nods his head and looks at Drew. SAN DE \nIs this true, Disciple Gao? Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him, nodding for him to say yes. \nGAO Yes. But, I am not completely blameless... SAN DE I didn't think you were... (beat) The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best \u00ad we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger. (beat) Shake hands and let your emotions go. \nGao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept away in the shock of Drew taking the blame. \nThey shake hands. \nBoth Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is occupying a place of honor. \nSAN DE (CONT'D) \nThat is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple. It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle of understanding. \nDREW \nThe best fighter? \nSAN DE \nAmong other things. Fighting is only a small part of being a Shaolin monk. GAO \nYours? San De nods. SAN DE \nReturn to your training. Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door. They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door. \nFinally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao. DREW \nTen more seconds and I would have kicked your ass... Gao smiles and walks through the door. Just as he passes Drew, he punches him in the stomach. GAO In your dreams... INT.

Drew, instead of wearing his temple-issue hat, pulls on a New York Yankees baseball cap! DREW Now, we're ready! \nHe leads them towards the window of their dorm, but stops when he gets there. He turns to where Gao is standing, all alone. \nDREW (CONT'D) \nGao, you coming or what? \nThere is a moment of indecision, then Gao frowns, shakes his head and comes jogging towards them. \nGAO \nI'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble! \nEXT.

They    are about halfway across from the front door of the temple    when a    monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and bobbing    \u00ad he    looks drunk. \nDrew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple? They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and Gao are standing, but he walks on. \nGAO \n(whisper) Drunken Kung Fu... Drew nods and leads them out of the temple. EXT.

The guys, still happy, arrive at the school, and the realization of what they are about to do sinks in. \nThey stop talking and are staring at the building. Drew starts toward the door, and nobody follows his lead. He stops and motions for them to join him. Nobody moves. \nDREW \nAre we men or are we sheep? \nA beat, then the entire group bellows: \nGROUP \nSHEEP! \nAnd they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making noises like sheep. \nINT. PARTY ROOM \u00ad SAME NIGHT \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARTY. \nIt isn't happening. The boys are on one side, the girls are on the other.

The disciples are all clustered together, staring at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing around Drew and Ashema. A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room, observing everything that's going on. ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA DREW Great party... \nAshema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a cassette tape, gives it to Ashema \nDREW (CONT'D) Play this when I signal, OK? She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls DREW (CONT'D) Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of China... He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls. DREW (CONT'D) This is Gao. And this wild man is Li... Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment.

The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard. \nDrew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on. \nDREW (CONT'D) What can I do for you? TOUGH \nLeave. ANGLE ON DISCIPLES. They have noticed what is going on. ANGLE ON DREW DREW No, thanks. He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of him. \nDrew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight. \nDREW (CONT'D) \n", "test2_id": 1246, "test3_input": "Allright!

He is getting the hang of it. \nThe D.S. walks up with another monk with    a spear. Together, they position a wooden target. The monk bows    to D.S. and to the rest of the disciples, then positions the point    of the spear in the hollow of his neck. He then hands the shaft of the    spear to the D.S. \nThe D.S. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear, slowly but surely. \nANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES Amazed. \nANGLE ON THE MONK The spear is now almost bent double.

The football spins into the hands of Gao, who drops it. Drew runs over, showing Gao how to catch the ball, and how to make the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over). Gao follows Drew's instructions, then they run the play. This time Gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown. Drew runs up and high-fives Gao, then teaches him how to spike the ball. They are playing some more, having a great time. This time Drew goes out for a pass, with Gao playing defense.

Drew pauses for a moment, not sure    what San De said, until San De motions with his left hand, like a    NFL quarterback, for Drew to go out. He takes off sprinting, with    Gao covering him like a blanket. San De throws the ball to him in a    perfect spiral, to a spot where Gao has no play on the throw, and    Drew catches it in stride.

After all the trouble you got into... \n", "test3_true": "Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that kind of thing... \nDrew smiles slightly. \nDREW \nI left that girl at the stream.

Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the \nground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on him. A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles this situation. The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch, hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up. They soon tire of the sport and move on, the crowd staring at Drew in pity. DREW (CONT'D) (to himself) This humble, not fighting stuff is harder, and more painful, than it looks! \nANGLE ON THE THUGS \n", "test3_id": 1247}

INT. FIRST FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY 
A working-class funeral in progress. THIRTY PEOPLE and an inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall. 
ANGLE 
A MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands. 
ANGLE 
These Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor. 
ANGLE 
The WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First Man (the recipient of the money) speaks: 
FUNERAL DIRECTOR Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney. 
GALVIN It's a shame about your husband, Mrs. Dee. 
The Widow nods. 
GALVIN I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. He was a wonderful man. (shakes head in sympathy) It was a crime what happened to him. A crime. If there's anything that I could do to help... 
GALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., "Take it. Really. I want you to have it..." She takes the card. 
Beat. 
GALVIN (thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time) Well... 
He shakes her hand and moves on. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Galvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat. 
Reading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, drinks. Lowers it to the table. 
ANGLE - INSERT 
Galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table. 
He moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section. 
We SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral listing. 
ANGLE 
Galvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips. Looks around deserted coffee shop. Sighs. 
INT. SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON 
Galvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE entering, Galvin enters the home. 
ANGLE 
Galvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself between Galvin and the widow. 
SON (of the card) What is that...? 
GALVIN I... 
SON What the hell is that... 
GALVIN ...I was a friend of your fa... 
SON You never knew my father. (hits card out of Galvin's hand) You get out of here, who the hell do you think you are... 
The FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts extricating Galvin from the commotion. 
GALVIN (to Funeral Manager) I'm talking to this man...

HUNSECKER Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear. 
STEVE Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak? 
HUNSECKER May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do? 
STEVE (strongly) I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak! 
HUNSECKER Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt! 
SUSAN 
Suddenly Susan lets loose, with restrained nervous energy; she is near to tears. 
SUSAN Steve, if only for my sake, I want this stopped!  And the same goes for you, too, J.J.! 
HUNSECKER 
He interjects. 
HUNSECKER (contritely) Susie, I'm sorry if--- 
RESUME SUSAN 
SUSAN (bitterly) Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!... 
Restraining tears, she runs up the steps to the stage. 
STEVE, HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY 
Steve looks after her.  Sidney watches intently.  Hunsecker's smile is frostily taunting: 
HUNSECKER You see, Dallas, a plague on both our houses... (then) We may have to call this game on account of darkness... 
Steve turns a blank-eyed stare at him.  Tension gone, a slow mumbling fatigue has set in.  Hunsecker plays it light: 
HUNSECKER If looks could kill, I'm dead... 
STEVE (slowly) No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her... 
HUNSECKER (smiling) And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly. 
STEVE (stung) Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace! 
HUNSECKER (blandly) Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day... 
He turns and stares away, but Steve stops him with--- 
STEVE But my day with Susie isn't over yet and-- 
HUNSECKER (cold) Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell! 
STAGE 
Hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium, Sidney following closely behind.  In background, beyond, Steve and D'Angelo are walking up the aisle to the exit.  CAMERA TRACKS CLOSE on Sidney and Hunsecker.  Hunsecker's face is rigid.  Sidney, close at his elbow, whispers: 
SIDNEY (softly) You did it, J.J., you did it good... 
Sidney is full of confidence.  But Hunsecker barely hears him (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boy's attack; in particular, by the appalling fear that what Steve has said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly believe.) 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Susan is still standing in the wings.  Mary is with her, obviously sympathetic.  The girl is drying her eyes with Kleenex, and Mary glances at her employer with a look of reproach.  Hunsecker walks round the table, obviously trying to approach Susan; seeing this, Susan turns away and moves further from him.  Hunsecker stops. 
HUNSECKER 
There is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the girl.  More gently, he moves forward past CAMERA... 
SUSAN 
Sensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her, she moves away again; she is still crying, but is trying to recover. Presently Hunsecker approaches her again.  He speaks very gently, soothingly, comforting... 
HUNSECKER (softly) You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks? 
SUSAN (a small voice) No.  I'm going home. 
Hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her. 
HUNSECKER Want Sidney to drive you over? 
Ignoring the shake of her head, he calls to Sidney. 
HUNSECKER Drive Susie home. 
HUNSECKER 
Again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl. His eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney stands watching.  He moves gently forward and then speaks in a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her reassurance: 
HUNSECKER Susie...I...I'd have to take it very much amiss if you ever saw that boy again. 
SUSAN 
After a pause, she turns towards him; she looks him straight in the face. 
SUSAN (levelly) I'll never see him again. 
RESUME HUNSECKER 
He seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her. Now he touches her.  His need for her is apparent; he tries to reach her, tries to find an excuse to embrace her.  She submits to this very passively. 
SUSAN 
A VERY CLOSE SHOT.  We see the effort with which she is controlling herself. 
RESUME TWO SHOT 
Satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister, Hunsecker lets her go.  Susan moves away, still avoiding his eyes.  Then she goes off towards the steps down into the auditorium.  Sidney looks at Hunsecker, then after Susan and follows her. 
RESUME HUNSECKER 
He goes back to Mary and the script.  He instructs her: 
HUNSECKER Call Van Cleve.  Tell him he was right.  Tell him I said the Dallas boys are not worthy of his club. 
Poring over the typewritten pages, he senses Mary's eyes on him.  He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice: 
HUNSECKER (without looking up) Mary...for Susie's own good...don't give her misplaced sympathy... 
Mary says nothing.  Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a visible effort to resume his public personality turns towards the machinery of the television broadcast in background.

She smiles sadly. 
LUCILLA There was a time when you didn't call me "Highness." 
MAXIMUS And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea.  All that was a different life. 
LUCILLA (quietly) Very different... I wonder if it was better? 
MAXIMUS It was more honest. 
A moment between them.  We sense there is much to be said, much that could be said. 
Finally: 
MAXIMUS I thank you for your prayers. 
He goes.  She watches him walk away. 
INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT 
Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  He faces six small figures that represent his dead ancestors. 
MAXIMUS Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance.  Bring me your solace and your wisdom.  Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword.  Keep them safe until my return.  Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air.  Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. 
He looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows out the candles around them. 
INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT 
Commodus' eyes are red with weeping.  He sits, head down, at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father. 
COMMODUS (quietly) I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you... to make you proud... and I can never do it.  One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years... What is it in me you hate so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My hands are your hands.  All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar.  Father. 
He stands.  We see that he is holding the scroll denoting Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the Senate.  Commodus cannot control his tears. 
COMMODUS Why does Maximus deserve what I could never have? -- Why do you love his eyes over mine? -- I would butcher the whole world -- if you would only love me... 
Commodus weeps. 
INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT 
Quintus is waking Maximus -- 
QUINTUS General -- Maximus -- 
MAXIMUS Quintus -- ? 
QUINTUS The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent. 
Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with Quintus... 
EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT 
Dead of night.  Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent. 
MAXIMUS What is it?  Is he ill? 
QUINTUS I don't know... 
They continue on toward Marcus' tent. 
INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT 
Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams to a halt.  Stunned. 
Commodus stands before him.  Lucilla stands in a corner of the tent, head down. 
And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed. 
Maximus stares at Marcus. 
COMMODUS Lament with me, brother, our great father is dead.  I want -- 
Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus. 
He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  A ritual farewell. 
A moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.  He turns very, very slowly to Commodus. 
COMMODUS General, the Gods' have taken the great man and left me alone.  My first desire as Emperor is that you take my hand in friendship.  I need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above all others.  Stand with me. 
Maximus glares at him: 
MAXIMUS How did he die? 
Commodus does not respond.

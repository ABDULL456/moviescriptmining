EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
WIth an awesome force, the DRILLING HOLE BLOWS. The DRILLING PIPE EXPLODES  upward, lifting the DRILLING ARM and the ENTIRE ARMADILLO VEHICLE with it. THE  ENTIRE RIG blows upward into space. 
INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 
Max punches the DOOR LOCK without depressurising the cabin and is sucked  violently out of the rear compartment into open space. 
EXT. SPACE OVER ASTEROID SURFACE 
FIFTY FEET OF DRILL PIPE, THE DRILLING ARM, and the entire ARMADILLO RIG with  MAX trailing, BLOWS into space. MAX'S FACE is a screaming mask of terror and  confusion, reaching out, but there's no one to catch him....Harry and the guys  watch in helpless silence as the drill rig and Max ascend into space. 
Chick Max.....No. No. No. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Skip motions to Golden. He comes over. 
Skip They just lost the rig. The hole blew out. 
Golden takes the news stoically. He thinks, looking across the room at Temple.  He looks at the clock. ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES TO GO. 
Golden Say nothing. 
EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 
Silence. A stark tableau. Harry and the men standing there, just watching.  Devastated, confused, in shock. This is a total catastrophe. The mission is  over. 
Sharp nods to Pitts. Pitts picks up the REMOTE NUCLEAR DETONATOR. 
Sharp Stamper, you ready to blow this? Let's get outta here...! 
Harry ignores him. He won't accept defeat. 
Harry Chick, get your butt over here. 
Chick drags his ass over to Harry. 
Chick Yeah. 
Harry We're gonna fix this - make it work. If we weld those two together and  go in one speed.... 
Chick Harry.... 
Harry Get your ass up here! 
Chick doesn't move. The two men stare at each other. 
Chick I've been with you fourteen years. I've never said this to you, never  thought I would. It's over. 
Chick walks off toward the shuttle. Bear joins him. 
Harry, atop of the Armadillo, looks around. His head drops...he's burning up.  His fist clenches the HALF MEDALLION in his hand (where is it - clipped to suit  - in pouch of suit?) His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from  defeat. He will not give up. 
CAMERA'S at low angle, giving Harry a larger-than-life look. 
Harry hears something. A LOW RUMBLE. It is confusing. It sounds like......an  ARMADILLO ENGINE. 
Harry opens his eyes. He slowly turns and looks -- 
ACROSS THE VALLEY - ON THE DISTANT RIDGE - The front bumper of A.J.'s Armadillo  inches over the ridge crest. 
HARRY, for the first time on the asteroid, smiles. Miracles do happen. 
HARRY CHICK...BEAR!!! 
Chick and Bear about ready to enter the Freedom's airlock, stop and turn. They  see A.J.'S ARMADILLO ROARING down the hillside onto the drilling site. 
EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 
A.J. and Lev roar up to the drilling site in the Independence's Armadillo. They  come down a hill spectacularly without brakes and it piles into shit, knocking  things down. 
Lev and A.J. bounce up to Chick and Bear.....hugs and high-fives go around. 
Bear A.J. Frost. Back from the dead. 
Chick Now you can die with us. 
Harry All the bits are gone, A.J. I've been inventing drill bits for  twenty-five years and I don't know what to use. 
A.J. You wouldn't happen to need a diamond tipper, would you? 
A.J. pulls out the POUCH OF DIAMONDS, found on the ridge. 
Harry Boys, we're back in business! 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
Golden stares at the wall. Grace is curled up on a chair in the corner. 
Harry (V.O.) We have good news folks. A.J. and the Russian just showed up. No other survivors. 
Grace shuts her eyes, smiling. Sobbing. 
EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AFTERNOON 
Chick shuts off an ARC WELDER and moves aside, letting Harry view a DRILL BIT  with A.J.'S DIAMONDS mounted on the top like diamonds in a ring setting. Harry  and the guys smile.

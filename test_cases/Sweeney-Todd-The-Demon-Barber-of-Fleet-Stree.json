It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to see... \nJOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars, humming to herself as she does needlepoint. \nAnthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized. \nJohanna notices a Bird Seller passing.

DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1 \nForeboding organ music is heard... \nWe are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory? ... we're not sure... \nThe flickering glow of flame is the only illumination... \nThe ominous organ music continues as... \nFrom the bottom of the frame... \nA dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected in the blood... \nFinally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. \nSUDDENLY-- \nA shrill factory whistle blows-- \nENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering -- the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring inferno; a human scream-- \nAnd a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool of blood. \nHe is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat. \nThe camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right side up as-- \nGENTLEMAN Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. \nWe cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before us. Strangely impassive. \nWe are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a world of silhouettes and shadows. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 2. 1   CONTINUED:                                                     1 \nAnother figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund and sleek. Impressive muttonchops. \nBANKER He kept a shop in London town, Of fancy clients and good renown, And what if none of their souls were saved? They went to their maker impeccably shaved... \nMore FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the Gentleman and the Banker as... \nBANKER By Sweeney, By Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. \nAlthough prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact, GHOSTS. \nGHOSTS Swing your razor wide, Sweeney! Hold it to the skies! Freely flows the blood of those Who moralize! \nAs they continue, the new figures become more distinct... \nTHE GENERAL, a tough, leather-skinned military man in a crimson imperial uniform... \nGENERAL His needs were few, his room was bare: \nTHE PRIEST, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical attire... \nPRIEST A lavabo and a fancy chair... \nTHE TOURIST, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting suit... \nTOURIST A mug of suds and a leather strop, An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop... \nTHE STUDENT, a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious long hair... \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 3. 1   CONTINUED: (2)                                               1 \nSTUDENT For neatness he deserves a nod, Does Sweeney Todd... \nGENTLEMAN The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. \n4   EXT. FLOWER MARKET -- FLASHBACK -- DAY                         4 \n...Fifteen years before. \nTodd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA. \nTodd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling. Chatting with his wife. Happy. \nTODD (V.O.) There was another man who saw That she was beautiful, A pious vulture of the law, Who with a gesture of his claw Removed the barber from his plate. Then there was nothing but to wait And she would fall, So soft, So young, So lost, And oh, so beautiful! \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 7. 4   CONTINUED:                                                    4 \nDuring the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her. \nWith the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered face never quite disguising his lethality. \nThe Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator. \nAnd we return to... \n5   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             5 \nMusic continues. \nANTHONY And the lady, sir ... did she succumb? \nTODD Oh, that was many years ago... I doubt if anyone would know. \nA quiet beat. \nTODD I owe you my life, Anthony. If you hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on the ocean still ... Thank you. \nTodd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go. \nANTHONY Will I see you again? TODD You might find me, if you like, around Fleet Street. \nANTHONY Until then, my friend. \nHe offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes. \nThen Todd quickly turns and goes. \nAnthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall that hangs over his friend. PAGE 8. \n6   EXT. STREET -- MORNING                                         6 \nTodd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter: \nTODD There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And it's filled with people Who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it... \nHe disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS-- \n7   EXT. LONDON ASSAULT -- DAY                                     7 \n--We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards -- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending us hurtling to-- \n8   EXT. THE PIE SHOP -- DAY                                       8 \nFleet Street. \nWe see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to it. Imposing and dead at the same time. \nThere is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened second floor room with a window overlooking the street. \nThe music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in front of the shop, considering it deeply. The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and then gone. \nTodd finally strides to the shop and enters... \n9   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           9 \nBehind the dusty counter is... \nMRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her 40's. \nShe is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her face. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 9. 9   CONTINUED:                                                    9 \nThe moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds -- her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of prey: \nMRS. LOVETT A customer! \nTodd is startled, starts to go-- \nMRS. LOVETT Wait! What's yer rush? What's yer hurry? (She sticks the knife into the counter) You gave me such a-- (Wipes her hands on her apron) ) Fright. I thought you was a ghost. Half a minute, can'tcher? Sit! Sit ye down! (An order) Sit! (He obeys) All I meant is that I Haven't seen a customer for weeks. Did you come here for a pie, sir? (Todd nods. She flicks a bit of dust off a pie with a rag) Do forgive me if me head's a little vague-- Ugh! (She plucks something off the pie, examines it) What is that? But you'd think we had the plague-- (She drops it on the floor and stamps on it) From the way that people-- (She flicks something off the pie with her finger) Keep avoiding-- (Spotting it moving) No, you don't! (She smacks it with her hand) Heaven knows I try, sir! (Lifts her hand, looks at it) Tsk! (She wipes it on the edge of the counter) But there's no one comes in even to inhale-- \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 10. 9   CONTINUED: (2)                                                9 \nThe Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom. She is shocked to see a fancy-dress ball in progress. \nMasked couples swirl around the ballroom, their number sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame the room. The hanging chandeliers, draped in red cloth, cast a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings... \nMRS. LOVETT (V.O.) Of course, when she goes there, Poor thing, poor thing, They're having this ball all in masks. \nLucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers, they buffet her, confusing her... \nMRS. LOVETT (V.O.) There's no one she knows there, Poor dear, poor thing, She wanders tormented, and drinks, Poor thing. The Judge has repented, she thinks, Poor thing. \"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?\" she asks. \nThe Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm, leading her through the party. She is thankful for the salvation he provides. He brings her to Judge Turpin. \nThe Judge descends on Lucy, raping her. The other guests crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. A feverish nightmare. \nMRS. LOVETT (V.O.) He was there, all right-- Only not so contrite! She wasn't no match for such craft, you see, \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 15. 13   CONTINUED:                                                     13 \nAnd everyone thought it so droll. They figured she had to be daft, you see, So all of `em stood there and laughed, you see, Poor soul! Poor thing! \nTODD (V.O.) NOOOOOOOO...! \nTodd's wild howl shatters the memory and tears us back to-- \n14   INT. PARLOR -- DAY                                             14 \n--Todd is bolting up from the sofa, tormented-- \nTODD ..... NOOOOOO! \nHe stands for a terrible beat. \nTODD Would no one have mercy on her? \nMRS. LOVETT So it is you -- Benjamin Barker. \nTODD Where's Lucy?! Where's my wife?! \nMRS. LOVETT She poisoned herself. Arsenic from the apothecary on the corner. I tried to stop her but she wouldn't listen to me. And he's got your daughter. \nTODD He? Judge Turpin? \nMRS. LOVETT Adopted her like his own. \nTodd absorbs this sickening news. \nTODD Fifteen years of sweating in a living hell on a false charge. Fifteen years dreaming that I might come home to find a loving wife and child... \nA beat as he stares into the fire, madness and purpose creeping in. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 16. 14   CONTINUED:                                                    14 \nMRS. LOVETT Well, I can't say the years have been particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker, but you still-- \nTODD No, not Barker. That man is dead. It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd ... And he will have his revenge. \nHe continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares with unblinking eyes into the fire: \nTODD Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay for what they did. \nA beat. He finally turns to her. \nTODD First I must have my shop back. \n15   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           15 \nThey emerge from the pie shop. She begins to scale the exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. He hesitates. \nMRS. LOVETT Come along... \nShe continues up, he slowly follows. \n16   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                        16 \nA macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs. Furniture covered in sheets. A broken mirror on one wall. \nWe hear footsteps approaching and then Mrs. Lovett enters. The door creaks like a living thing. \nMRS. LOVETT Not to worry, a touch of oil will put that right. (she turns back to Todd) ... Nothing to be afraid of, love, come in. \nShe moves into the room. But Todd hesitates at the door, looking into the room. \nFor him this is a truly haunted place. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 17. 16   CONTINUED:                                                   16 \nMeanwhile, she kneels and pries loose a floorboard. \nShe continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of her words seem intended only for him... \nJOHANNA My cage has many rooms, Damask and dark. Nothing there sings, Not even my lark. Larks never will, you know, When they're captive. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 21. 17   CONTINUED:                                                     17 \nTeach me to be more adaptive. \nGreen finch and linnet bird, Nightingale, blackbird, Teach me how to sing. If I cannot fly, Let me sing. \nThen she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her room. She looks terrified. \nBelow, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from the window. \nHe is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring: \nBEGGAR WOMAN Alms! ... Alms! ... For a miserable woman On a miserable chilly morning... (Anthony drops a coin into her hand) Thank yer, sir, thank yer. \nANTHONY Ma'am, could tell me whose house this is? \nBEGGAR WOMAN That's the great Judge Turpin's house that is. \nANTHONY And the young lady who resides there? BEGGAR WOMAN That's Johanna, his pretty little ward. Keeps her snug, he does, all locked up ... So don't you go trespassing there or it's a good whipping for you -- or any other young man with mischief on his mind... \nShe suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault: \nBEGGAR WOMAN 'Ow would you like a little muff, dear, A little jig jig A little bounce around the bush? Wouldn't you like to push me parsley? \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 22. 17   CONTINUED: (2)                                               17 \nIt looks to me, dear, Like you got plenty there to push. \nShe grabs at Anthony's crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other pedestrians as she goes: \nBEGGAR WOMAN Alms! ... Alms!... For a desperate woman... \nAnthony considers the mansion. He sees a figure standing at a window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him. \nHe sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly: \nANTHONY I feel you, Johanna, I feel you. I was half convinced I'd waken, Satisfied enough to dream you. Happily I was mistaken, Johanna! I'll steal you, Johanna, I'll steal you... \nThen the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open... \nAnthony is expecting Johanna... \nBut it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's flashback, who steps into the doorway. \nHe seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles and beckons to Anthony. \nAnthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the warm smile. \nJUDGE Come in, lad. Come in... \nAnthony goes into the mansion. \n18   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- LIBRARY -- DAY                       18 \nJudge Turpin leads Anthony into the dark library, filled with books. Anthony is looking around for Johanna. He is wary, this is all very strange. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 23. 18   CONTINUED:                                                    18 \nJUDGE ... you were looking for Hyde Park, you say? \nANTHONY Yes, it's terribly large on the map but I keep getting lost... \nJUDGE Sit down, lad, sit down. \nAnthony sits, uncomfortable, as the Judge pours two snifters of brandy. \nANTHONY It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings, but, well, there you are. \nThen... \nThe large form of the Beadle appears from the shadows. No introduction is made. Anthony glances to him, uneasy. \nJUDGE A sailor, eh? \nANTHONY Yes, sir. The \"Bountiful\" out of Plymouth. \nJUDGE (handing him a snifter of brandy) A sailor must know the ways of the world, yes? ... Must be practiced in the ways of the world ... Would you say you are practiced, boy? \nANTHONY Sir? \nThe Judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in the richest leather. He runs a finger along the spines of the books; his large library of pornography. \nJUDGE Oh, yes ... such practices ... the geishas of Japan ... the concubines of Siam .. the catamites of Greece ... the harlots of India ... I have them all here ... Drawings of them .... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 27. 22   CONTINUED:                                                   22 \nMRS. LOVETT (seeing the Beadle, pulling his arm) Come along now, dear, he might recognize you-- \nTODD I will do what I have vowed to do ... (he continues to glare at the Beadle, his voice low) ... Come closer, my friend, closer... \nThen, TOBY -- a 13-year-old boy, a bit small for his age, malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirelli's caravan. He bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers. \nA crowd begins to gather at the caravan as: \nTOBY Ladies and gentlemen! May I have your attention, perlease? Do you wake every morning in shame and despair To discover your pillow is covered with hair Wot ought not to be there? Well, ladies and gentlemen, From now on you can waken at ease. You need never again have a worry or care, I will show you a miracle marvelous rare, Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose from the dead! (A woman gasps, he smiles and wiggles a finger no) On the top of my head. \nHe dramatically doffs his cap, revealing mountains of hair which cascade to his shoulder. \nTOBY 'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir, That's wot did the trick, sir, True, sir, true. Was it quick, sir? Did it in a tick, sir? Just like an elixir Ought to do! (To a Bald Man) How about a bottle, mister? Only costs a penny, guaranteed. (Pours a drop on the bald man's head) Does Pirelli's \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 28. 22   CONTINUED: (2)                                               22 \nStimulate the growth, sir? You can have my oath, sir, 'Tis unique. (Applies the bald man's hand to the wet spot) Rub a minute, Stimulatin', i'n it? Soon you'll have to thin it Once a week! \nMore customers are stepping up and buying bottles. \nTodd opens a bottle of the Elixir, takes a whiff. Disgusting. He smiles to Mrs. Lovett, his plan falling into place. \nTODD (loudly, to Mrs. Lovett) Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench? \nMRS. LOVETT Are we standing near an open trench? \nTODD (to a woman in the crowd) Must be standing near an open trench! \nThe crowd responds to Todd and Mrs. Lovett, looking askance and sniffing at the bottles. Toby nervously tries to distract them: \nTOBY Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir: Anything wot's slick, sir, Soon sprouts curls. Try Pirelli's! When they see how thick, sir, You can have your pick, sir, Of the girls! \nWant to buy a bottle, missus? \nTODD (sniffing bottle of Elixir) What is this? \nMRS. LOVETT (sniffing another customer's bottle) What is this? \nTODD Smells like piss. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 29. 22   CONTINUED: (3)                                              22 \nMRS. LOVETT Smells like -- phew! \nTODD This is piss. Piss with ink. \nThe music speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate: \nTOBY Let Pirelli's Activate your roots, sir-- \nTODD Keep it off your boots, sir-- Eats right through. \nTOBY Yes, get Pirelli's! Use a bottle of it! Ladies seem to love it-- \nMRS. LOVETT Flies do too! \nSuddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung wide to reveal-- \nPIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a moment. Then: \nPIRELLI I am Adolfo Pirelli, Da king of da barbers, da barber of kings, E buon giorno, good day, I blow you a kiss! (he does so) And I, da so-famous Pirelli, I wish-a to know-a Who has-a da nerve-a to say My elixir is piss! Who says this?! \nTODD I do. (Todd moves forward boldly.) I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street. I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's elixir, and I say to you that it is nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted from piss and ink. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 30. 22   CONTINUED: (4)                                              22 \nThe crowd gasps. Pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but Todd continues-- \nTODD And furthermore --   \"signor\" -- I have serviced no kings,   yet I wager I can shave a cheek with   ten times more dexterity that any   street mountebank. \nHe snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to see, turning to display the wondrous razors: \nTODD You see these razors? \nMRS. LOVETT (to the crowd) The finest in England. \nTODD (glaring at Pirelli) I lay them against five pounds you are no match for me. You hear me, sir? Either accept my challenge or reveal yourself as a sham. \nMRS. LOVETT Bravo, bravo. \nThe crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the meek TOURIST we saw earlier. \nPirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the crowd with a confident smile: PIRELLI You hear zis foolish man? Watch and see how he will regret his folly! \nMusic begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the challenge: \nPIRELLI (snarling) We're pulling out, yes. Quickly. \nMrs. Lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with Todd, who is making his way inexorably toward the Beadle. \nSome eager customers surround Todd, among them is the TOURIST. \nEAGER CUSTOMER Mr. Todd, sir, do you have an establishment of your own? \nMrs. Lovett is on him like a hawk: \nMRS. LOVETT He certainly does. Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor -- above my meatpie emporium in Fleet Street. \nTodd has led them right to the Beadle: \nTODD I thank you for your honest adjudication, sir. You are a paragon of integrity. \nBEADLE Well, I try to do my best for my friends and neighbors ... Your establishment is in Fleet Street, you say? TODD Yes, sir. \nBEADLE Then, Mr. Todd, you will surely see me there before the week is out. \nTODD You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford, and I guarantee to give you, without a penny's charge, the closest shave you will ever know. PAGE 35. \n23   EXT. STREET -- DAY                                            23 \nTodd and Mrs. Lovett are walking away from the marketplace. She chatters happily: \nMRS. LOVETT ... Like to give me a coronary right there! What if he had recognized you! Lord, my heart was beating a mile a minute, just like a little finch it was. Aren't those lovely birds now? Always so twittery and happy... \nShe continues chattering... \nBut Todd is not listening. \nHis eyes dart to the side to see-- \nThe Gentleman is walking next to him, whispering, subtle, insinuating... \nGENTLEMAN Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned. Like a perfect machine 'e planned... \nThe Banker moves in next to the Gentleman... \nBANKER Barbing the hook, baiting the trap, Setting it out for the Beadle to snap... \nThe General joins them... \nGENERAL Slyly courted 'im, Sweeney did, Set a sort of a scene 'e did... \nGENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL Laying the trail, showing the traces, Letting it lead to higher places... Sweeney... \nThe last word echoes ... And then they are gone ... disappearing from Todd's mind ... swallowed up by the crowd of pedestrians... \nTodd looks to Mrs. Lovett and she continues chattering: \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 36. 23   CONTINUED:                                                23 \nMRS. LOVETT ... Suppose it's just me gentle heart, but I do hate to see a boy treated like that, no better than your Aunt Doreen's dog -- Mr. Todd, are you listening to me? \nTODD Of course. \nBut then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters. He only sees strangers. \n24   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                24 \nJohanna sits, framed by the window, quietly cutting out silhouettes. Aimless Victorian handicrafts. \nBut we see there are tears in her eyes. \nShe steals a glance across the room. We see a small hole in the wallpaper. Through this hole, the Judge is watching her from another chamber. Lascivious. Perverse. \nJohanna finally stands and casually glances out from between the shutters at her window. She sees... \nAnthony, standing at the park across the street, keeping up his lonely vigil, gazing up at the mansion. \nShe watches him for a moment and then makes her decision. She moves to a table and opens a drawer. Reaches in and removes something... \n25   EXT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- MORNING                              25 Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a clinking sound. Metal on pavement. \nHe quickly moves across the street and looks... \nA key, dropped from above. \nHe looks up to the shutters and smiles, then snatches up the key and hurries off. \n26   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                26 \nPeering through the shutters, Johanna watches him go. \nWe linger on her face and then dissolve to another face, also watching... PAGE 37. \nThen he goes to the trunk, leans down to open it, the camera follows him down and up again, when he rises-- The GENTLEMAN is standing right behind him! \nTodd turns. \nThe Gentleman's face is completely impassive. He is not spectral. He does not disappear.

He glares down a wasted wretch of a BOY. The Beadle stands next to the boy. \nJUDGE This is the second time, sir, that you have been brought before this bench. Though it is my earnest wish to ever temper justice with mercy, your persistent dedication to a life of crime is an abomination before God and man. \nHe places a black cloth on his head: \nJUDGE I therefore sentence you to hang by the neck until you are dead and may the Lord have mercy on your soul. \nThe wretched boy collapses in sobs. The Beadle is pleased with the verdict. \nThe Judge removes the black cloth and tosses it casually on his desk: \nJUDGE This court is adjourned. \n36   EXT. -- STREET -- OUTSIDE THE OLD BAILEY -- DAY               36 \nThe Judge and the Beadle walk away from the impressive edifices of the Old Bailey. \nBEADLE Thank you, your Honor.

FOGG'S ASYLUM -- EVENING                              105 \nA cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low ceiling pressing down. \nWe discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker, walking past the cells with the odious MR. FOGG. Fogg carries a large pair of scissors. \nFOGG ... Oh yes, sir, I agree it would be to our mutual interest to come to some arrangement in regard to my poor children's hair. \nHe moves to one of the cells and unlocks it: FOGG I keep the blondes over here. It was yellow hair you was looking for, sir? \nANTHONY Yes. \nFogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates, all blonde women, scurry back, clearly terrified of Fogg. Anthony sees Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral animal, cowering in a corner of the cell. \nANTHONY (points) That one has hair the shade I need. \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 103. 105   CONTINUED:                                                   105 \nFogg goes to fetch Johanna, hauls her to Anthony: \nFOGG Come, child. Smile for the gentleman and you shall have a sweetie. \nJohanna's eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony, but she says nothing. \nFOGG (prepares scissors) Now, where shall I cut? \nBefore Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell. He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in. \nANTHONY Not a word, Mr. Fogg, or it will be your last ... Now, I leave you to the mercy of your \"children.\" \nHe grabs Johanna and pulls her away. \nMr. Fogg turns. He is locked in with the blonde inmates. They slowly begin to advance on him. Menacing. It is likely they are going to rip him limb from limb... \n106   EXT.

About the stink from your chimney. They say at night, it's something most foul. Health regulations -- and the general public welfare, naturally -- being my duty, I'm afraid I'll have to take a look ... (inhales the snuff, Sneezes and daintily wipes his nose) ... at your bakehouse. \nTODD (smoothly) Of course ... But first why don't you come upstairs and let me attend to you? \nBEADLE Much as I do appreciate tonsorial adornment, I really ought see to my \"official\" obligations first. \nTODD An admirable sentiment -- But I must ask you, out of professional curiosity you understand, is that a cream or a tallow pomade? \nBEADLE (touches his hair) Oh, not a pomade at all! Me secret is a touch of ambergris. \nTODD But, sir, hair that delicate requires a genuine pomade! Come along, let me show you the difference. \nTodd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see the TOURIST, the STUDENT, the PRIEST and others. \nThey are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama -- \nGHOSTS (variously) Sweeney!

When we're free of this place all the ghosts will go away. \nShe looks at him very intensely: \nJOHANNA No, Anthony, they never go away. \nHe gently touches her face. \nANTHONY I'll be right back to you ... Half an hour and we'll be free. \nHe goes. \nShe turns to the window, watches him go.

What was that? \nTODD Oh, nothing, sir. Nothing. May we proceed? \nThe music builds as he steps behind the Judge-- his razor ready -- we are sure the great moment has come -- the music still builds -- Todd finally puts the razor at the Judge's throat-- \nThen-- \nWith an easy flick of his wrist, he just begins to shave the Judge, as: \nTODD Pretty women...

Pretty   women, sir! Pretty   women! Pretty   women, sir! \nTODD Pretty women, here's to Pretty women, all the Pretty women-- \nJust as the music reaches a climax, Todd raises his arm in a huge arc and is about to slash the Judge's throat when-- \nSuddenly-- \nAnthony bursts in-- \nANTHONY Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna! She said she'll leave with me tonight--! \nThe Judge jumps up, away from Todd-- \nJUDGE You! -- There is indeed a higher power to warn me thus in time-- \nHe tears off the sheet as he advances savagely on Anthony: \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 58. 38   CONTINUED: (8)                                               38 \nJUDGE Johanna elope with you?

Still she holds her ground. \nJUDGE Until this moment I have spared the rod ... And the ungrateful child has broken my heart.

TURPIN'S MANSION -- EVENING                               50 \nAnthony is racing toward the front of mansion when he sees-- \nA hansom cab is just pulling away -- Johanna's terrified face looking at him through the window-- \nANTHONY JOHANNA! \nAnthony sees the Beadle pulling her away from the window as the carriage clatters off-- \nJudge Turpin stands on the steps of the mansion -- Anthony goes to him in a murderous rage: \nANTHONY Where are you taking her?! Tell me or I swear by God--! \nThe Judge spins and roars -- a hellish howl that echoes-- JUDGE WOULD YOU KILL ME, BOY?! HERE I STAND! \nAnthony's eyes burn into the Judge -- but he is no killer. \nHe turns and races after the hansom cab. It rounds a corner and is gone. \nThe Judge watches as Anthony pursues the cab, disappearing around the corner. \nAnd we fade to... \n51   EXT.

A few pedestrians move quickly down the sidewalk past her, excited. They chatter back and forth eagerly... \nThe Beggar Woman uncoils and follows... \nAnd we finally see what the Beggar Woman has been watching so intently... \n52   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          52 \nMrs. Lovett's wretched establishment has been transformed! \nShe has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables, surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns. A fresh coat of paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the feeling of upward mobility. \nA new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop: \"MRS. LOVETT'S WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES!\" And then in smaller letters: \"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE.\" \nThe eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about. \nAll eating, eating, eating... \n...The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever imagine. Crispy crust. Thick, luxurious gravy. Tart and tangy meat. \nThe customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming gravy oozing down greedy faces. Chomp. Chomp. Chomp. \nThe Beggar Women stands across the street, ravenously hungry. She finally gets the nerve to approach when-- \nToby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from the shop and circulates through the customers: \nTOBY Ladies and gentlemen, May I have your attention, perlease? Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell? Yes they are, I can tell... \n(CONTINUED) PAGE 73. 52   CONTINUED:                                                      52 \nHe moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor garden and toward the street as: \nTOBY Well, ladies and gentlemen, That aroma enriching the breeze Is like nothing compared to its succulent source, As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course. \n", "test3_true": "TOBY Ladies and gentlemen, You can't imagine the rapture in store-- (Indicating the pie shop) Just inside of this door! There you'll sample Mrs. Lovett's meat pies, Savory and sweet pies, As you'll see. You who eat pies, Mrs. Lovett's meat pies Conjure up the treat pies Used to be! \nJust then Mrs. Lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of hot, steaming pies. \nLike her shop, she has been transformed as well. She wears her somewhat gauche notion of a \"fancy dress.\" Buckets of decolletage. And her hair has been dyed a rather unique aubergine color. \nMRS. LOVETT Toby! TOBY Coming!

LOVETT Nice to see you, dearie... How have you been keeping?... Cor, me bones is weary! Toby--! (Indicating a Customer) One for the gentleman...

No, we don't cut slices... Cor, me eyes are bleary!... (As Toby is about to pour for a drunken customer) Toby! None for the gentleman!... I could up me prices-- I'm a little leery...

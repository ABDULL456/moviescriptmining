DOMINO I was on the phone, talking to a friend that knows what's going on. 
MARIACHI Did you mention me? 
DOMINO No... He told me the man in black is Azul. 
MARIACHI If his name is Azul, why doesn't he wear blue? 
DOMINO I don't know... Anyway, he's killing the men of the town drug dealer. The dealer's name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco. 
MARIACHI And Moco is sending these men to find Azul. So, why do they chase me? 
DOMINO They have never seen Azul... only Moco knows him. My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds like you, no? 
MARIACHI Couldn't you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town? One is a killer, and one is a mariachi. 
DOMINO Only special people can talk to Moco. Besides, you've killed a few of his men, now. Your best option is to keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is all over. 
EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY 
Mean Dude #5 comes in and approaches Moco. 
MEAN DUDE #5 He got away... but I got a good look at him. 
Moco takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Coca, Caca, Beto were killed. 
Moco takes out a match. 
MEAN DUDE #5 He won't get away again, Moco. I promise. 
Moco lights his match across Mean Dude #5's face and lights his cigarette. Mean Dude #5 walks away, as Moco flicks his match at him in slow motion. 
INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - NIGHT 
Mariachi is about to lay on the floor. She tosses him a blanket. 
MARIACHI Are you always closed Monday nights, or did you close since I can't play my guitar tonight?

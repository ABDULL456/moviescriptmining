He lays them on the corner of the stand... then slips into the chair. He picks the cards up and flips thru them. On the back we can see scribbled... "NED'S IDIOT CARDS" 
NED Yeah. These are them. 
Ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the cards. 
NED Reading from the cards now... quote "You have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say... may be used against you in a court of law." Is that right? 
NED (back in the chair) That's right. 
NED (stands up, announces) WRONG! The official Miranda warning is... "anything you say CAN be used against you in a court of law." Not "may"... "CAN!" (on the attack) Don't you know the difference between "can" and "may", Detective? Every school kid knows "can" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while "may" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act. 
Ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he hits the chair. 
NED I didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns! I was trying to protect society from a deranged MADMAN! (leaps up, pointing) But this ivy league fop...!!! 
The courtroom ERUPTS! The Judge bangs the gavel. Ned strides proudly toward the defense table. 
NED I have no more use for this witness. 
JUDGE ALLEN Mr. Ravine... 
Ned turns. The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach the bench. Ned does, resting his hand on it. 
JUDGE ALLEN I'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar. 
The Judge smacks Ned's hand with a ruler! 
NED Ow! 
PROSECUTOR (jumps up) But your Honor...! 
JUDGE ALLEN I know, I know. It's a technicality. But it's the kind of technicality that makes the American legal system what it is today! Court's adjourned! 
The Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it on the bench like a gavel. BAM! BAM! BAM! It is DEAFENING! Everyone covers their ears in pain. 
The THX Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the screen... along with "The Courtroom Is Listening" 
INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Ned turns the key... enters through the private door. He HEARS the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's Theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the outer office. 
ANGLE - NED'S POV THRU OPENING 
A gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high-heeled shoes. 
There are several CANDY WRAPPERS, CIGARETTE BUTTS and other pieces of TRASH stuck to the bottom of one shoe. 
NED 
pushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips up slowly, revealing her eyes. 
LOLA I waited. You never came back. 
Ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel. 
NED I got busy. Here's that paper towel I promised. 
LOLA Thanks... 
NED How'd you get in? The door was locked. 
Lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. She smiles. 
LOLA It's miraculous what a real woman can do... with a bobbie pin. 
Ned looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She pulls out a pack of cigarettes... BLACK LUNG LITES. 
LOLA (offering) Cigarette? 
NED No... thanks. They're bad for ya. 
He goes to the water cooler. She lights up, exhaling a soft cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring. 
LOLA Yes, I know. I like things that are bad for me. (touching lawbooks) So... I hear you go both ways. 
Ned hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup. 
NED Only once. It was a fraternity prank. I never saw him again. 
He gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand. 
LOLA No, I mean... you're a cop and a lawyer. 
NED Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets... but they all deserve a fair and costly trial. 
Ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the waste basket. He misses. 
Laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. She sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to pick it up. 
LAURA I'll get that. 
She picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket.

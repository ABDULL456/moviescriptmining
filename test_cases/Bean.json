{"train": "DR. BEAN \nBy \nRichard Curtis \nAnd \nRobin Driscoll \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARDROOM - DAY \nA very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the walls. \nA group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. They are the trustees of the National Gallery. LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To his right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON fidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to speak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to fidgeting. So does everyone else. \nCUT TO: \nCREDIT.   POLYGRAM & WORKING TITLE PRESENT. CUT TO: \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARD ROOM - DAY \nThe scene is as silent and static as we left it Last... then: \nGARETH I suppose we could just sack him. CUT TO: \nEXT.   MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY \nMr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world- \nHe walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes. The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending their car. \nBEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside, fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening speed with a smug look     on his face. \nThe Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits. \nBEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound fault. \nBEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps violently. \nBEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune. \nOn he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful traffic. \nHeels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight- line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S \nsatisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls. \nBut at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's outside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door. BEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store. \nINT.    HARRODS.   DAY. \nBEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and leather glove racks. \nCUT TO a Security Guard. As       he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car just shoots behind him. The       Guard continues through the Children's section there are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the Lime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past. \nThe moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps. \nCUT TO: \n6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see what it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street. \nEXT.    KNIGHTSBRIDGE.     DAY. \nOut in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned. \nCUT TO: EXT.    THE STRAND.     DAY. \nAn Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off, and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery and the mini. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.    NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY \nBEAN    gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and takes    out a \"Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the back    window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re- locks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work. \nAs he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that Board meeting was taking place. \nCUT TO: INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARDROOM - DAY \nGARETH Look, I don't hate the man but ... \nHe has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is on the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream. \nHe then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger holes. \nAfter a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall. \nHe then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!, \nSUIT MAN What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art stored in that one, curious brain of yours. \nBEAN beams. \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.   BOARDROOM - DAY \nGARETH Then we are agreed, gentlemen.   He goes. \nVINCENT Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete. \nHUBERT There's no question. \nLORD WALTON Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking the pills. \nA reserved smatter of laughter, from relief more than anything.      LORD W. talks into an intercom on the table. \nLORD WALTON Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom, please. \nMISS HUTCHINSON (V/O ) \nYes sir. oh, and Lord Walton, the Grierson Gallery called again. \nLORD WALTON Thank you. (To the room) One final thing. Once again we have been invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly modest collection - but it does include the most famous American painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts? \nCut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not very interested. A 106 year old SIR RUPERT puts up his hand. \nLORD WALTON Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge. Your invaluable thoughts, sir? \nSIR RUPERT Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question. \nCUT TO: \nINT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      STORAGE OFFICE - DAY \nBack in his office area BEAN ceremoniously hands SUIT MAN the Van Hocht painting. He's very proud of himself. \nSUIT MAN Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius. \nBEAN laughs - delighted.         SUIT MAN exits and MISS HUTCHINSON enters, warily. \nMISS HUTCHINSON Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom. \nBEAN gives a little pleasured squeak.             How exciting for him.   He follows MISS HUTCHINSON out into the corridor. \nCUT TO: INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      CORRIDOR.   DAY \nBEAN    walks along    the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then comes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van Gogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity, goes    in to switch    it off. \nWe see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room - with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly going to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the back the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the Programmer comes back in. \nPROGRAMMER What's happening here? \nBEAN Ahm... \nWith a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on white, then pop out completely. \nBEAN Ah.... Ahm.... \nBEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly. But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides down the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to breathe. \nCUT TO: INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      BOARDROOM - DAY \nLORD WALTON You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the \nAmericans are looking for something quite high powered.     A doctorate preferably... \nThere is a knock at the door. BEAN enters. LORD WALTON smiles. The rest of the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug. BEAN is very nervous indeed. \nLORD WALTON (gravely) Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news which will not, I'm afraid... \nThe phone rings. LORD WALTON answers. BEAN sits next to VINCENT and sniffs at him. VINCENT's breath hasn't improved. \nLORD WALTON (into phone) Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How? All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here will    you, dear boy. \nGRIERSON \nVarious things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very serious crap right now. \nHe can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up. \nThey are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges smiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes. \nGRIERSON So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel. \nBERNIE Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period. \nGRIERSON David? \nDAVID Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ... \nGRIERSON I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ... \nDAVID on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due? \nGRIERSON hands DAVID a piece of paper. \nGRIERSON Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that? \nPAUSE \nDAVID No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it. CUT TO: \nINT.    LONDON . PHOTO BOOTH.    DAY. \nThe camera faces Mr BEAN sitting in a Photo booth. His face is totally impassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes. And then, just before the 4th flash, he pulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen. Flash! He gives a little \nSatisfied giggle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.    THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY \n7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a bum-fluff moustache. \nDAVID gets out of his car and approaches them. \nDAVID Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some more. \nThe two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON, has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are laughing in the car as DAVID walks up. \nHe is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID. \nCHARLES Hello, David. \nDAVID Hi, Charles. (To Alison) Wow - late! \nALISON (brightly) I had to do some last minute stuff. \nCHARLES My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you, gallery going well? \nDAVID Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it .... \nALISON Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short. \nAlison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better - she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out. \nALISON Kevin!   You stop that right now! \nCHARLES Great kids.     Good looking too. \nDAVID You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay, looks-wise. \nCHARLES \nTake after their mother, huh? \nDAVID Ah ... absolutely. \nDAVID is not very happy here. \nCUT TO: INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - DAY \nIt is open plan and leads through into the lounge. DAVID and ALISON enter. ALISON puts her port folio on the table and leads DAVID onto a sofa. She puts her arms round him. \nALISON Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi. \nBEAN acts fast.    He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's cup of tea. \nHe sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A horrid experience for both. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   AEROPLANE - DAY. \nBoarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the elegance, and space of First class. \nBEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments from this nightmare flight. \n1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess slides it into the compartment above her head. \nOLD LADY Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter. \nThe next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks at BEAN suspiciously. \n2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man, whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual. \nChampagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well practised art).     No response. \nBEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face - straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless. \nThen 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his mouth, chews it into a spitball \nAnd rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under high pressure, shoots \ninto it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start. \n3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better. \n4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading. \nBut even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact with REYNOLDS'   flies. \nFrom across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked, comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON.... \n5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him. Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess. \n6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son isn't very well. \nBEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them. \nHe then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill to be impressed. \nBEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea. He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them. \nHe then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun. \nMeanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes, that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT \nThe traditional exit area. A random bunch of people are waiting - relatives, limousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'. \nThe LEARYS are at the barrier. KEVIN has a cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN' written on it. People are streaming out of the Arrivals gate. ALISON is not happy. Actually no one is. JENNIFER looks particularly fed up. \nDAVID \nFor all you know, he may be a very attractive young man. \nJENNIFER Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are ugly. \nDAVID What makes you say that? \nJENNIFER All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors. \nDAVID Richard Burton was very good-looking. \nJENNIFER Welsh. \nDAVID Sean Connery. \nALISON Scottish. \nDAVID Tom Jones? \nJENNIFER Welsh again. \nDAVID \nNo, no.   I'11 try again ... \nALISON I said, I'11 go. \nShe goes. KEVIN shakes his head disappointedly al,-- his father. DAVID slumps down on the seat. He overhears JENNIFER flirting with an incredibly undesirable bloke in a leather jacket - white, with Rasta hair extensions, and about sixty rings in his nose. (This is STINGO). \nJENNIFER So. where do your parents live? \nSTINGO My parents are dead. \nDAVID is pretty confident that he knows who killed them. \nJENNIFER Yeah, so are mine. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     TAXI RANK. NIGHT \nCOP 1 puts BEAN in the back of a taxi with his case.      He \ntakes some dollar notes from his own wallet and hands them to the driver. \nCOP 1 Just get him the hell out of here, will ya? \nHe slams the door and the taxi drives away. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT-.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT \nThe LEARYS are all asleep in eccentric positions on the seats. JENNIFER's head is resting on STINGO's leg. Kevin's cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN, written on it falls from his lap to the floor. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe taxi draws up outside the house.      BEAN gets out with his case.   The CAB DRIVER is strangely friendly. \nCAB DRIVER Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya. In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya, with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener, ya know that? \nBEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch, checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No answer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the key. He inspects things carefully. \nThe camera sees what he sees ... the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge ... and then he spots a little stone     frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is something he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN picks up the FROG to reveal the front     door key. It glints in the porch-light. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.     HALLWAY - NIGHT \nBEAN lets himself in. The pre-alarm buzzer goes off quietly. He has 15 seconds before the alarm goes off proper. He strolls confidently to where the alarm control unit obviously is ... under the stairs. \nClose-up of flashing L.E.D. Again, BEAN looks carefully and finds the magnetic box, housing a little key, attached to the underside of the console. Just as the alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its slot ... and is safe. \nBEAN finds the switch and turns on the hall light. He switches it off again ... then on. Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly.Fun. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.     THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT \nShot from across the street, with all the house lights flashing off and on madly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.     THE LEARY HOUSE.    LOUNGE - NIGHT \nBEAN stands in front of the television, looking a little annoyed about the fact that the remote control in his hand is having no effect at all. He stabs at it randomly. \nCUT TO: EXT.     THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe garage doors are swinging open and closed rhythmically. \nCUT TO: \nINT.     DAVID'S CAR - NIGHT \nKEVIN and JENNIFER are asleep in the back. DAVID drives in silence, Alison next to him. Uneasy atmosphere. DAVID stabs at buttons on the car radio. \nALISON It isn't working any more, David. \nDAVID I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it. Stupid thing. \nDAVID That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London Airport! \nHe finishes his teeth then runs the hot faucet.       He exits to bedroom as BEAN enters from hall with dirty socks. \nCUT TO: INT. THE LEARY HOUSE. D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT ALISON is still watching T.V. The volume is getting to DAVID. \nDAVID Alison, please. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.      BATHROOM ~ NIGHT \nBEAN is just finishing washing his socks in David's water. He rings the dirty water from them, and exits. DAVID enters in his under shorts. He checks his tired eyes in the mirror then washes his face in the basin water without looking. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      LANDING ~ NIGHT \nBEAN notices a framed photograph on the wall. It is of the LEARY family. They are grouped outside their house. It is a very happy picture. BEAN smiles at it. He takes it off the wall and takes it into a bedroom. As the door quietly closes we see the sign: 'JENNIFER'. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLights are out.       DAVID and ALISON in bed.    The latter is facing away. \nDAVID I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's important. \n(Long pause) \nALISON (without stirring) Go ahead. \nDAVID I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator. \nALISON smiles in spite of herself. She turns over and puts her arm around DAVID. She gets up close to his face. \nALISON There were three strawberries. \nDAVID One. \nALISON Liar. \nDAVID 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know. \nALISON smiles, sleepily, and goes to kiss him. She stops and sniffs. Thoroughly put off, she rolls over and closes her eyes. \nDAVID Ali?    What's wrong? \nALISON Your face smells like a foot. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY \nThe next morning. Shot from across the street: A newspaper boy delivers. Birds sing. It's a lovely, peaceful, early morning. Then ... a terrifying girl's scream pierces the quiet. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY \nThe whole family charges out onto the landing. JENNIFER hurtles out of her room screaming. She barges through the family and locks herself in the bathroom. \nALISON What is it?    Jennifer! \nJENNIFER (0.O.V.) ... There's a man ... there's a man ... there's a man in my... \nDAVID Honey, calm down now... it's okay... \nJENNIFER (p.o.v.) There's a man.    I woke up next to a man ... \nKEVIN \nIt wouldn't be the first time. \nALISON Shut up, Kevin. (to Jennifer) Honey, you-re not making sense ... \nDAVID It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust me. \nPause ... then a click of the bathroom lock ... Jennifer comes out. Then there's another click. BEAN breezes out of Jennifer's bedroom, past the family, in his pyjamas, carrying a wash bag and a towel over his arm. He waves to them friendly, slips into the bathroom and closes the door. The family stare in amazement. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE He doesn't like to say much does he? \nDAVID Right first time. \nANNIE I can understand THAT. Neither do I. \nAs BEAN and DAVID move on, BEAN gives ANNIE a 1ittle wave. She waves sweetly back. She cocks her head to one side and watches him go. She likes Mr. BEAN a lot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GRIERSON GALLERY. GROUND FLOOR- DAY \nBEAN and DAVID arrive In the ground floor gallery. A few visitors are viewing the paintings. The acknowledge ELMER, the huge, ex-army, Security Man, sitting on a small chair by a wall, reading a newspaper. The pass two oldish ladies inspecting a painting \nDAVID You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep aesthetic level. \nStay with the ladies as DAVID and BEAN head on. \nOLD LADY 1 What do you think? \nOLD LADY 2 0h yes - lovely - very nice. \nOLD LADY 1 And what colour would you use for the curtains? \nOLD LADY 2 Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom would be nice in this yellow .... \nAnd-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it. \nBEAN stops to admire a painting. It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber. She is wearing a chastity belt fastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag. \nIt is a tasteful and romantic picture. \nDAVID Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96. Know it? \nBEAN shakes his head. It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and smiles. ANNIE walks up. \nANNIE Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs. \nDAVID Thanks, Annie. \nANNIE walks off back the way she came, looking at BEAN approvingly over her shoulder. \nDAVID Better go.    Grierson hates people being late. \nBEAN Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ... \nHe gestures that held like to tidy up a little. Brush his hair, etc. BEAN waddles off after ANNIE clearly in need of relief. DAVID watches him go. \nDAVID Why me? \nCUT TO: \nINT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY. \nBEAN is catching up with ANNIE. She notices him following and coyly smiles to herself. She stops, turns round and grins. She thinks he has come to say something to her. \nBEAN stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's washroom. ANNIE's smile fades. \nCUT TO: \nINT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   WASH ROOM - DAY \nBEAN    comes out of a booth. He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror. He pushes down    the pressurised tap to wash his hands. It splashes terribly. The whole front    of his trousers are soaked. The last thing you want when about to meet your    new boss. Damn! \nThere now follow a quick, complicated piece of business. \n1/ BEAN spots a paper-towel dispenser. He turns towards it at just the moment a man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers, as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the last towel. Damn again. \n2/ BEAN    now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel. But it's rather high. He has to jump    to try to    reach the trouser.     At which point Another Man enters. Jumping    BEAN has    been caught in a very    weird position. He pretends he has .chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise routine. \n3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth. Another Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more exercises. That man also enters a booth. \n4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work. Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's working excellently. \n5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly and polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb. \n6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the water - and soaks himself all over again. At which moment, DAVID enters, exasperated. \nDAVID Come on!     Let's go! \nBEAN exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch.          They enter the corridor, and he spots a newspaper. \nDAVID You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir. \nGRIERSON beams. \nMIX THROUGH TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nEnd of the day.. ANNIE perks    up at the reception desk as DAVID, but especially BEAN, approaches    from the gallery area. She has a pile of tissues near-by and draws a    heart on one of them. She arranges it on the counter-top where BEAN could    not fail to see it on his way to the exit. \nDAVID Goodnight Annie. \nANNIE Night. \nBEAN does not even notice her.    As DAVID heads for the exit, BEAN suddenly sneezes. \nHe reaches for ANNIE's love message and blows his nose on it. He drops the tissue in a bin as he exits. \nANNIE sighs her disappointment. \nCUT TO: EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BY PARKING LOT - DAY \n(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask, performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers. \nThe MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman quickly moves on. \nBEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass wall, and hits the MIME's nose. \nCUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off. \nThe MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.    He \ntakes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed. \nThe MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns .... \nBut now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it. \nThe MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the terrified MIME. \nFinally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50 yards away. \nBEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded, leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same as this morning). \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT - DAY \nDAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible. \nDAVID \nOkay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good. Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right, Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay? \nBEAN nods.   DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.   Nearby woman tramp (BAG LADY) goes   through a trash can. \nBEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate. \nBEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to them as if to say: \"Are these yours?\" \n[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.] \nThen suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall, weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight, \na PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old friend, the MIME. \nROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his pockets ... \nBEAN leans into shot.     He holds out the keys, grinning. \nROBBER Gimme the keys! \nBEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman. He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual. \nROBBER I said, give me the keys! \nBEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground, the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality. \nBut not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face, ticking him off for breaking the rules. \nROBBER OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!! \nKEVIN That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. \nDAVID Well, there is that ... \nKEVIN (TO BEAN ) I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers? \nBEAN Ahm.... \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.   KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKEVIN is playing an adventure game: `GOBLINS 2' [This game exists.] The GOBLINS chuckle and make stupid noises that BEAN can imitate. A catchy piece of music accompanies the game. \nThe computer monitor shows the inside of the WIZARD's house. KEVIN moves the GOBLINS, and two little characters, FINGUS and WINKLE, around the room by clicking on areas in the room with his mouse. \nBEAN and KEVIN are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper. \nKEVIN It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2. \nBEAN is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little GOBLINS. He gets his delighted face right up to the screen. He sings along with the catchy tune. KEVIN is getting frustrated. \nKEVIN Come on, winkle. \nKEVIN clicks on a cuckoo clock in the WIZARD's room.       The cuckoo pops out holding a key in its beak. \nKEVIN It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo. \nBEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly clicks on the frog. \nBEAN Click, click, click, click, click ... \nThe frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.       KEVIN gets excited. \nKEVIN How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!! \nBEAN grins and makes WINKLE pick up the stone. Then he clicks through to inside the wizard's house. He makes WINKLE throw the stone at the cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak. \nKEVIN Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool! \nKEVIN slaps BEAN on the back.      BEAN is delighted.   Close on monitor, showing The Goblin game- \nCUT TO: \nINT.   LIVING ROOM.    DAY \nAnother game. JENNIFER'S Super Nintendo game on TV in the lounge area. It is a Gothic game where he-man types attack Vampires and bats with swords. \nDAVID is in the kitchen - setting out the roses in a vase.    The door opens - enter ALISON. Some tension. \nDAVID Hi, \nALISON Hi..... (PAUSE ) Roses. \nDAVID Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner that will kill you. \nALISON Great. ( SHE SETTLES A LITTLE ) You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you? \nDAVID Sort of half..... \nALISON Meaning? \nDAVID I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake. \nALISON Honestly David, you're so spineless. \nPause. Jennifer looks around.   She can't help but hear.   Not a happy experience. \nDAVID Roses.     Wine. \nHe is asking her for softness. Pause. At which moment BEAN enters wearing pointy hat. He helps himself to a melon from a bowl. He grins and exits. ALISON looks at DAVID sadly. \nALISON But no real change. \nAlmost instantly, BEAN is back. He rummages through a drawer and takes out some large elastic bands. And leaves. \nALISON I really do need some time on my own. Away from here. \nDAVID Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak. And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi. You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk. \nALISON Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk. \nDAVID Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do it) ... to say good night. Okay? \nBEAN nods.    DAVID smiles and goes to the door. \nBE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head. \nDAVID Spineless. CUT TO: \nINT.   DAVID AND ALISON'S BEDROOM. \nThe first morning without ALISON.    \"She's Gone\" by Hall & Oats begins to play, a song full of yearning. \nDAVID feels the other side of the bed.    No-one there. \nHe walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the bedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it \" He takes a towel from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone. \nHe removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone - she's gone\" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all. BEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself, wearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them. \nCUT TO: INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   CANTEEN - DAY. \nDAVID sitting down at table, with BEAN, who is tucking in happily ~ eating a burger & bun with knife and fork. DAVID speaks after a longish pause. \nDAVID Bean can I ask you something? \nBEAN nods. \nDAVID Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think? \nBEAN thinks hard, then looks at his watch, makes his excuses and simple walks away. \nCUT TO: \nINT.    GALLERY CORRIDOR.     DAY. \nBEAN at a pay phone.      He dials carefully- CUT TO: \nINT.    BEAN'S BED-SIT.     DAY \n10 am U.K.    time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on the T.V. A    morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet away from    a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles, stretching    out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an angel. It     rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock). \nThere is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe. \nBEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied to its handle becomes taut. \nCUT TO: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it. The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket. The T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard hotel'. \nCUT TO: \nINT.    CANTEEN.   DAY. \nBEAN returns, sits down and starts to eat again. David is still deep in thought. \nDAVID \nWell, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just ... take today shall we? \nBEAN nods.    He is not on David's emotional level here. \nDAVID I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame. She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the flesh? \nSure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's Mother. BEAN nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers. \nCUT TO: \nINT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY. \nBEAN and David en route to the painting. \nDAVID I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but' let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great works of art is true, huh? \nCUT TO: \nINT.    THE WHOLE GALLERY - DAY \nBEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors - in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard. \nThe three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green and a buzzer sounds. \nThen there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds. \nDAVID As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right? \nCUT TO: \nINT.-GRIERSON GALLERY.     OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nPause. Then out comes BEAN, drying his empty hands, miming, \"Sorry, Sorry.\". We see into the toilet. nothing there. No sign of the painting. BEAN turns sharply left. \nCUT TO: EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY \nDAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds.       We can see the side of the whole gallery in shot as they talk. \nBERNIE I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project today. \nDAVID Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know? \nBERNIE Howls he getting on with the family? \nDAVID Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great. \nWe will be slightly distracted by      the observation that Whistler's Mother, America's most valuable painting,      is at this moment balanced on a very thin ledge three floors up - where Bean      has put in, outside the Men's room window. A bird and then a couple       more birds perch on it. \nBERNIE And howls Alison? \nDAVID She's ... well, she's good. \nBERNIE Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking. \nDAVID Yes, isn't he. \nBERNIE \nIt's great when people who work together can become real friends. \nDAVID Isn't it? \nBERNIE I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that way, huh? \nDAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely. \nNow we see BEAN's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window. He    can't reach the painting at first.     So he stretches further and further out   the window. No good. Finally he has     to go out on the ledge. He shoos away    the birds, who then decide to settle on    him instead. Finally he gets a hand on    the painting. As he does so, he loses    hold. He just manages to grabs a window    before he falls. \nDAVID Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy. \nBERNIE Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure. \nPeriod. \nBEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go. \nBERNIE By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or we're all in the crap house. What     do you think? \nDAVID 'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right? \nBERNIE Not necessarily. That's where this ... ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN ) comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough. \nBERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and .... \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.   STOREROOM - DAY. \nA small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through the window. He has the picture and is safe. \nHe sets the picture down on a table.      Darn!   The birds have done their business on it. \nHe maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs. This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new. \nBEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror, America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas. \nBEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like Danny de Vito. \nBean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately, there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more. Total destruction. \nCUT TO: \nINT.     GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY. \nBEAN Hurries down the corridor with his pseudo-trolley again, and a vaguely mad look on his face. He spots ANNIE at a drinks machine. She smiles sweetly (here comes her man) BEAN takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor. ANNIE is hurt. \nANNIE True love can be very hard. \nCUT TO: \nBEAN Actually I'm not a... \nDAVID That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes. \nGRIERSON Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself... \nDAVID No! \nGRIERSON Er ... pray tell me why? \nELMER Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why. \nBEAN and DAVID die and go to hell until ELMER laughs at his own little joke. GRIERSON laughs too. \nELMER I better continue my rounds, sir.. \nHe strolls away. \nDAVID The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift. \nGRIERSON Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh? \nDAVID Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she, Bean? \nBEAN Oh yes. \nDAVID Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints .... \nBEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing. \nThe colours are beginning to fade. However ~     if you give me just one little year I can restore the picture to its original    glory, the way it looked when Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said....    0 Actually I'm not sure you've got the hair right, darling.\" By the way, your    hair is looking great today, sir. \nGRIERSON Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth \nis, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ... \nDAVID ... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In fact I'll go right now. \nGRIERSON No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother. \nDAVID lets out a little yelp. \nGRIERSON Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you? \nDAVID Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo. \nGRIERSON leaves.    DAVID turns to BEAN. \nDAVID Bean.   Do you drink? \nBEAN shakes his head. \nDAVID Neither do I. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   BAR - NIGHT \nIt is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their drinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the sports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball. \nBEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much whisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit and paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite, slurs his words: \nDAVID It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job - lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean? \nHe turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose. \nDAVID I guess not. \nHe fills his glass from a bottle. \nYou know, I don't get it. The New Artist     exhibition-this year - people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but ... the place didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't     full but I saw people. I just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have to sell the Whistler. \nHe looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril. DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely .... \nDAVID He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it? \nBARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought, taking a huge swig from his drink. \nDAVID ... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then, I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels. \nBEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut high into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it with his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive. \nANNIE Did he now? \nKEVIN He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain cell count of about two and a half. \nANNIE Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually. (to Bean) But I'm great in bed. \nBEAN is unsettled by this.     He gives a shudder and heads for the gallery. \nKEVIN Catch you later, babe.(goes after Bean) Come on, Beanie - there must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't do anything. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.    DAY. \nBERNIE, DAVID and GRIERSON. BERNIE looks very confident at a computer monitor. A painting is in fact 'doing' something, on the computer screen, as the girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can. \nGRIERSON Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David? \nDAVID Certainly is. \nBERNIE We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Governor. \nGRIERSON Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team. \nDAVID slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team.      He looks \nto the poster of Whistler's Mother behind GRIERSON's desk. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY \nKEVIN and BEAN have found a computer,    also showing BERNIE's Gallery programme. The monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery. KEVIN clicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture. As KEVIN works the mouse, BEAN hums the catchy tune from    'GOBLINS 21. It's play time again. \nKEVIN This is way cool, Beanie. \nHe clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the provenance of the painting. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   THE WHISTLER ROOM. DAY \nDAVID is overseeing things. There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit away from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained. ELMER brings in two large flower displays. BERNIE enters. \nBERNIE Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who actually gets things done. \nHe exits. BERNIE is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the minute. DAVID pulls a face at ELMER. \nDAVID You arrange those flowers yourself? \nELMER Sure did. \nDAVID They're pretty.   Learn it in the army? \nELMER No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY \nThe final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, \"we're getting ready\" music. \n1.    Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc. And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting. \n2.    BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in the gallery flickers and starts up. \n3.    ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational. She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an imaginary V.I.P. \n4.    ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat with scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them proudly with his sleeve. \n5.    GRIERSON watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out from the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY \nClose on the bottom    of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs, wearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As they walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to reveal that this is    BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by GRIERSON at the main    entrance. \nGRIERSON What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. (checks a prompt card). \nBERNIE And that's where you introduce me to the Governor. \nIt's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and wants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. The crowd moves back. \nDAVID I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with his new friend. \nREYNOLDS is flattered. Silence. DAVID inserts the plastic card key - opens the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'. Respectful silence. \nREYNOLDS is delighted.     He stands back to inspect her. \nREYNOLDS Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to me - or should I say ten million dollars! \nEveryone applauds. \nGRIERSON Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it \nmyself, rather 'expensive' champagne. (grins smugly) \nPeople start to file out. REYNOLDS, GRIERSON, BERNIE and DAVID stay behind. DAVID spots BEAN arriving. He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a slightly dazed smile. DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over. \nDAVID Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from England. \nThey turn to each other - recognition from BEAN \"it's the man from the plane\". He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before REYNOLDS recognises him... \nBEAN Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ... \nBEAN turns. In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone getting too close to the great painting. He spins and falls in the direction of the painting. \nCUT TO: the looks of horror on all the faces. \nCUT TO: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing. We think he's going to tear the painting. He doesn't. He simply catches hold of the bottom of the ornate frame. It ,,snaps off. \nCUT TO: a look of relief for an instant on all faces. \nCUT TO: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip, saying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER\"- \nCUT TO: a look of horror on all faces. \nCUT TO: ELMER looking like someone has just murdered his own mother. \nCUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN. CUT TO: \nINT.   GALLERY CORRIDOR.   DAY. \nGovernor REYNOLDS storming through the Gallery, with -BERNIE and GRIERSON scampering after him. \nREYNOLDS You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!? \nGRIERSON Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      WHISTLER ROOM - DAY. \nDAVID and BEAN stand alone in silence, in front of the debris. BEAN is absolutely destitute. DAVID stares at him. BEAN just lifts his hands. Totally sad. What will, what can DAVID say to him? Finally, DAVID just puts his hands on his shoulder. \nDAVID Nice try, kiddo. \nBEAN cant quite believe he's forgiven. At which moment, there is a knock on the door. ANNIE enters, holding KEVIN's hand. \nANNIE David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife. \nDAVID Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later. \nThen he notices the worried expressions on ANNIE and KEVIN's faces. \nANNIE She's calling from the hospital ... \nBEAN and DAVID both take this in.      DAVID turns and runs towards the reception area. ANNIE calls after him. \nANNIE She's on line three! \nKEVIN grabs BEAN's hand and they both run after DAVID.      ANNIE watches BEAN go and sighs. \nANNIE Such... great buns. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GALLERY ENTRANCE HALL.   DAY. \nThe party is in disarray. In the background, DAVID is on the phone at the reception counter with KEVIN and BEAN. BRUTUS hovers, he suspects BEAN - wants to question him. \nREYNOLDS I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys. \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   RECEPTION - DAY \nMuch hustle and bustle. DAVID is getting directions from a nurse at the desk. He beckons to KEVIN and BEAN and strides, purposely towards a corridor. They hurry to catch him up, and Bean treat on the back of his shoe. DAVID turns and shouts at him. \nDAVID Just stay away from me!   D'you hear? \nHe takes KEVIN's hand and storms away round a corner. BEAN is taken aback not knowing what to do or where to go. He is really feeling sorrow now. He's shaken. All part of his slow coming to feel things properly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY \nDAVID and KEVIN turns a corner - and stop, frozen. There, sitting alone, on a bench, outside JENNIFER's room, is ALISON. She gets to her feet. Their eyes meet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY -DAY \nA crowd outside the gallery, look off camera. The camera follows BERNIE's gaze and takes in the modern car sculpture. Where there were two cars face down in the earth, there are now three, the new addition being Governor's pride and Joy. The three cars form a tall pyramid. \nClose on REYNOLDS' face. GRIERSON approaches. \nREYNOLDS Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass. \nGRIERSON nods - he's got the message. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR. DAY \nALISON and DAVID are standing where they were before, three paces apart. ALISON is upset, tired and drawn. \nALISON They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just kind of taking time out. (to Kevin) Hi, tough guy. (to David) It's a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while. \nA doctor passes \nDAVID Excuse me. \nDOCTOR 1 I'll be back in a minute. \nDAVID Okay, great. \nALISON looks at him. We don't quite read the expression but somewhere under there we know she's thinking \"yup, he's still ineffective.\" \nALISON At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you. \nDAVID Ah, well .... CUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - DAY \nBEAN is looking for his friends.        A doctor sweeps by him.   A nurse behind. \nNURSE Doctor Jacobson? \nDOCTOR JACOBSON Yes? \nNURSE We need you urgently in C Theatre. \nDOCTOR JACOBSON Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 .... \nNURSE It is urgent, sir. \nDOCTOR JACOBSON Okay..... \nThe doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he .goes.         BEAN sees it, picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.     RECEPTION - DAY \nELMER is at the busy reception desk and has been talking with a nurse. \nELMER No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now. \nELMER is obviously moved to find out about JENNIFER. He moves towards the exit ... He is surprised to see BUCK, the night-shift guard, dressed in civvies, sitting with outpatients. \nELMER Buck? \nBUCK looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room close-by. ELMER shakes his head and leaves. \nCUT TO: \nBEAN beams at her.      He's impressed - and feels he's accepted.    He leaves. \nALISON He's not too bad.       I can live with him. \nDAVID I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE LEARY'S KITCHEN.     NIGHT \nLooking in front outside, we see Alison sit down. We see, ,but do not hear David start to talk. Within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.     DAY. \nWith heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate. Pan across the familiar faces. DAVID. BERNIE. ELMER. ANNIE. BEAN, looking nervous and shifty. Dead silence as GRIERSON stands, very solemnly. \nGRIERSON Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice- President. \nCUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this. \nGRIERSON He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century. \nBERNIE Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ... \nGRIERSON Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius. \nBEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods sagely. \nInsurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So, surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say, one helluva little man. Watch this. \nEveryone is totally at a     loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster of Whistler's Mother on     the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An electric motor starts to     whirrrr ... \nThe glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original oil of Whistler's Mother. \nGRIERSON Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother! \nThere are gasps from the room.     BEAN is open mouthed. \nGRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively.      He's saved! \nGRIERSON The best security in the world is no match for a master criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were so rudely interrupted by events. \nThe room is emptying.     DAVID and BEAN stand there, DAVID stunned.   GRIERSON heads over. \nGRIERSON David, David, David ... \nDAVID I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen? \nGRIERSON Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse. \nDavid But .... \nGRIERSON I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie will. \nBERNIE looks across from the computer and smiles.      BEAN has his eyes on DAVID. He is mortified by what's \nhappening.   GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression. \nGRIERSON Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite bathroom. \nDAVID glares at BERNIE.     BEAN is thinking 'No!   I don't want to stay with horrible BERNIE.' \nGRIERSON How are you making out there? \nBERNIE All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be quite a show. \nHe presses an intercom.    He's enjoying himself. \nHi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler. Would you please watch your video screens. You're in for a treat, guys. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   VARIOUS ROOMS.   DAY. \nAll the staff in all the rooms, gallery, canteen, corridors, look up at various screens. Cut round rooms during this flashy demonstration. \nBERNIE (V/0) Here you can see our new interactive gallery guide.    Every picture in the gallery will have its own story to tell. \nA Van Gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens \nMy friends, good news. Mr Schimmel is not only no longer Vice- President. He actually no longer works here. \nBERNIE But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit suspicious that it's here at his fingertips. (pointing at Bean) There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me up! \nPause. All eyes turn to BEAN.     CUT TO people watching the big screens everywhere. \nGRIERSON Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that? \nBEAN looks long and hard at BERNIE. \nBEAN Yes- (PAUSE) It's exceedingly rude to point. \nAnd punches BERNIE sharply in the nose.    Everyone in the gallery bursts into applause. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY. \nHalf an hour later. Police cars draw up.      BERNIE is shoved in the back seat of one. GRIERSON, BEAN & DAVID watch. \nGRIERSON (to uniformed cop) I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd \nalso ask him a few questions about the destruction of the Whistler copy. \nBEAN nods his head firmly.    The car pulls away.     Then breaks and reverses. The SIDE-KICK gets out. \nSIDE~KICK Oh, yeah - I forgot. \nSIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.    He takes out a huge bunch of flowers. \nThe chief said I was to give you these. \nBEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.      What a nasty stink.    Not his sort of thing at all. \nSIDE-KICK drives AWAY.   GRIERSON turns to DAVID. \nGRIERSON I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not. \nDAVID VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ... \nHe looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine.       DAVID gets the message, and changes his tune.. \nLet me think about that, Thomas.     We'd have to talk quite a salary hike. \nGRIERSON Of course. \nDAVID And a car. \nGRIERSON Mmmmm... \nDAVID Maybe two cars. \nGRIERSON A car sounds sensible. \nDAVID And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up. \nDAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky flowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She beams with delight: after all, he DID love her. \nBEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.       As they go, DAVID puts an arm \nround BEAN. \nWho shoos him away instantly.           No sloppiness for him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.          HALL - DAY. \nThe LEARY family in a group.           JENNIFER's arm in a sling. \nALISON well, it's been... unusual. But thank you. \nShe goes to kiss BEAN - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly. Then moves on to JENNIFER. \nJENNIFER Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time. \nHe shakes her broken arm firmly ... and she screams again. \nDAVID Come on          hurry or we'll be late. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_input": "He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with DAVID's key card. \nThe job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET.    NIGHT- \nBEAN zipping along on the skate board with his suitcase. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.      UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT. \nBUCK, trouserless, is sitting, reading a newspaper next to a noisy washing machine. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      BEAN'S ROOM.    NIGHT.   KITCHEN - DAY \nBEAN lies back in bed with quiet satisfaction. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   DAVID'S ROOM.      MORNING. \nDAVID wakes with a violent start. \nDAVID 0 my God. Tell it vas a dream. \nThe door swings open.       It is Bean with a tray of coffee and toast. \nBEAN Morning. \nDAVID It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito. \nBEAN \nWell, Ahm.... \nHe laughs cheerily. \nDAVID What? \nCUT TO: \nINT.   DAVID'S CAR. \nBean is still chuckling. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GALLERY.    CORRIDOR. \nStill highly amused, BEAN      guides DAVID in the direction of Whistler's Room. David takes out his key to      open the room - but the door swings open. DAVID is shocked. There stands       GRIERSON, looking straight at Whistler's Mum. In all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory. \nGRIERSON I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s. \nDAVID Ahm.... \nGRIERSON Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want anything to go wrong. \nDAVID Quite right, sir. \nGrierson leaves.    David gets close to the painting and peers .... \nDAVID Wait a minute. \nBEAN just puts his finger to his mouth... \nBEAN Ssshhhh. \nHe lets out a hug smile - he can solve the problems of the world, as well as create them. \nINT. THE LEARY HOUSE. HALL- SATURDAY \nJENNIFER skips down t-he stairs, carrying a trendy duffel bag, just as DAVID enters from the kitchen. \nJENNIFER Bye, Dad. \nDAVID Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen? \n", "test1_true": "JENNIFER Be serious, Dad.    It's Saturday. \nShe exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY \nJENNIFER is heading down the path.    DAVID runs out of the house and catches up with her. \nDAVID Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and with your mom away ... I really need you. \nA powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the opposite direction. JENNIFER runs over to it. The bike's rider turns off his engine and removes his helmet. It is STINGO, the white Rasta from the airport, with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose. \nSTINGO (to DAVID) You. \nHe hands JENNIFER a helmet. \nJENNIFER Don't worry, Dad.    I'll be home. Monday, after school. \nBEAN and KEVIN arrive at DAVID's side to spectre. \nKEVIN Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver. \nDAVID (angry now) Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps! Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable. \nJENNIFER has put on the helmet and is climbing onto the back of the bike. \nJENNIFER Great, Dad. You promised you'd get rid of him! (points at Bean) And as for: \"how we do things in this family. We don't have a family till you get Mom back. \nShe slaps STINGO on the shoulder.    STINGO kicks the starter lever.    Nothing. \nAgain.     Nothing ... \nJENNIFER Come on Sting! \nKEVIN Sting?!   Sounds like something you put on a rash. \nSTINGO is still kicking the starter.       DAVID is desperate. \nDAVID Don't just stand there, Bean - do something. \nBEAN instantly takes on the hero's mantle and runs to the bike. DAVID is not far behind him. STINGO is still trying to kick start it. BEAN takes out a small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine. \nThe bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive and down the road. BEAN stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with himself indeed. \nDAVID To BEAN )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin! (not such    a good idea) Uh --- Right! Kevin. You get inside and look after    ... uh... (that would be a worse idea) Right! Get in the car!     Both of you. Jesus! \nCUT TO: \nINT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nDAVID, BEAN and KEVIN at the reception desk. \nANNIE So, Kevin.    How's it going? \nKEVIN Badly.    You wanna adopt me? \nANNIE smiles cutely at BEAN.       DAVID is still rattled. \nANNIE Big day today, huh? \nDAVID Uh ... yes ... \nDAVID looks askance at BEAN.       BERNIE hurries up and takes DAVID to one side. \nBERNIE Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future. \nDAVID Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that. \nBERNIE \nYou're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. (he hugs him and laughs). Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss. \nDAVID calls to ANNIE. \nDAVID Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after Bean. \nHe heads off with BERNIE.     Back at the counter.   BEAN, KEVIN & ANNIE. \nKEVIN My Dad told me all about you. \n", "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.     RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nThe staff and various dignitaries are lined, looking out through the glass in anticipation. Through the glass we see a couple of Police Motorcycle Escorts pull up outside followed by a beautiful, old, classic Rolls Royce. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY \nThe red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door. Close on the bottom of the driver's door. It opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing army boots and khaki trousers. \nThe legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before heading on. \nBRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.       They are the Police presence today. \nGRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance. \nGRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.       BERNIE is frowning - not happy about that uniform. \nGRIERSON what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome. \nREYNOLDS Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s reunion after. \nGRIERSON Not at all, Governor.    Very striking. \nREYNOLDS takes in GRIERSON's suit. \nREYNOLDS Interesting suit. \nGRIERSON (Beaming) Why thank you sir. \nREYNOLDS off the peg? \nGRIERSON (crestfallen ) Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ... \nHe gestures to BERNIE but REYNOLDS cuts in and hands BERNIE a set of car keys. \nREYNOLDS (To Bernie) Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son. \nBERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a \"don't be stupid\" smile and follows the Governor. \nBEAN (wearing \"Dr Bean\" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door, thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to delegate. \nBERNIE Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you. \nBEAN assents happily. BRUTUS spies BEAN over his shoulder and frowns - its that mad English guy again. BEAN gets to the door and sees the Governor's car. Yummy! \nCUT TO: INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nGRIERSON leads REYNOLDS to the reception counter, as BERNIE sneaks up to take his position again. ELMER is in the background trying to look professional, deferring to BRUTUS. \nANNIE steps out from behind the counter, curtsies and ,shakes REYNOLDS' hand. \nANNIE Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller than you were half an hour ago. \nREYNOLDS Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much. \nANNIE Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does she 0 have a decent job? \nREYNOLDS Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine. \nHe spots KEVIN and winks at him.      KEVIN smiles back. CUT TO: \nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY. \nBEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather seat. \nHe starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact. Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left. \nBEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the one he's used to. \nHe takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't large enough. \nWith a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process. BEAN looks a tadge concerned. \nCUT TO: \nINT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY. \nREYNOLDS has moved on to ELMER who salutes crisply.         REYNOLDS returns the salute with pride. \n", "test2_true": "ELMER Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I didn't know where I was. \nREYNOLDS Well, congratulations soldier. CUT TO: \nEXT.    PARKING LOT - DAY. \nBEAN sitting in the wedged car. He tries       the door - but it won't open a centimetre. He's totally stuck. He looks        up at a small window in the roof. If only he could get that open. He pushes      various buttons, which set of windscreen wipers, squirters, radios. He       pushes the cigarette lighter. Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet      pops up an inch. \nAt which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the seat beside him. Not good news. \nBEAN panics a bit, turns and half      climbs over into    the back   seat, when he spies a drinks cabinet. He has a       very good idea -    he finds   a cut crystal decanter of brown liquid, opens it      and uses it to    douse the   fire. Not a wise move with brandy. Before the       cut, we see the    WHOOOSH!   of a major fire in the front seat of the car. \nCUT TO: \nINT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY. \nGRIERSON leads REYNOLDS towards the main gallery. He points up to the video screen they are passing, which shows the two of them walking along - as does every screen in the gallery. REYNOLDS is impressed. He glances at DAVID in passing. \nREYNOLDS \nNice tie, fella. \nDAVID grins to himself. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   PARKING LOT - DAY. \nThe front of the car isn't    what it was. There has been a big fire. It's out now - three decanters lie    empty. BEAN is not happy. Finally, he decides to go for brute strength. He     turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and puts his foot down on the    accelerator. \nWe see the car from above. Full throttle. Totally still. Totally still. And then WHOOOOSH WHAM!!! It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing violently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens, Bernie's car. \nCUT TO \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    GROUND FLOOR - DAY \nREYNOLDS stops to admire a small painting - a twelfth century 'Crucifixion of Christ'. \nGRIERSON Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think? \nREYNOLDS Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we? \nBERNIE spots a slightly concerned DAVID. \nBERNIE Everything okay, David? \nDAVID Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to. \nBERNIE He's just parking the Governor's car. \nDAVID Great - keep him out of trouble. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   PARKING LOT - DAY. \nBEAN is inspecting the car. He's not too happy with it. '.He tries to get the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. He shrugs his shoulders and gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by leaning his head out. This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that appears out of the ground. When he hits it, the car stops dead. \nBEAN gets out,    leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the attendant would    be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. Inside he pushes a couple    of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier. Less hurrah, he    has forgotten to put on the hand brake. \nAs he moves    back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the outside of    the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly sharp turn,    smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. We hear a crash - but    do not see where it lands. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    GROUND FLOOR - DAY \nGOVERNOR REYNOLDS turns away from another picture. \nREYNOLDS Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now?      My eyes are making my feet sore, as my wife would say. \nDAVID Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way. \nThe party follows DAVID as he walks through the gallery, towards the double doors, to take the lift to the Whistler Room. An excited atmosphere. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   WHISTLER ROOM.    DAY. \nEveryone enters. \nDAVID Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you. \n", "test3_input": "DOCTOR 2 Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to deal with here, sir. \nALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins. DAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN points to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from it. \nAnother doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.       He's young, confident slightly arrogant. \nALISON Excuse me, doctor. \nDOCTOR Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course. \nALISON Okay. \nDAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless! \nDAVID Say that again, son. \nDOCTOR I beg your pardon? \nDAVID I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now. \nDOCTOR I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time. \nDAVID We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. \nA hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before. \nDAVID So,    why not haul    your    ... (checks) nice little ass into this room and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence and    attention you    are    going to give her case. \nDOCTOR Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good. \nDAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her Head `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to himself,    and nods .... n Come on! \nDAVID Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will you? \nBEAN nods enthusiastically and backs off. \nALISON Smiling         Well, well. \nCUT TO: \nINT.     HOSPITAL.    JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nClose on an E.C.G. monitor, green lines on black screen. DAVID and ALISON sit by JENNIFER's bed. JENNIFER is unconscious. She has her arm in a cast and a small Band-Aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged. \nKEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier). It is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game. KEVIN    is immersed in it. \nALISON Let's get a coffee. \nDAVID Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company. \nALISON exits. David follows. BEAN enters.               He sees JENNIFER for the first time. Sympathy shows in his eyes. \nKEVIN Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire bats. \nBEAN is determined to help. He sits down with KEVIN. The game continues. The he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. Lots of noise, but JENNIFER sleeps on. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nBy a drinks machine.    ALISON finishes drinking from a plastic cup. \nALISON Disgusting. \nShe looks up at DAVID, who's looking at her.     Slowly she gets close and puts her arms around him. She's a bit tearful. \nDAVID Everything's gonna be fine. \nALISON (pause) About Charles... \nDAVID shhh... \nALISON It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was the last time we laughed? Any of us? \nDAVID I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard. \nKEVIN Dad... \nThey look down to see KEVIN has arrived. \nKEVIN These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ... \n", "test3_true": "HOSPITAL PORTER Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down the hall that could use ... \nDAVID Wait a minute .... (about to get tough again) \nALISON Please. It's okay.      Really. (to David) Wow - who put the fire in you, my' man? \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJENNIFER is still asleep. BEAN is sitting on the end of her bed. He looks at the SUPER NINTENDO console thinking, \"How can I get this working again? How can I help?\" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the E.C.G. machine, monitoring Jennifer's heart. BEAN has an idea. \nHe yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead.        Producing his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nDAVID, ALISON and KEVIN walk back towards the room. \nALISON Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. \nDAVID Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch. \nShe and DAVID manage to share a smile. They're going to get through this. Suddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from JENNIFER's room. KEVIN registers this and is puzzled. Then ALISON and DAVID notice it. \nDAVID I thought you said.... CUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.     JENNIFER'S ROOM - DAY \nThe LEARYS appear in the open doorway.       Their expressions turn from curiosity to horror. \nBEAN has plugged the SUPER NINTENDO games system into the       back of JENNIFER's E.C.G. monitor. A couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most worrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing Jennifer's faint vital signs ... \nALISON gasps.      DAVID slowly moves into the room. \nDAVID Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you hear me? Come on now... \nBut BEAN is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer. DAVID approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... CUT TO: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the pulse light ... \nDAVID dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his sword. DAVID has landed on top of JENNIFER. The pulse light explodes and the monitor screen whites-out. JENNIFER wakes up with a start. \nJENNIFER Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom? \nALISON covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back.        She laughs. \nDAVID and KEVIN stare at JENNIFER. They can't help but join in the laughter. JENNIFER has no idea what's going on. BEAN is happy that everyone is happy. \nKEVIN I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do not lie! \nALISON grins at him.      Then at BEAN. \nMIX THROUGH TO: \nINT.   LEARY HOUSE.     KITCHEN.   NIGHT. \nALISON is fixing some coffee.       DAVID enters. \nDAVID Here, let me do that. \nALISON No, I'm fine. \nHe just stands there. \nokay - you grind the beans, and \nHe moves towards her - his arms slip round her waist. \n... put them in the .... ( but she can't concentrate I don't believe this. I'm being seduced by my own husband. \nPause. They are just about to kiss when BEAN enters. He's a bit impatient. \nBEAN Ahm - excuse me ... ( POINTING TO HIS WATCH ) You know.. \nThey jump apart.      The moment is gone. \nALISON Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready. \nALISON takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots. \nALISON There.     Is that how you like them? \n"}

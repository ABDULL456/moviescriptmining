{"test1_input": "DR. BEAN \nBy \nRichard Curtis \nAnd \nRobin Driscoll \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARDROOM - DAY \nA very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the walls. \nA group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. They are the trustees of the National Gallery. LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To his right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON fidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to speak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to fidgeting. So does everyone else. \nCUT TO: \nCREDIT.   POLYGRAM & WORKING TITLE PRESENT. CUT TO: \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARD ROOM - DAY \nThe scene is as silent and static as we left it Last... then: \nGARETH I suppose we could just sack him. CUT TO: \nEXT.   MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY \nMr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world- \nHe walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes. The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending their car. \nBEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside, fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening speed with a smug look     on his face. \nThe Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits. \nBEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound fault. \nBEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps violently. \nBEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune. \nOn he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful traffic. \nHeels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight- line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S \nsatisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls. \nBut at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's outside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door. BEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store. \nINT.    HARRODS.   DAY. \nBEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and leather glove racks. \nCUT TO a Security Guard. As       he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car just shoots behind him. The       Guard continues through the Children's section there are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the Lime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past. \nThe moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps. \nCUT TO: \n6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see what it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street. \nEXT.    KNIGHTSBRIDGE.     DAY. \nOut in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned. \nCUT TO: EXT.    THE STRAND.     DAY. \nAn Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off, and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery and the mini. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.    NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY \nBEAN    gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and takes    out a \"Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the back    window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re- locks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work. \nAs he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that Board meeting was taking place. \nCUT TO: INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARDROOM - DAY \nGARETH Look, I don't hate the man but ... \n", "test1_true": "A grand gentleman, MR MORRISON, pipes up. \nI'm MORRISON Heels got the feeling back in his fingers - but his hands are still stapled together. \nLORD WALTON Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert? \nHUBERT Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak, Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than .... useful? \nA glimmer of hope. \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    PORTRAIT SECTION - DAY \nBEAN wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them. He passes a guard. \nGUARD (not looking up from his book) Morning, Bean. \nThe GUARD sighs with boredom. He gets this from BEAN every day. As Bean moves on, he treads on the heel of a tourist's shoe. It comes off- BEAN moves on blithely. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY \nBEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The Virgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. There are silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work, listening to a female GALLERY GUIDE. \nBEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a coin. The coin drops and rolls into the special room. BEAN follows it into the darkness. \nGALLERY GUIDE \n(hushed) ... by Leonardo Da Vinci. As you can see, the special light in here goes some way to protect the drawing from photodisintegration caused by gamma ... \nThe camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. We hear the squeak of a tiny door open, then a click. The room is suddenly flooded in blazing white light. The onlookers gasp in horror. \nBEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin. As an afterthought he pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. He scuttles away. The GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation. CUT TO: INT. NATIONAL GALLERY. BOARDROOM - DAY \nGARETH Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell him. \nHUBERT Seconded.     We could all move to France. \nGEORGE All those in favour. \nThey all raise their hands wildly. \nLORD WALTON Come on - settle down everyone. CUT TO: INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    ELEVATOR - DAY \nBEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other       people. He gives himself a long squirt of breathfreshener. Then offers it to        the others, who politely refuse him. So he stands still again. Pause. BEAN          then smells something unpleasant. He leans and has a little sniff of the        person to his left. All right there. Then he sniffs to his right, and reels        at what he smells. He again takes out the breath freshener, and forces it       upon VINCENT, an elderly gentleman, who is mortified. \nAt this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the camera follows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters. He is another trustee. This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door. \nVINCENT I'm sorry I'm late. \nGARETH \nWhy can't we just give him the boot for crying out loud?! \nVINCENT Steady on, old man. I only ... \nGARETH Not you, you idiot. \nCUT TO: INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY \nBEAN, with cup of tea, walks along a corridor. He can't not interfere for tidiness sake. One empty room he switches off the light. Another he shuts the door. \nHe passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing in a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on. \nHe approaches the door to his office. A sign reads: 'STORAGE & CATALOGUE'. There is a huge padlock on the door. BEAN takes out a big key and enters his domain. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    STORAGE OFFICE - DAY. \nBEAN enters. He's been here for years and made it his own. It's an odd little world. There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and Airfix planes hang from the ceiling. Also a large cosy armchair and a T.V. \nA pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in. \nSUIT MAN Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life. Circa 1670. Can do? \nBEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him... \nHis office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet high and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings. At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts, modern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's like the giant storehouse    at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark. \nBEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners. \n", "test1_id": 1203, "test2_input": "KEVIN That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. \nDAVID Well, there is that ... \nKEVIN (TO BEAN ) I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers? \nBEAN Ahm.... \nCUT TO: \nINT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.   KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKEVIN is playing an adventure game: `GOBLINS 2' [This game exists.] The GOBLINS chuckle and make stupid noises that BEAN can imitate. A catchy piece of music accompanies the game. \nThe computer monitor shows the inside of the WIZARD's house. KEVIN moves the GOBLINS, and two little characters, FINGUS and WINKLE, around the room by clicking on areas in the room with his mouse. \nBEAN and KEVIN are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper. \nKEVIN It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2. \nBEAN is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little GOBLINS. He gets his delighted face right up to the screen. He sings along with the catchy tune. KEVIN is getting frustrated. \nKEVIN Come on, winkle. \nKEVIN clicks on a cuckoo clock in the WIZARD's room.       The cuckoo pops out holding a key in its beak. \nKEVIN It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo. \nBEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly clicks on the frog. \nBEAN Click, click, click, click, click ... \nThe frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.       KEVIN gets excited. \nKEVIN How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!! \nBEAN grins and makes WINKLE pick up the stone. Then he clicks through to inside the wizard's house. He makes WINKLE throw the stone at the cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak. \nKEVIN Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool! \nKEVIN slaps BEAN on the back.      BEAN is delighted.   Close on monitor, showing The Goblin game- \nCUT TO: \nINT.   LIVING ROOM.    DAY \nAnother game. JENNIFER'S Super Nintendo game on TV in the lounge area. It is a Gothic game where he-man types attack Vampires and bats with swords. \nDAVID is in the kitchen - setting out the roses in a vase.    The door opens - enter ALISON. Some tension. \nDAVID Hi, \nALISON Hi..... (PAUSE ) Roses. \nDAVID Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner that will kill you. \nALISON Great. ( SHE SETTLES A LITTLE ) You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you? \nDAVID Sort of half..... \nALISON Meaning? \nDAVID I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake. \nALISON Honestly David, you're so spineless. \nPause. Jennifer looks around.   She can't help but hear.   Not a happy experience. \nDAVID Roses.     Wine. \nHe is asking her for softness. Pause. At which moment BEAN enters wearing pointy hat. He helps himself to a melon from a bowl. He grins and exits. ALISON looks at DAVID sadly. \nALISON But no real change. \nAlmost instantly, BEAN is back. He rummages through a drawer and takes out some large elastic bands. And leaves. \nALISON I really do need some time on my own. Away from here. \nDAVID Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak. And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi. You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk. \nALISON Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk. \n", "test2_true": "DAVID and ALISON just stare. BEAN is followed by KEVIN who wears the same ears and teeth. \nDAVID Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer - could you turn that damn thing down. \nIt is quite loud. JENNIFER looks for the remote control. BEAN helpfully picks up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room. \nALISON No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ... \nToo late! BEAN punches a button and the lid of the CD player launches the Bambi into the air. \nDAVID sees it. In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it.         It smashes on the floor. \nBEAN raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts.        He thinks DAVID is a real Butter Fingers. \nJENNIFER, upset, has found the TV remote and unintentionally switches from the Vampire game to a TV channel. It's very loud. \nALISON gives DAVID a tearful look, and shakes her head. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE      NIGHT. \nA taxi drives away.      Alison is in it. CUT TO: \nINT.   HALLWAY- NIGHT. \nJENNIFER and KEVIN are in their night clothes. They sit with David on the stairs ~ still looking at the door-Alison left through. \nKEVIN I wish I    could use    that at school. \"Hey, Teach, no hard feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you around in    a couple    of years, maybe\". \nJENNIFER It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga. \nShe gets up and walks away. \nDAVID Jen - you don't wanna talk about it? \nJENNIFER It's you and Mom that need to talk. \nDAVID Sure.    You're right. \nKEVIN You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad? \nJENNIFER (FROM HER DOOR) Of course he is. \nKEVIN Are you? \nDAVID Yes, I am.    I must. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HALL/BEAN'S ROOM.   DAY. \nDAVID heads for Mr BEAN's room, and knocks cautiously on the door. \nBEAN (o. o. v) Enter. \nDAVID enters - Camera follows as DAVID finds his way through BEAN's washing hanging from strings across the room. BEAN is sticking things in a picture album. \nDAVID Hi, am I disturbing you? \nBEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question. \nDAVID May I? \nBEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a kid. Always standing on his own. \nPicture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16.    DAVID smiles.   BEAN mimes stupid disco dancing. \nDAVID turns another page. It is a sequence      of pictures of BEAN at famous UK locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street. They are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot. \nA whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on labels, going way back. \nThen a whole page of garden gnomes. \nDAVID None of your folks here - Family? \nBEAN starts to look for something in particular.      DAVID uses the pause to broach the awful subject. \nDAVID Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've been here twelve all... \nBEAN has    found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family that he    took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck next to    it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's anything    sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause. \n", "test2_id": 1204, "test3_input": "INT.   HOSPITAL.   RECEPTION - DAY \nMuch hustle and bustle. DAVID is getting directions from a nurse at the desk. He beckons to KEVIN and BEAN and strides, purposely towards a corridor. They hurry to catch him up, and Bean treat on the back of his shoe. DAVID turns and shouts at him. \nDAVID Just stay away from me!   D'you hear? \nHe takes KEVIN's hand and storms away round a corner. BEAN is taken aback not knowing what to do or where to go. He is really feeling sorrow now. He's shaken. All part of his slow coming to feel things properly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY \nDAVID and KEVIN turns a corner - and stop, frozen. There, sitting alone, on a bench, outside JENNIFER's room, is ALISON. She gets to her feet. Their eyes meet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY -DAY \nA crowd outside the gallery, look off camera. The camera follows BERNIE's gaze and takes in the modern car sculpture. Where there were two cars face down in the earth, there are now three, the new addition being Governor's pride and Joy. The three cars form a tall pyramid. \nClose on REYNOLDS' face. GRIERSON approaches. \nREYNOLDS Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass. \nGRIERSON nods - he's got the message. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR. DAY \nALISON and DAVID are standing where they were before, three paces apart. ALISON is upset, tired and drawn. \nALISON They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just kind of taking time out. (to Kevin) Hi, tough guy. (to David) It's a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while. \nA doctor passes \nDAVID Excuse me. \nDOCTOR 1 I'll be back in a minute. \nDAVID Okay, great. \nALISON looks at him. We don't quite read the expression but somewhere under there we know she's thinking \"yup, he's still ineffective.\" \nALISON At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you. \nDAVID Ah, well .... CUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - DAY \nBEAN is looking for his friends.        A doctor sweeps by him.   A nurse behind. \nNURSE Doctor Jacobson? \nDOCTOR JACOBSON Yes? \nNURSE We need you urgently in C Theatre. \nDOCTOR JACOBSON Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 .... \nNURSE It is urgent, sir. \nDOCTOR JACOBSON Okay..... \nThe doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he .goes.         BEAN sees it, picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.     RECEPTION - DAY \nELMER is at the busy reception desk and has been talking with a nurse. \nELMER No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now. \nELMER is obviously moved to find out about JENNIFER. He moves towards the exit ... He is surprised to see BUCK, the night-shift guard, dressed in civvies, sitting with outpatients. \nELMER Buck? \nBUCK looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room close-by. ELMER shakes his head and leaves. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "BEAN still following DR JACOBSON, who goes through more swing doors and then suddenly disappears. BEAN sees a big \"4\" above a door and goes in, holding the Stethoscope. A nurse accosts him instantly. She reads his name badge. \nNURSE 2 Doctor ... Bean? \nBEAN is fed up trying to correct people with this misconception. \nBEAN Actually ... (huge sigh) ... Yes, yes, yes... \nNURSE 2 Just in time, sir.     Allow me. \nShe immediately slips the white coat onto BEAN, and the gloves, and the mask. \nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY \nALISON, DAVID and KEVIN are sitting on the bench opposite JENNIFER's room. KEVIN picks up JENNIFER's SUPER NINTENDO console from the bench. DAVID notices this. ALISON answers his look. \nALISON When the Police told me what had happened I ... it's stupid I know ... but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to coma victims ... \nKEVIN Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee grinders? \nALISON That right.   So I went home and picked it up. \nDAVID Good thinking. (pause) You still call it 'home'. \nALISON looks at him seriously. \nINT.   OPERATING THEATRE.   NIGHT. \nInside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position. There are 3 attending nurses and an assistant doctor. They all look up to BEAN as he enters, fully kitted up. \nASSISTANT Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's severe inner bleeding along the abdomen. \nNURSE 2 He's coming round. \nASSISTANT Give him a T 70, straight away. \nThe victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time. It is the police officer, BRUTUS. He is in great pain. As the sedative shot goes in, BEAN takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. A look of total panic goes over BRUTU'S eyes, as he loses consciousness. \nASSISTANT Shall I do the cut, sir? \nBEAN nods - he's not going to argue with anyone. The assistant cuts. BEAN is horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. He can't believe this maniac has just cut through another personas flesh. \nASSISTANT I'm sorry. it's only MY first week. \nBEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily. \nNURSE I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support systems. \nEVERYONE turns to get on    with their particular jobs. BEAN is left with the body. A pause. He gets      a little bored. Takes a sweet packet out of his pocket. Only one sweet     left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he always does - throws it    up into the air, to catch it in his mouth. \nUnfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask.     It hits the middle of the mask and bounces into the cut in the body. \nBEAN looks down annoyed. Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy. So he puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers. ..Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. At which second the X-ray arrives. \nASSISTANT Here we go, doctor. ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is here - so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky. \nBEAN tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers. \nThey all applaud. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   HOSPITAL.    CORRIDOR - DAY. \nBEAN exits from the theatre - still in gown and mask, followed by the assistant. The police SIDE-KICK is waiting. \nSIDE-KICK Any news on the chief?. \nASSISTANT There certainly is.    Dr Bean here just saved his life. \nSIDE-KICK's eyes water. He's choked. BEAN shakes his hand nervously, and heads on fast before he's found out. He turns the corner and suddenly sees DAVID and ALISON, still seated. ALISON sees him. \nALISON 0 my god. \nDAVID Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along. \nALISON Nothing ever really changes, does it, David? \nShe turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone.       BEAN looks very contrite. At that moment, another doctor walks by. \nDAVID Excuse me. \n", "test3_id": 1205}

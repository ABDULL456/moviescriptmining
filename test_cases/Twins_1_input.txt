130   CONTINUED:    (A1)                                          130 JULIUS Vincent, we're twins.                                * 
Vince looks at his brother. VINCE (patronizing)                                 * I know this is a touchy subject                      * for you, Julius. But the fact is,                    * we don't look the same -- we don't                   * act the same, we don't talk the                      * same -- we don't dress the same.                     * JULIUS I know. 
VINCE (angry) So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.                             * JULIUS We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. Vince is starting to get interested again. VINCE Yeah? JULIUS And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that. 
Vince remembers. All the bravado about loving being an orphan has gone now. 
JULIUS You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes.

And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers. We won't be alone anymore, Vince. (a beat) We can be a family. Vince looks at his brother.      A beat. 
VINCE A family?   You really think so?

VINCE With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees... 
JULIUS ... and a real home where you'll always be welcome. VINCE Always? JULIUS Even when you've been bad. 
Vince begins to brighten. CUT TO:

132   INT. CLOTHING STORE (SANTA FE) - DAY                             132 As Vince ushers Julius through the door. JULIUS Is this necessary? VINCE I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes. 
A SALES CLERK approaches Vince. SALES CLERK Can I help you, sir?

133   EXT. CLOTHING STORE - LATER                               133 
As Vince and Julius emerge, dressed in identical outfits; each in his own way looks like a male model from an Italian fashion magazine. 
JULIUS Do I look okay? VINCE You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see                         * Frankenstein? JULIUS I read the book. VINCE That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white                   * guys.                                              * 
Julius doesn't have a clue. Vince dons sunglasses and demonstrates a soulful strut. 
VINCE Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on. 
Indicating glasses. Julius puts on sunglasses, snaps his fingers, tries to ape Vince's moves while Vince appraises him. 
JULIUS                               * Am I cool now? --                                  * VINCE                                 * Mr. Ice.                                           *

{"test1_input": "TIM Sorry. But you are, babygirl. (SINGS) You're my best friend. \nMILLIE Tss. Goofball. \nThe song ends. They sit quietly for a bit. \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Y'know Galen and Dar Krause just did a cruise to the Bahamas? Pretty reasonable they said, price-wise. \nTIM (mediocre Jamaican accent) Ya mon, Bahama-mama. \nMILLIE It's a little different I suppose-- a cruise. But... \nA beat, then Millie removes a cruise brochure from her purse. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Look, I'm not gonna shilly-shally around here, Tim. I found a river cruise through Germany-- Viking Line, real grade-A. It's what I want. For the honeymoon. \nTIM (SUDDENLY RATTLED) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait... Where's this coming from? We agreed on Wisconsin Dells for the honeymoon. It's what we agreed on. \nMILLIE You've been to the Dells two dozen times... \nTIM So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the Dells every year... \nMILLIE Because they have children. Water parks are for children... \nTIM Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky and Stage Show? It's not just a water park... \nMILLIE Timothy, settle. You've never even left the state of Wisconsin. Barely left Brown Valley... \nTIM What's so great about...? You're not... You're missing the... We agreed on the Dells. \nHe avoids eye contact. Millie takes Tim's chin in her hands, forcing him to look at her. \nMILLIE God rest her. Your mom was my best friend. But it's going on 20 years now. You gotta grow up. You gotta let go. You gotta live a life here. See? \nTIM I'm living a perfectly fine life. I don't know why you'd want to... (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM (CONT'D) rock the waters or whatever. Ridiculous. \nTim looks away again, pouting. Millie gives him a motherly hug. Over her shoulder, Tim watches a TEENAGER belting out QUE SERA, SERA on American Idol. Then, almost inaudibly: \nTIM (CONT'D) We agreed on the Dells. \nFADE OUT: \nIN BLACK, a phone RINGS. \nINT. TIM'S BEDROOM - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nTim sleeps alone in his twin bed. The phone rings again. Tim wakes with a start. He flips on the lamp, picks up the phone: \nTIM Hello... Oh, hey Bill... \nA look of profound anguish appears on Tim's face. \nTIM (CONT'D) Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No... \nThe sound of a church organ playing ON EAGLES WINGS fades in. \nINT. ST. ANSGAR'S LUTHERAN CHURCH - DAY \nIn back of a packed church, Millie whispers with WADE BRODT, 60, a bald, bullet-shaped man. The conversation is discreet. \nWADE Guy had it all. Everything you'd ever want. Y'know he flew a Cessna? In his spare time? \nMILLIE I always say people like that-- who live fast? They die hard. Look at River Phoenix. \nWADE Everything you'd ever want. \nMILLIE I just don't know. To do those things to yourself. Just perverted. (SIGH) Who ever heard of such a thing? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nCLOSE ON ROGER LEMKE'S CASKET \nRoger Lemke looks peaceful in death, although it's hard to miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt. Tim is at the front of a long line of uneasy MOURNERS. Tim holds back tears as he gently touches the marks on Lemke's neck. \nTim steps aside to greet the widow Gwen Lemke in a receiving line. The grief has left her gaunt. She appears medicated. \nTIM I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is-- was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He just... he had it all. If there's... \nHe is interrupted by Bill Krogstad's sobs. Tim reaches out to put a comforting hand on Gwen's shoulder, but somehow ends up touching her breast instead. A moment. \n", "test1_true": "Tim nods sadly as he removes his hand. He walks away. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY \nThe drab office is brightened with week-old funeral flowers and flaccid mylar sympathy balloons. \nTim sits across from a young couple, KURT & PAM GAMBSKY, 20s, in a small, glassed-in conference room. The couple is tense. \nPAM You just don't get it, Kurt... \nKURT Aw Christ, Pammy... \nTIM Hang on guys, how's this sound-- you can both be right. (pause for effect) I know you're probably thinking, \"Oh, an umbrella policy's only for rich people.\" You know what I say to that? Bull roar. \nThe Gambskys smile, comforted. Tim is good at his job. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM (CONT'D) Pam, Kurt-- I've known you guys since you were little kids. So let's don't think of me as an \"insurance salesman.\" Think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams... \nTim glances up and sees Bill Krogstad staring longingly at Northlands' three TWO DIAMOND Award plaques. A beat, then Krogstad SLAMS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WOOD PANELED WALL! The couple reels around upon hearing the sound. \nTIM (CONT'D) I'm... Excuse me a sec... \nTim exits the conference room and approaches Krogstad, whose hand is now bleeding. \nTIM (CONT'D) D'you-- can I get you a napkin or something, Bill? For that? \nBILL KROGSTAD Know how Roger used to get down there to Cedar Rapids? To the ASMI Convention? Any idea? \nTIM Um. I'm with Kurt and Pam Gambsky... \nBILL KROGSTAD Flew himself. In a Cessna. Pilot. (a mournful beat) It was all worked out. I was going to ease into retirement in July while Roger transitioned into his ownership role. \nTIM Wait, Roger was going to buy Northlands? \nBILL KROGSTAD All worked out. Shit, Dione already put the down payment on a time share. Branson, Black Hills. Florida. Units all over the place. \nTIM Holy cow. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nBILL KROGSTAD Yeah, whole deal. Now? Now I got my back up against Christ-knows-what. No Lemke, no buyer, the wife's spending like we won the goddamn Powerball. And what's worse, because of the way, y'know, the way Roger passed... \nKrogstad chokes up. His grief is very real. So is Tim's. \nTIM The... belt and the lederhosen...? \nBILL KROGSTAD (a nod, a sigh) Quote-unquote perverted, they're saying. Like Northlands has some kind of stain. Oh, I'm so goddamned tired... \nTIM Is there...? Can I do anything to help, or...? \nKrogstad hands Tim a Manila folder (bloodying it in the process). Tim gestures for his customers to hold tight. Tim opens the folder, reading aloud from a cover page. \nTIM (CONT'D) \"Innovations in Hog Farm Risk Mitigation.\" Roger's Two Diamond presentation for the ASMI Convention. I helped prepare it. \nBILL KROGSTAD We need those Two Diamonds more than ever, Tim. If I'm going to sell this company, we need people to feel OK about the Northlands brand. \nTIM (not getting it) Mm. \nBILL KROGSTAD I'd go myself but my daughter Kayla, the heavy one? She unearthed some Polack to marry her. I'm locked into that wedding over in Gladstone. No flex. Locked in. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM Whoa-whoa-wait. What are you saying? \nBILL KROGSTAD I'm not asking you to fill Roger Lemke's shoes. Not gonna happen. I'm asking you to deliver his presentation-- to bring me home those Two Diamonds. \nTIM I can't go to ASMI. To Iowa. To Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Why can't Lila do it? \nBILL KROGSTAD C'mon Tim. Lila's about as charismatic as a bag of hair. \nTIM Bill, I've never... I mean, I've dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation, but I'm no pro... \nTim is really starting to panic. \nBILL KROGSTAD You were what, 16, when I gave you that filing job? Right after your mom passed? Raising yourself pretty much, living all alone. And I'm thinking, now here's a kid. Here's a kid who's gonna go places. (a hand on Tim's shoulder) And then, somehow, you kind of just didn't. Now, I guess it makes some sense-- a child loses both parents at an early age, becomes what you might call stunted. But cripes almighty, do you want to just sit there in your folks old house, just rot away in Brown Valley dating that... (SUBTLY DISPARAGING) ... woman the rest of your life? \nTIM Millie and I are getting married. \nBILL KROGSTAD Tss, maybe three'll be a charm.

Long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of 70-foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice. \nTim and Joan run up to Orin, who is waiting by the silos. \nORIN OK guys, this is it. First team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match. (unfurls a scroll, reads) ASMI's past is behind us; But our future looks nice; Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century... by scaling this silo of ice! \nSome DUDES with ice climbing equipment-- ropes, picks, etc. appear. Tim looks petrified. Joan shakes her head. \nJOAN That doesn't even... There's no such thing as silo ice climbing. \nTIM No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa. ABC news did a story about it. I saw it on YouTube. \nJOAN Of course you did. Well, you can do it then... \nTIM Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared crapless of heights. \nJOAN You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz I'm not climbing jack. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJOAN (CONT'D) Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that... \nTim's nostrils flair. Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner arrive. Tim looks to the top of the silo. It is dizzyingly high. He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales. \nTIM Yeah. Let's do this thing. \nOrin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music (Whitesnake's HERE I GO AGAIN, perhaps). \nQUICK CUTS: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons. \nAnd they start climbing. Sort of. Tim jams his pick into the ice. He tries to pull himself up, but can't. Mike fares worse. He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice. \nTIM (CONT'D) Hang on... How's it...? \nMIKE PYLE Little help here... \nThe Dudes shout instructions. Tim and Mike try again. To no avail. Neither could do a pull-up if his life depended on it. \nA LITTLE WHILE LATER -- \nAll the contestants have shown up. But not a damn one of them can get more than a foot off the ground. \nTIM Ugh. This is frickin' hard. \nRONALD Really hard. \nDEAN I think I just shit my pants. \nJoan cheers. Orin looks to the Dudes, who shrug. \nA LITTLE WHILE LATER -- \nOrin talks on his cell phone, conferring. The contestants wait in a field, shivering. The sun is getting lower. Orin hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nORIN OK gang, that was Rick Martini with the National Chapter. Here's the deal. Since no one could do the final task, and since Joan and Tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. Unless anyone's got a problem with that? \nRonald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance. \nRONALD Dangit. You could've done better, Wilkes. \nTIM Wait, we won? \nORIN Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75 gift card for the Westdale Mall. \nOrin hands Joan the gift card. Despite the anticlimax, Tim is overjoyed. He picks up Joan and spins her around. Everyone else just wanders away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) - THAT EVENING \nTim is ebullient. Joan rides shotgun. The screen on Tim's phone says that he's missed 11 calls. It rings again. \nTIM Oh crap. I forgot... (ANSWERS PHONE) Hey, Millie. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) I have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours, Timothy. I was going to call the police. Where have you been? \nTIM I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! My teammate and I, that is. Joan. \nJOAN Hi Millie!

ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Lucky for us it came out naturally or we'd have been looking at surgery. \nTim pulls into a spot in the Westdale Mall parking lot.

MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMillie looks wounded. \nMILLIE So who's this Joan? \nEXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS \nTim gets out of the car. \nTIM Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with. Between you and me, she's a little different. Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar gift card, I'm not going to complain. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) You promised you'd check in with me. I'm very disappointed. \nTIM (PLAYFUL) OK, Mom... \nSilence. It's as though a profound revelation has just slipped out. As if, in an instant, everything has changed. \nINT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMillie's heart sinks. She looks at her Beanie Babies. \nMILLIE Well. You obviously have more important things to do than talk to me. My brother and I were just getting ready to go for fish at the Eagles anyhow. \nReveal: Wade is sitting in his rightful throne, watching an aerobics show on TV. Millie snaps at him. \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Go warm up the car, Wade. \nTIM (O.S. ON PHONE) Mil, I didn't... \nMILLIE It's fine. You'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, Tim.

OLIVE GARDEN, ROMANTIC BOOTH - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nTim and Joan are seated in a candlelit booth. Opera Muzak tinkles. If you didn't know this to be a mall-based chain, you might think it a romantic Italian restaurant. Maybe. \nAn acne-scarred WAITER, 21, approaches with a tray. \nWAITER Coors Lite for the madam.

But it won't break. Dean enters. \nDEAN That time of the month? (off Tim's look) C'mon man, it's gonna be OK. \nTIM No it's not. Nothing is OK. My job, my fianc\u00e9... (dawns on him) God, I'm a philanderer. I've let Bill down. I've let everybody down. \nDEAN C'mere, kiddo. Sit. Sit down. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDean leads Tim out of the bathroom. Tim sits on a desk chair. Dean sits on the edge of the desk. He looks fatherly. \nDEAN (CONT'D) My ex, Patti? Well-established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain, right? But like I say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- I'm the bad guy. `Cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home PREGNANT-- oh yeah, happy day in the Ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's the one planning the baby showers and taking Meg to the gyno, all that shit? The fucking Deanzie. That's who. \nTim stares at Dean for an incredulous moment. \nTIM Is this...? Why is this all of a sudden about you, Dean? \nDEAN I'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing. If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right. If not, fuck it. Life's way too short to lose sleep over shit that don't matter. \nTim slowly nods, surprised to find himself moved. \nINT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nOrin enthusiastically introduces a WOMAN in a smart pantsuit. \nORIN Without any more ado, our keynote speaker, Iowa Insurance Commissioner, Mrs. Susan Voss! \nThe room goes nuts. As Orin leaves the stage he spots Tim waiting in the wings. Tim gestures for Orin to come outside. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT.

I can't let him down. Please just let me compete. \nA moment. Orin nods, almost imperceptibly. \nINT. HOLIDOME ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER \nTim and Orin silently ride the elevator to the fourth floor. \nINT. THE TIFFANY SUITE - MOMENTS LATER \nOrin opens the door to the Tiffany Suite, a slightly larger version of the Junior Suite. He ushers Tim inside. \nORIN (self-deprecating, but proud) Tiffany Suite. Bit much. Perks of the Presidency, guess you'd say. Please. Have a seat on the davenport. \nTim sits. Orin goes to the mini-fridge, takes out a Sprite. \nORIN (CONT'D) Drink? \nTIM Ah, no. Thanks. \nORIN Suit yourself. \nOrin opens the Sprite, drinks. He reaches into a briefcase. He hands Tim a document with dozens of signatures on it. \n", "test3_true": "Tim shakes his head as he reads the names. \nORIN Between you and me-- this was a ploy by Mike Pyle. Trying to drive down the value of Northlands so he could get it on the cheap. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJust as Deanzie predicted. Orin snatches back the petition. He rips it in two. \nORIN (CONT'D) I just made that happen. Poof. Gone. Rainmaker. (makes rain gesture) Northlands keeps its three previous Two Diamond Awards. \nTIM Oh my gosh, really? Thank you. \nOrin sits next to Tim on the couch, closer than he needs to. \nORIN One thing Roger Lemke knew, Tim? He knew that when you get all dolled up, go to the prom-- the Big Dance-- that you gotta be prepared to put out. To show a little teat. (off Tim's confused look) You ever hear of PayPal, Tim? \nTIM PayPal? Um, yeah. I've used it to pay for Beanie Babies on E-Bay... (GUILTY) For my fianc\u00e9. \nORIN Good. Thing you gotta ask yourself now is this: \"Am I ready to dance? Am I ready to show a little TEAT?\" \nTIM I don't understand what you mean... \nORIN Calm down, Orin. I'm sorry. Please, let's talk E-Commerce for a minute. \nTim hesitantly follows Orin to the desk. A laptop sits open. \nORIN (CONT'D) Four years ago, the brain trust at ASMI National mandated we go \"on- line\" for everything. Billing, newsletter, the whole shebang. Now I'm almost 70-years-old-- I's about as likely to figure this deal out as I was to learn Chinese. Well, as you know Roger Lemke was a real whiz on the computer... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM You bet. \nORIN So Roger's up here looking over this new system, and he gets one of these lightbulb-going-off kinda looks, the way he did. And he says, \"Orin, with that newsletter going digital you're saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone. Four grand. Pure profit.\" You see where this is going, Tim? \nTIM I can't say that I do... \nORIN PayPal. That's where. What has ASMI ever given Orin Helgesson? Huh? Not dime one. Sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the National Board. Have I not been a good President? Do I not deserve a little something? \nTIM You're an awesome President... \nORIN You're GODDAMN right I am! \nOrin pounds his fist on the desk. Tim swallows hard. \nORIN (CONT'D) But I don't know the first blessed thing about this PayPal deal. Roger had the on-line know-how, not me. \nTIM I'm still not reading you here... \nORIN There aren't printing costs anymore, see? The ASMI-teer's digital. E- Commerce! Don't you get it, Tim? All that money-- almost 39-hundred dollars a year-- that goes into a PayPal account now. My PayPal account. But I've got no idea how to use it. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM Do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on-line, or...? \nORIN Your performance in that scavenger hunt was first-rate. Then I see you in the pool making love to that floozy, I realize maybe you've got a bit of Lemke's, shall we say, moral ambiguity. I need that. \nTIM You're talking about stealing. \nORIN Pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, Tim. Roger Lemke came to the prom. He showed me a little teat. I rewarded him with the Two Diamonds three years running. I'm prepared to do the same for you. What do you say? You take home those those Two Diamonds, Northlands' value skyrockets, Bill Krogstad retires to his time share. Everybody wins... \nWe push in on Tim-- at the crossroads of all crossroads. Outside, a clap of thunder booms ominously. \nTIM I'd be doing it for Northlands-- to keep it in Brown Valley and help my co-workers. To help Bill... \nTim looks away, avoiding eye contact. Then: \nTIM (CONT'D) What would you need me to do exactly...? \nOrin claps once, smiles like a proud grandparent. \nORIN OK, marvelous! \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE HORIZONS) - LATER \nDean has dozens of Hello My Name Is stickers with \"Deanzie For President!\" written on them. He forces one on a WOMAN.

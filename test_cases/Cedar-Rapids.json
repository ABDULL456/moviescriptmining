{"train": "CEDAR RAPIDS \nWritten by \nPhil Johnston \nDRAFT: June 12, 2009 \nFADE IN ON: \nA SHODDILY PRODUCED TV COMMERCIAL \nThe ad depicts videotaped scenes from Wisconsin's north country-- a farmer and a cow, a woman waterskiing, a guy mowing his lawn. A flat, nasally V.O. accompanies the images. \nROGER LEMKE (V.O.) The Brown River Valley: It's where we work. It's where we play. It's where we live. But even here in paradise, accidents can happen. \nThe ad wipes to an inappropriately gruesome photo of an obviously fatal car wreck. The NARRATOR is chroma-keyed over the image. He is ROGER LEMKE, 40, blandly charismatic, with a blonde moustache that evokes a low-rent Tom Selleck. \nROGER LEMKE (CONT'D) At Northlands Insurance, our goal is to provide high quality insurance services and related products to businesses and individuals in Wisconsin's Northlands. I'm Roger Lemke. Not only do I care about you, we also endeavor to give you the coverage you need at the best prices around. It's that reason Northlands has been awarded the prestigious Two Diamond Award from the American Society of Mutual Insurers three years running. Because at Northlands Insurance, we insure your dreams. \nThe car accident photo dissolves into a sunset. The treacly music crescendos and we: \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. NORTHLANDS INSURANCE - DAY \nThe ad has been playing on a 13-inch TV in a small, wood- paneled office. A handful of EMPLOYEES and FAMILY MEMBERS applaud wildly. The proud owner of Northlands, BILL KROGSTAD, 60, embraces the man of the hour, Roger Lemke. \nBILL KROGSTAD Ho-lee Christmas, knocked her outta the park, Roger! Out of the G-D park, you sonofagun! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nROGER LEMKE Hell, I'm just a pretty face, Bill. That copy was all you. Do got one little gripe though, boss-- if you'd waited until after Cedar Rapids we could've said winner of the Two Diamonds four years running! \nBILL KROGSTAD ROGER LEMKE Aroo-aroo! Two Diamonds! Two Diamonds! \nThe men roughhouse playfully. Roger's comely wife, GWEN, 30, holding their milk-fed TWIN TODDLERS, gives Roger a kiss. \nGWEN LEMKE So proud of you, Roggie. God, you rock. Doesn't your dad rock, boys?! \nROGER LEMKE (an Elvis impersonation) Thank you. Thank you very much! \nMore laughter and backslapping. After a bit, an as yet unseen MAN hesitantly approaches. He gently touches Roger's arm, not wanting to interrupt the revelry. Roger turns. \nROGER LEMKE (CONT'D) Tim! Timmy Lippe! Didn't even know you were here. You see it, bud? \nTIM (earnest, deeply admiring) Oh, heck yeah. You were awesome. \nDespite appearances to the contrary, this is our hero: TIM LIPPE (pronounced Lippy), 34, wholesome and positive, though undercurrents of desperation lurk just behind his kind eyes. \nTIM (CONT'D) Just super... super awesome. Man. \nROGER LEMKE Y'know what Tim, I want people to see the insurance game for what it really is-- it's a noble field. I believe that. Like I say, we're not just insuring vehicles and homes and that. Hell no. We're insuring people's dreams. \nTIM Oh. Yeah. I say that, too... sometimes. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nROGER LEMKE Well shit, you do, don't you? By god, I stole your line! Knew I'd heard that somewhere! \nTIM Oh, no biggie... \nROGER LEMKE Bummer they cut your little deal outta the ad, though. \nTIM Ach. Y'know. Got left on the ol'... \nA FEMALE CO-WORKER interrupts, accosts Roger and ignores Tim. \nFEMALE CO-WORKER Roger! Look out Brad Pitt! \nTIM The ol' cutting room floor, right? (upon being ignored) Brad Pitt. Ha. That's... (then, with forced nonchalance) Whoa. Cake. Cool. \nTim goes to the cake table. He smiles at the cake, impressed. \nTIM (CONT'D) So awesome. \nThe icing on the cake, a frosted visage of Roger Lemke, smiles back. \nINT./EXT. TIM'S CAR - DAY (LATE WINTER) \nA beige Buick Skylark splashes through a puddle of snow melt in the glum, isolated hamlet of Brown Valley, WI (pop: 337). \nTim bops his head and sings along as a Parliament song plays on a Good Times, Great Oldies radio station. A dour OLD LADY shoveling her driveway stares as he passes by. \nTIM Sorry. But you are, babygirl. (SINGS) You're my best friend. \nMILLIE Tss. Goofball. \nThe song ends. They sit quietly for a bit. \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Y'know Galen and Dar Krause just did a cruise to the Bahamas? Pretty reasonable they said, price-wise. \nTIM (mediocre Jamaican accent) Ya mon, Bahama-mama. \nMILLIE It's a little different I suppose-- a cruise. But... \nA beat, then Millie removes a cruise brochure from her purse. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Look, I'm not gonna shilly-shally around here, Tim. I found a river cruise through Germany-- Viking Line, real grade-A. It's what I want. For the honeymoon. \nTIM (SUDDENLY RATTLED) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait... Where's this coming from? We agreed on Wisconsin Dells for the honeymoon. It's what we agreed on. \nMILLIE You've been to the Dells two dozen times... \nTIM So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the Dells every year... \nMILLIE Because they have children. Water parks are for children... \nTIM Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky and Stage Show? It's not just a water park... \nMILLIE Timothy, settle. You've never even left the state of Wisconsin. Barely left Brown Valley... \nTIM What's so great about...? You're not... You're missing the... We agreed on the Dells. \nHe avoids eye contact. Millie takes Tim's chin in her hands, forcing him to look at her. \nMILLIE God rest her. Your mom was my best friend. But it's going on 20 years now. You gotta grow up. You gotta let go. You gotta live a life here. See? \nTIM I'm living a perfectly fine life. I don't know why you'd want to... (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM (CONT'D) rock the waters or whatever. Ridiculous. \nTim looks away again, pouting. Millie gives him a motherly hug. Over her shoulder, Tim watches a TEENAGER belting out QUE SERA, SERA on American Idol. Then, almost inaudibly: \nTIM (CONT'D) We agreed on the Dells. \nFADE OUT: \nIN BLACK, a phone RINGS. \nINT. TIM'S BEDROOM - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nTim sleeps alone in his twin bed. The phone rings again. Tim wakes with a start. He flips on the lamp, picks up the phone: \nTIM Hello... Oh, hey Bill... \nA look of profound anguish appears on Tim's face. \nTIM (CONT'D) Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No... \nThe sound of a church organ playing ON EAGLES WINGS fades in. \nINT. ST. ANSGAR'S LUTHERAN CHURCH - DAY \nIn back of a packed church, Millie whispers with WADE BRODT, 60, a bald, bullet-shaped man. The conversation is discreet. \nWADE Guy had it all. Everything you'd ever want. Y'know he flew a Cessna? In his spare time? \nMILLIE I always say people like that-- who live fast? They die hard. Look at River Phoenix. \nWADE Everything you'd ever want. \nMILLIE I just don't know. To do those things to yourself. Just perverted. (SIGH) Who ever heard of such a thing? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nCLOSE ON ROGER LEMKE'S CASKET \nRoger Lemke looks peaceful in death, although it's hard to miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt. Tim is at the front of a long line of uneasy MOURNERS. Tim holds back tears as he gently touches the marks on Lemke's neck. \nTim steps aside to greet the widow Gwen Lemke in a receiving line. The grief has left her gaunt. She appears medicated. \nTIM I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is-- was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He just... he had it all. If there's... \nHe is interrupted by Bill Krogstad's sobs. Tim reaches out to put a comforting hand on Gwen's shoulder, but somehow ends up touching her breast instead. A moment. \nBILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) Point is, I'm not exactly dancing in the streets here Tim, but it's a perception thing. You go down there to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie- eyed and all that. You show them that Northlands is a good outfit-- an upstanding Christian outfit... \nTim considers the gravity of this moment. \nBILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) Aw cripes, say you'll do it. \nKrogstad starts crying again. He hugs Tim, his bloody hand staining Tim's canary yellow V-neck sweater. Tim looks up to see the Gambskys in the conference room staring at him. \nMONTAGE -- \nA melancholic yet uplifting song (Leonard Cohen's HALLELUJAH, perhaps) plays as: \n- Tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder. He looks at the barren trees as he considers his fate. \n- Tim Googles \"Cedar Rapids.\" He looks at photos, crime statistics, a Chamber of Commerce Youtube video. He closes his eyes, exhales. \n- Tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror. He works late. He types. He Power Points. Krogstad critiques. \n- Tim laminates maps of Cedar Rapids and area attractions. \n- Tim pulls a dusty American Tourister suitcase from the attic. It looks about 40 years old. He packs. \nINT./EXT. TIM'S BUICK SKYLARK - MORNING \nTim looks pensive as he drives. He's wearing a new suit. It's a little too big. A greeting card and a Beanie Baby Rooster bounce along on the passenger's seat. \nTim pulls up to a SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE. A pick-up truck with the words Brodt Heating & Cooling is parked in the driveway. \nINT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTim pokes his head into a living room, surprised to see Wade, the 60-ish bald guy from church, reclining on a Lazy Boy. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nWade's boots are off. His socks are dirty. He's watching ESPN on a TV with an Olan-Mills portrait of Tim & Millie atop it. \nWADE Oh, hiya Tim. \nTIM Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...? \nMillie enters in a terry cloth robe. A Yorkshire Terrier follows her. Millie acts nonchalant. So does the dog. \nMILLIE Hi Tim. (re. Wade's presence) Wade's cable's down. \nTIM It's six AM...? \nWADE Mike & Mike in the Morning. ESPN 2. \nTIM Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha. \nWADE Mm. \nTIM (finally, to Millie) Well I just wanted to... \nHe displays the Beanie Baby and the card. She takes them with a cold smile. Tim notices an identical stuffed rooster on an oak bookshelf-- home to over 155 other Beanie Babies. \nTIM (CONT'D) Oh shoot. You already have a Strut the Rooster... \nMILLIE So this is it then? (TO WADE) Tim's jetting off to Cedar Rapids this morning, Wade. Big deal insurance convention. Iowa. \nWADE That right? \nTIM It's only four days. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nMILLIE Won't go to Germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like Tom Petty or one of them? \nTIM (TO WADE) We agreed on the Dells... (then, to Millie) Should we maybe talk in the...? \nWADE Oh it don't bother me. \nTim tries to proceed as if Wade weren't sitting there. \nTIM If I don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil. There are four other employees whose lives are on the line. Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work. So. \nMILLIE It's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on. \nTIM No, Bill said he'd make that part of any deal... \nMILLIE Believe you me, Bill Krogstad is looking out for one guy. And that's Bill Krogstad. \nWADE (OVERTLY DISPARAGING) Krogstad. \nBILL KROGSTAD Said it before, I'll say it again: Your job, the office in Brown Valley-- all safe. What you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. That's all you need to worry about. \nTim swallows hard. Bill brings it in for a hug and inhales Tim's hair. \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nTim has a window seat. He reads the safety card. He's sweaty, anxious. A vaguely swarthy MAN (Indian? Italian? Hard to tell.), 40s, sits next to him. A perky FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT You lucky ducks are obviously seated in an exit row. Score! (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D) Just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation... \nThe man smiles nonchalantly. Tim tries to play it cool. \nTIM You're talking what, water landing? (looks around, whispers) Terror type deal? Terrorists...? \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT It's really just a formality. \nTIM Believe it or not, I have actually never been on an airplane before. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Oh, well you'll do awesome. \nTIM (takes a moment) OK. If you need any help, I'm in. \nThe flight attendant smiles politely, if confusedly. \nTHE PLANE TAKES OFF \nTim looks out the window, watching nervously as the dairy farms and frozen lakes of northern Wisconsin recede. He instinctively turns to his neighbor. \nTIM Tim Lippe. \nMAN Ah. David Marinakis. \nThey shake hands. \nTIM Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis? \nDAVID MARINAKIS Greek. It's Greek. \nTIM Marinakis. OK. Mine's German. Lippe. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM (CONT'D) As in, \"Don't you get lippy with me, mister.\" My grandma used to say that. Before she passed. Lot of people pronounce it lip. Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh. \nDavid Marinakis nods, goes back to his book, seemingly shutting down the conversation. Tim settles in. \nTHE PLANE LANDS -- \nTim hesitates before stepping onto the jetway-- one small step for man-- and just like that, he's in IOWA! \nINT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY \nTim helps David Marinakis take his bag off the carousel. \nTIM Like I say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance. \nDAVID MARINAKIS It's a good way of looking at it. \nTIM I think so. \nTim hands David his card, who takes it with a genuine smile. \nTIM (CONT'D) Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me. \nDAVID MARINAKIS Will do, Tim. Thanks. \nDavid exits. Tim stands there waving. \nEXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE - DAY \nTim emerges from an elevator on the roof of a parking garage. He inhales the chilly Iowa air. He glances at his rental agreement and spots his car, a red Chevy Cobalt. \nTIM Hello. Score! \nAs he approaches the car, he stops. He chuckles, in awe. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM (CONT'D) Holy crap. Awesome. \nIn the distance, the Cedar Rapids skyline looms-- its tallest building, the Alliant Tower stretching 21 stories into the cloudy sky. Tim snaps a photo with his cell phone. \nBLACK MAN Are you Tim? Tim Lippe? \nTim just smiles a wide, deer-in-headlights smile. \nBLACK MAN (CONT'D) I'm Ronald Wilkes. Bill Krogstad said we were gonna be roommates? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD WILKES, 45, is conservative in dress and demeanor. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Tim! Tim! Tiiim! \nTIM (INTO PHONE) Let me call you back, Mil. \nTim clicks off his phone, just stares at Ronald. \nRONALD You are Tim...? \nTIM Um. Yeah. Yes. You bet. For a minute there I was like, whoa, I'm gonna be robbed here, or... \nTim laughs loudly. Ronald just looks at Tim. A beat. \nTIM (CONT'D) It's super... just super great to meet you, Ronald. \nTim shakes Ronald's hand, holds onto it for at least two seconds too long. \nRONALD OK. You want to check out the room then? \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nRonald leads Tim into the room, a junior suite with two beds, a kitchenette and a couch in the separate living room area. \nTIM Check out these digs. Huzzah! \nRONALD Yeah, you could do a lot worse. (a serious beat) Look Tim, I gotta put the cards on the table here. The reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked-- wedding or some such. Point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. Now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD (CONT'D) But if you've got any qualms, I hear you L & C, that's Loud & Clear. \nRonald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once. To Tim, however, he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity. \nTIM No. I'm down. Down with that. Heck yeah. Any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise? \nRONALD No. Just hope he doesn't snore. \nTIM (LAUGHS BOISTEROUSLY) Can you imagine? Or someone who has terrible gas?! Like, pull my finger. Brrump! Hello, no thanks! \nTim is giddy like a kid away at camp for the first time. \nRONALD This isn't Woodstock, Tim. It's a regional insurance convention. Whoever it is, I'm sure he'll be a straight shooter. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nA pair of massive, scuffed wing-tips walk determinedly down the hall. We don't see the man they belong to, but we most definitely hear him as he passes various CONVENTION GOERS. \nMAN (O.S.) Hey Taco Bill, am I gonna see you at Horizons tonight? I hear they got their all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet going! \nA booming laugh follows as the feet continue down the hall. \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nTim admires Ronald's laptop. The screen saver is a photo of a billboard advertising Ronald Wilkes Insurance. A picture of a stoic-looking Ronald is the centerpiece of the billboard along with the slogan, Your Insurance Professional. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD So far it's just the one billboard north of St. Cloud. Course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the Twin Cities corridor, but at the end of the day, it's N-T- S. Not Too Shabby. \nTIM Ha. N-T-S. That's hilarious. I'd love to own my own agency... \nThe door bursts open. We boom up from the scuffed wing-tips to reveal DEAN ZIEGLER, 45, whose massive personality just barely hides an undercurrent of sadness and insecurity. \nDEAN Baroo-baroo, let's get this party started you mother-rubbers! \nRonald deflates upon seeing Dean. He clearly knows him. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Ronald Wilkes! No fucking way! The Ronimal! Gimme some love-uh, my soul broth-uh! \nDean gives Ronald a bear hug, lifts him off the ground. \nRONALD Turn down the volume, Ziegler. You just got here, for Pete's sake. \nTim looks like someone deciding which direction to run from an oncoming tornado. Dean notices Tim's look. \nOrin places a 4 x 6 foot poster of Roger Lemke on an easel. A period of mournful reflection follows. Until Orin breaks out in song-- WERE YOU THERE?, a somber hymn. \nORIN (CONT'D) Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they crucified my Lord? \nTim looks around nervously as the entire room joins in song. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME, HALLWAY - A SHORT WHILE LATER \nTim paces, cell phone to his ear. \nTIM I need to talk to you, Mil. I'm in over my head here. I feel like I can't even swim. It was fun at first, but now it's like, I dunno. I need you so bad, babygirl... \nA man's voice picks up on the other end. \nWADE (O.S. ON PHONE) Millie's in the john. \nTIM Who's...? Wade? \nWADE (O.S. ON PHONE) You bet. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM Are...? You're at Millie's still? \nWADE (O.S. ON PHONE) Badger hockey's on. My cable's out. (SILENCE) You want her to give you a ring when she's off the john? \nTIM Um. Yes, please. And just, would you tell her I love her very much. \nWADE (O.S.) You got it, bud. \nTim shuts his eyes for a moment-- be strong. Be strong. \nINT. HOLIDOME FITNESS CENTER - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nTim, in shorts, tube socks and a very old Milwaukee Bucks tank top, reads the diagram for the chest press machine. He gives it a try, lifting about 50 pounds. The only other person in the room is a WOMAN, 37, on a treadmill. \nTim glances her way, and by chance they make eye contact in the mirror. She smirks. He immediately looks at the floor. We stay on Tim, lifting weights, eyes to the ground. But we hear the treadmill stop. Finally, Tim looks up to find: \nWOMAN You were checking me out. \nMortified, Tim drops the weights. They crash to their base. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) I'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women. \nTIM I... Ma'am, no. I'm sorry if you... I wouldn't... I have a fianc\u00e9! \nWOMAN Unbelievable. That poor woman should know what you're up to. \nTIM No, no, no, please. I didn't... \nThe woman can't keep it in. She starts laughing. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nWOMAN I am so sorry. I'm totally messing with you. God, I'm a jerk. \nTIM Ha. OK. That was different. Ha. Yes. Yes you are. A real... jerkhead. \nWOMAN I'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox. \nJOAN OSTROWSKI-FOX, middle-management sexy, if slightly too tan, puts out her hand. Tim shakes it. \nTIM Tim Lippe. \nJOAN Don't get lippy with me, mister. \nWhoa. Tim is taken aback by this. Joan notices Tim's outfit. \nJOAN (CONT'D) So do you play professional basketball, Tim? Because that's a pretty updated uniform there. \nTIM No I don't. I'm actually in town for the ASMI convention. \nJOAN Oh, is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word \"gullible\" in a dictionary? \nTIM No, it's an association of insur... Oh. You're screwing with me again. \nJOAN Indeed I am. I'm here for ASMI, too. In from Oh-my-god, Nebraska. Just kidding-- Omaha. (wipes off some sweat) Ugh, I am gross, so I'm going to bid you farewell, Tim Lippe. See you at Horizons tonight? \nTIM Um. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJOAN Unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower. \nDEAN (CONT'D) (re. the bartender) Kid was in the navy. Seaman. \nDean nudges Tim and laughs as the BARTENDER, 25, approaches. \nBARTENDER What can I getcha? \nTIM Ah. Do you guys have root beer? \nDEAN You want a nipple with that? \nTIM Ah, why would I need a nipple...? \nDEAN Ach, I'm busting your balls. You don't get out much, do you buddy? (spots Tim's drink coupons) Whoa, who'd you have to blow to get all those? \nTIM I didn't... Nobody. President Helgesson gave them to me. \nDEAN Smug fuck. Trying to poison my roommate with his B-S propaganda. \nTIM I really don't... Orin, President Helgesson, he wanted to help me meet people. Just being friendly. \nDEAN (softens, fatherly) Wow-wow-wow, you are na\u00efve. A rail cocktail's, what, four bucks? Times that by 10 drink coupons. We're talking 40 large, Tim. Doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it? Sounds more like one of these I-scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals. (off Tim's confused look) I bet ol' Orin invited you up to the Tiffany Suite, too, hmm? Fourth floor? View of the pool? Yup. (leans in, conspiratorial) Cocksucker's buying your vote, pal. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTim shudders. Dean gestures for Tim to act natural as Ronald enters with a taciturn Latino man, BILL HERNANDEZ. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Ronimal! Taco Bill! Over here! (TO TIM) Bill Hernandez. I call him Taco Bill. Mexican. \nLATER -- \nLubricated INSURANCE WORKERS are now singing karaoke. Orin and Mike Pyle, the sweater vest guy, sit at a table in back. Orin looks at Tim with concern as Dean regales him. \nDEAN So Big Time Tim, what're you looking for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids? \nTIM Ah, that would be nothing... \nTim displays a photo of Millie (a portrait from the junior high where she teaches) in his wallet. \nDEAN That your mom? \nTIM No. No it is not. Millie and I are engaged. To be married. \nRONALD You're married yourself, Ziegler. The heck's your moral compass? \nDEAN My moral compass is pointing true north, if you read me. Right Taco Bill? \nTaco Bill sighs and wanders off to get a drink. \nDEAN (CONT'D) And by the way, Ronimal-- I was married. Was. \nRONALD Oh jeez. You and Patti split? Sorry to hear that. \nDEAN (barely covering the pain) Ah, she's a fucking asshole. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDEAN (CONT'D) Together 17 years. Lucky if one of `em was decent. ASS. FUCKING. HOLE. \nIt's a weird moment. Dean takes a drink, laughs it off. \nDEAN (CONT'D) What I was talking about anyway, Ronimal, is that from what I can deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has led a-- shall I say-- sheltered existence. And I think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo! \nDean raises his drink heroically. No one else joins him. \nRONALD ASMI isn't a vacation for everybody, Dean. End of the day, Tim's here to work and to win. For his agency. \nTIM Exactly. And P-S, I would never, ever have \"relations\" or whatever with another woman. \nAs fate-- that wily minx-- would have it... \nJOAN (O.S.) Hubba-hubba, check out these studs. \nIt's Joan Ostrowski-Fox, the woman Tim met in the gym. Dean and Ronald get up, greet her warmly. Tim looks at his soda. \nRONALD Joan Ostrowski-Fox. \nDEAN The O-Fox! \nJoan does an ironic, flirtatious curtsy. \nJOAN Here she is, Miss America. \nRONALD You fly in from Omaha, Joan? \nBILL KROGSTAD Oh cripes, you know as well as I do that Polack's gonna head for the hills the second he gets his papers. But no, you want to end up in the poor house, Dione, we'll go. Let's just keep on cashing checks we don't have... \nDIONE KROGSTAD We are going to our daughter's wedding, Bill. \nINT. HOLIDOME LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nTim deflates, actually fighting back tears. \nTIM I didn't know I did anything wrong. \nBILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE) Well you better try doing something right, Lippe. Because if you keep lousing up, we all by god starve! And don't you tell me to calm down Dione! \nKrogstad hangs up. Rattled, Tim hurries for the exit. He gets in the revolving door when he spots Joan Ostrowski-Fox outside having a cigarette. Rather than face her, Tim keeps going in the revolving door. But she sees him and waves. \nEXT. HOLIDOME - CONTINUOUS \nTim does one more turn in the revolving door and steps out. \nJOAN I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care for a Virginia Slim, Lippe? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTim just shakes his head, unable to hide his despondence. \nJOAN (CONT'D) Whoa, what's wrong? \nTIM Mm, I don't know. Only everything. \nJoan gives him a kind, gentle smile. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEDAR RAPIDS PARK - DAY (A LITTLE WHILE LATER) \nTim and Joan swing on a swing set in a dreary little park overlooking the Cedar River. It is a cold, gray day. \nTIM He didn't have to yell at me. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm trying my hardest. \nJOAN D'you want me to kick his butt? \nTIM Could you? \nJOAN Absolutely. I know Krogstad. I could take him. `Sides, I'm a ninja. A nin- jette, actually. Hoo-waaaah! (TIM CHUCKLES) So Lippe, how'd you end up in the insurance game? God that sounded dorky-- insurance game. (does 40s-style Cagney) Look here, see, how'd you end up in the insurance game, see...? \nTIM You are freaky. (laughs, then) No, it's kind of weird how I got interested in insurance, actually. When I was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident. \nJOAN Oh my God. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM Yeah. Not good. But after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. And we were. (BEAT) The crazy thing-- our agent was actually Bill Krogstad. \nJOAN No way. Really? \nTIM He had just opened Northlands. Anyway, I remember thinking, this guy's a hero. A real hero. So even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now-- I'll never forget that. \nTim jumps off the swing, taking care not to slip in the snow. Joan jumps off. They walk toward the river, silent for a bit. \nTIM (CONT'D) This river-- the Cedar River? It flooded the whole city a couple years ago. \nJOAN I remember that. Massive disaster. \nTIM People talk about the firemen and policemen and that. But think about all the claims in a disaster like that-- how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. We're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. And claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. I'm telling you, it's a noble calling. I really believe that. \nJOAN You realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? You are a hero, Lippe. \nTIM Tss. I wish. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJOAN No, I can tell. You're the Superman type. Kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. They'd call you Insurance Man-- put a big red \"I\" on your chest... \nTIM Well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway. \nJOAN Well, you're welcome. (THEN) So can you fly me back to the hotel, Insurance Man? I'm freezing my arse off. \nHe laughs, sufficiently cheered up. She snaps her fingers and starts heading back. \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - DAY \nDean and Orin argue. Ronald tries to stay out of it. \nDEAN I'm saying a Bridge to the 22nd Century is a stupid theme, Helgesson. Not a goddamn one of us is even going to be alive in the 22nd Century... \nORIN Oh, and I suppose under a Dean Ziegler administration, we'd just abandon E-Commerce and all that, huh? What's your take, Ronald? \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nTim sits on his cot. He is on his cell phone. \nTIM I just wanted to hear your voice. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Brandy, no! Bad girl! Sorry, she's giving me grief over this new wet food. What did you need now, Tim? \nTIM Nothing. Nothing really... \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Well I for one feel like I ought to be on the fire department, I'm putting out so many fires. Lucy Kofnetka asked me to do altar guild for her. Again. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM Oh. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Patti told me Lucy's seeing some guy who doesn't even go to church, so she apparently feels no need to maintain her responsibil... Brandy! No! She's going number two on the floor! No! You get outside! I'll call you later, Tim... \nHe hangs up. He exhales. He looks out the window: An Applebee's. A Super Target. Traffic on the distant interstate. \nSomething is bubbling in Tim-- maybe not cauldron of lava; more like a cup of soup left in the microwave a bit too long. But still, there's a boiling, churning glow behind his eyes. \nINT. NOTTINGHAM BANQUET ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTim determinedly enters a banquet room where VENDORS have set up booths. He approaches a WOMAN at a table with a sign that says Met Life Scavenger Hunt! \nTIM I'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt. \nWOMAN Super. Teaming with a co-worker or are you in need of a partner? (off Tim's look) This is a team event, like the Amazing Race. On TV? But instead of going around the world, you look for stuff in Cedar Rapids. And instead of a million dollars, the winning team gets a $75 gift card for Westdale, which is... \nTIM Eastern Iowa's largest two-story mall. I know. Sweet. (a thought, a moment) And yes, I do have a teammate. \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM) - DAY \nRonald and Joan exit the Seminar. They spot Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD Everything OK? \nJOAN Yeah, what was that call? \nTIM Oh, nothing. Say Joan, you have something on your blouse. \nJoan looks down at her blouse. Tim flicks her chin. \nTIM (CONT'D) Burn. \nJOAN (LAUGHS) You are very weird... \nTIM (bad Elvis impersonation) Thank you. Thank you very much. (AWKWARD) So, ah, I signed you up for the Scavenger Hunt. To be my teammate. In the Scavenger Hunt. \nJOAN Really? Why? \nTIM Uh, well I... Because Ronald already had a teammate... \nRONALD Bill Hernandez? \nJOAN Taco Bill. \nTIM ... And I thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team. So... (then, firm) I think you should do it. \nJOAN Heck yeah! I get to be Insurance Man's sidekick. We're going to kick some ASS! \nA few PEOPLE look curiously at Joan. Tim stands up a bit straighter. This is good. This is good. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nOrin, in a theme-appropriate safari hat, addresses the 10 TEAMS. Among them: Tim & Joan, Ronald & Taco Bill, Mike Pyle & a FRIZZY-HAIRED WOMAN. Dean is absent. \nORIN Like last year there'll be a few physical challenges... \nTIM (TO JOAN) I am super pumped! \nJOAN (WHISPERS) Whoo-hoo. \nORIN Course this should be considered a fun event, in the spirit of team building. You can find your first clue \"under the sea.\" By which I mean in the pool area. So ready, set, race! \nAs the teams take off for the pool, Dean enters. Tim pauses long enough to say: \nTIM You're going down, a-hole. \nJust then, Dean's partner, a MAN in an electric wheelchair, PERRY KUHN, 29, rolls in. They high five and whoo-hoo. \nTIM Nice. Thanks. \nThe waiter exits. Tim raises his glass for a toast. \nTIM (CONT'D) To victory. To new friends. To life. And all the joys of living it. \nJOAN That's really nice. Cheers. \nThey clink glasses. Tim takes a dainty sip of his sherry. \nTIM Mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. Awesome. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nLATER -- \nJoan feeds Tim a bite of her lasagna. A bit sticks to his chin. She wipes it off, semi-seductively. Tim laughs. \nJOAN So Lippe, I'm trying to figure you out. Hopes, dreams, aspirations, blah-blah-blah? Whaddaya got? \nTIM Mine? Let's see. Um. I would love-- some day-- to put a little greenhouse in my backyard. \nJOAN Dream the impossible dream... \nTIM No, I've actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at Fleet Farm that won't break the bank... \nJOAN C'mon, man. I mean fantasy-land stuff. What do you really want? \nA beat. He takes a sip of sherry, shrugs. \nTIM Well. I always hoped I could take over Northlands when Bill retired. But that obviously isn't going to happen now. \nJOAN Oh, screw him. He wants to sell, why don't you just buy Northlands? \nTIM Yeah right. \nJOAN Why not? You could get a loan. \nTIM I don't... Probably not. \nJOAN You know the business. You know the clients. You actually care about your job. You'd be perfect. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM Grrrr. Ha. Time out. Sheesh. Let's. (BEAT) OK. What I'd really like is a family. To be a dad. So kids, I guess, that's what I really want. \nJOAN Yeah well, you can have mine. \nTIM You've got kids? \nJoan takes out her Blackberry. The screensaver is a family portrait: Joan, a MAN with a goatee, and TWO CUTE KIDS. All of them are dressed in denim. \nJOAN Tyler's ten. Ashley'll be eight next month. My little squirrels. \nTIM Awesome. Beautiful kids. And that's...? \nJOAN My hubby. Rich Fox. Richie. We met when we were both Rotary exchange students in high school. Lived in Norway for a semester. \nTIM Norway. \nJOAN I was such a spaz. Band geek, total ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the whole nine. I didn't even get boobs until college. Anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year. Then kids. Then blah-blah-blah, and here we are. Richie's a Supervisor in the Parks Department now. For the County. \nTIM Wow. \nTim doesn't hide his shock well. Joan sees it. \nJOAN I know it's effed up. And if I had it all to do over again, I don't know what I'd choose. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJOAN (CONT'D) But I don't have that option. So this is my fantasy-land, Tim. Cedar Rapids. ASMI. This. I come here, and for a few days I'm someone else. No kids. No husband. No responsibility. Wild woman. (an ironic growl) Sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what I mean, Lippe? \nTim nods but looks more confused than ever. \nINT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT \nTim drives. The Olive Garden doggie bag sits in Joan's lap. Silence, other than the radio. After a bit: \nTIM OK. I thought of another one. \nJOAN One what? \nTIM Wish. Or dream or whatever. It's still small potatoes compared to... \nJOAN No, let's hear it... \nTIM (titters as he figures it out) Dick head. Yeah Dean, you are a total Richard! \nDEAN Ha! I love it! Richard head! \nTim high fives Ronald. Joan returns, sits next to Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD To Tim-- the young rookie comes in, takes the scavenger hunt. That right there is P-T. Prime Time. \nThey all drink to that. \nA BIT LATER -- \nTim has finished his sherry. The bartender pours a second glass. Tim wears the shit-eating grin of a first-time drunk. \nDEAN Would you rather toss a bum's salad, y'know, eat out his butthole or... give your dad a B-J? \nRONALD Come on Ziegler, this is supposed to be a clean game... \nTIM No, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad. Thousand Island! \nTim laughs hysterically. Which makes everyone else laugh. \nJOAN Shots! (to the bartender) Kamikazes, good sir. \nKARAOKE DJ (O.S.) OK. We're ready for Tim Lip to rock the mic. Is there a Tim Lip? \nTIM Did he just...? \nJOAN Why wait for the church choir when you can take care of one of your dreams right now, dude? \nTIM No, no, no, no, no... \nThe bartender pours the shots. Joan whispers to Tim. \nJOAN I know you can do it, Lippe. Go be my hero-- Insurance Man. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nKARAOKE DJ Tim Lip? You in the house? \nJoan passes Tim the shot. He slams it. The room applauds as Tim nervously makes his way to the stage. \nTim confers with the DJ. The DJ nods, cues up the song. Tim gives Joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic. \nTIM I, um, I've met some really, just super neat people here. But this song, I'd like to dedicate to the first African-American person I've ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander-- said hello and that. But... Anyway, I just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes! \nTim gives Ronald a thumbs-up. Ronald returns the gesture as the opening bars of Clarence Carter's PATCHES kick in. [NOTE: Patches is an EXTREMELY sentimental soul song about a poor black kid named Patches.] The first verse is spoken word. \nTIM (CONT'D) (reading off the screen) I was born and raised down in Alabama. On a farm way back up in the woods. I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches. Papa used to tease me about it. But deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could. \nJoan and Dean whoo-hoo! \nTIM (CONT'D) (breaks into song, very soulful) My papa was a great old man. I can see him with a shovel in his hands. See education he never had; He did wonders when the times got bad. The little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made. \nJoan and Dean rush to the dance floor. Ronald remains on his bar stool but bops his head politely. Tim tears it up. Patches continues, creating a: \nMUSIC BED OVER: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nA SERIES OF SHOTS -- \n- Tim drinks more sherry. The gang laughs, having a blast. \n- Ronald tries to excuse himself. \nRONALD The presentation's in 36 hours. I can't afford to be off my game. Frankly, neither can you, Tim. \nTim responds by giving Ronald a noogie. Everyone laughs. \n- Joan, Dean and Ronald roam the Holidome halls. Tim jumps out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at Dean. Dean takes off running after Tim. Joan and Ronald follow. \n- The song fades out as the four of them approach the Pool Area. The sign on the pool door says, Hours 8 AM - 11 PM. \nRONALD (CONT'D) This is ridiculous, you guys. Told you, it closed an hour ago. \nTim tries the door. It's open. Dean and Joan go in. Tim and Ronald stay in the hall. \nRONALD (CONT'D) Tim. Come on. This isn't you. \nTIM Uh-oh. Who is it then? \nRONALD You know what I mean. We've both worked our tails off. Why poop it away on... \nJoan, still topless, leads Tim by the hand as they sprint toward her room. They run past a SECURITY GUARD along the way. [Note: Tim still has a conspicuous erection.] \nINT. JOAN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThey burst into Joan's room, laughing to the point of tears. \nTIM Holy crap! We're so dead! \nThen Joan mauls Tim. She tackles him to her bed. He rolls on top of her. A primal, guttural howl erupts from Tim. Then: \nTIM (CONT'D) I want to make love! \nIt's on. \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - NIGHT (A LITTLE WHILE LATER) \nDean pounds on the door to the Junior Suite. \nDEAN Come on, Ronimal! My key got wet. Wake up, man! (NO RESPONSE) Ah, fuck it. \nDean lumbers away, leaving puddles of water in his wake. \nINT. JOAN'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nPost-sex. Tim lies in bed, beatific. Joan, now wearing glasses and conservative PJ's, comes out of the bathroom. \nTIM Your body's just so... firm and pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was just super... super awesome. \nJoan just smiles as she gets into bed. \nTIM (CONT'D) Wanna cuddle? \nJOAN Cuddle? Um. OK. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM I love to cuddle. (NUZZLES) You're special, Joan. So special... \nJoan awkwardly pats Tim on the head as he drifts to sleep. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. JOAN'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nJoan is talking on the phone with her son. Her demeanor is entirely different-- a tone and physicality we've not seen. \nJOAN No baby, you guys are playing at Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next week... (LISTENS) Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna miss it. It's not that far. Put your dad on. \nTim wakes up. The morning light hurts his hung over eyes. \nJOAN (CONT'D) Hey. Did you not look at the schedule on the fridge? Did we not have this conversation 10 minutes before I left? (listens, sighs) No, no, no. The playoffs are in Ralston. This is the last regular season game. He actually has a chance to play, Richie. Christ. \nTim staggers out of bed, smiles. Joan holds up a finger. \nJOAN (CONT'D) Fine, but watch your speed on 84th by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's gotten busted twice right there. By that golf course. (LISTENS) Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick some butt for me. `K. See ya. \nShe hangs up. Tim does a theatrical stretch and yawn. \nTIM Good morning. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJOAN Crisis on the home front. Sorry if I woke you up. \nTIM No problemo. \nTim sees that Joan's computer is open-- and his Two Diamond presentation is up on the screen. \nTIM (CONT'D) Is that...? Were you looking at my Two Diamond presentation? \nJOAN Your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so I shut it off. When I saw the discs, I figured I'd take a look. It's a solid presentation. \nTIM Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's... \nJOAN Yeah, I see that. (WISTFUL BEAT) You know we were together right? \nTIM What? Whaddaya...? You and... You and Roger, you mean? \nJOAN It's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the Brangelina of ASMI for a while there. It ended two years ago. He was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now. \nTim is livid. He ejects his disc from Joan's computer. \nJOAN (CONT'D) Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter. You knew, didn't you? \nBill Krogstad paces in a church, talking on his phone. \nBILL KROGSTAD Tim, Bill Krogstad again. Orin Helgesson told me about your little hootenanny in the pool there. Clear violation of ASMI's Morals Code-- meaning we lose our ASMI certification, we lose our Two Diamond rating, we lose our customers and I lose any chance of ANYONE buying my goddamn business. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nBILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) I may as well just commit suicide... \nPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) Father of the bride. We're set. \nReveal: An OBESE BRIDE, 25, and her greasy, mustached GROOM, 40, pose for a PHOTOGRAPHER. \nBILL KROGSTAD (to Photographer, despondent) Yah. Be there in a... (INTO PHONE) Call me when you get this Tim. Because unless you pull off a miracle, we're done. You've let me down hard. Cripes... shaping up to be the worst day of my life. \nKrogstad hangs up. He walks over to his large, beaming daughter. He puts on a fake smile as she gives him a hug. \nBILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) You look real beautiful, Kayla. Like a flower. \nThe photographer snaps a photo. Krogstad chokes back tears. \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE BATHROOM - DAY \nTim stares at his cell phone. He looks in the mirror. \nTIM Goddarnit! \nHe picks up a hairbrush and tries to break it. But it won't break. Dean enters. \nDEAN That time of the month? (off Tim's look) C'mon man, it's gonna be OK. \nTIM No it's not. Nothing is OK. My job, my fianc\u00e9... (dawns on him) God, I'm a philanderer. I've let Bill down. I've let everybody down. \nDEAN C'mere, kiddo. Sit. Sit down. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDean leads Tim out of the bathroom. Tim sits on a desk chair. Dean sits on the edge of the desk. He looks fatherly. \nDEAN (CONT'D) My ex, Patti? Well-established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain, right? But like I say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- I'm the bad guy. `Cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home PREGNANT-- oh yeah, happy day in the Ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's the one planning the baby showers and taking Meg to the gyno, all that shit? The fucking Deanzie. That's who. \nTim stares at Dean for an incredulous moment. \nTIM Is this...? Why is this all of a sudden about you, Dean? \nDEAN I'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing. If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right. If not, fuck it. Life's way too short to lose sleep over shit that don't matter. \nTim slowly nods, surprised to find himself moved. \nINT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nOrin enthusiastically introduces a WOMAN in a smart pantsuit. \nORIN Without any more ado, our keynote speaker, Iowa Insurance Commissioner, Mrs. Susan Voss! \nThe room goes nuts. As Orin leaves the stage he spots Tim waiting in the wings. Tim gestures for Orin to come outside. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nOrin, stone-faced, approaches Tim. \nTIM President Helgesson, please let me stay in the Two Diamond contest. Please. This isn't for me-- it's for Bill Krogstad. I can't let him down. Please just let me compete. \nA moment. Orin nods, almost imperceptibly. \nINT. HOLIDOME ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER \nTim and Orin silently ride the elevator to the fourth floor. \nINT. THE TIFFANY SUITE - MOMENTS LATER \nOrin opens the door to the Tiffany Suite, a slightly larger version of the Junior Suite. He ushers Tim inside. \nORIN (self-deprecating, but proud) Tiffany Suite. Bit much. Perks of the Presidency, guess you'd say. Please. Have a seat on the davenport. \nTim sits. Orin goes to the mini-fridge, takes out a Sprite. \nORIN (CONT'D) Drink? \nTIM Ah, no. Thanks. \nORIN Suit yourself. \nOrin opens the Sprite, drinks. He reaches into a briefcase. He hands Tim a document with dozens of signatures on it. \nDEAN (CONT'D) I can count on your vote tomorrow, right Ronimal? \nRONALD Not a snowball's chance in Hades. \nDEAN You're all a bunch of dicks. \nRONALD (spots Tim O.S.) Hey there, Hangover Harry. 18 hours and counting. Got your guns loaded for the Two Diamonds, partner? \nTim's guilt is apparent in his awkward demeanor. \nTIM Um. I... I don't know about that. \nRONALD Don't be nervous. You'll do fine. There's a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program-- might help ease your mind. \nTIM I'm sorry about... Ronald. Just... about everything... \nTim abruptly walks away. Dean and Ronald look at each other, perplexed, as Tim exits the hotel into the pouring rain. \nEXT. CEDAR RAPIDS STREET - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) \nA cold, hard rain falls as Tim walks from the Holidome toward an Applebee's across the busy street. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. APPLEBEE'S - CONTINUOUS \nTim enters and walks to the bar. He's soaking wet and looks despondent. A cheery female bartender, KAY, 40, greets him. \nKAY Happy Saturday! What'cha drinkin'? \nTIM A large cream sherry, please. \nAs she pours a healthy glass of sherry: \nKAY Looks like you could use some cheering up. What do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks? (PAUSE) Fowl weather. \nTIM (DISTRACTED) That's pretty hilarious. \nTim slams the sherry in one gulp-- to Kay's dismay. \nTIM (CONT'D) Another please. I have to use the little boy's room. \nKay watches as Tim heads for the bathroom. He leaves his cell phone on the bar. \nINT. APPLEBEE'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTim pees at the urinal. He zips up, goes to wash his hands. In the mirror, he's shocked to see: A squinty, drugged out MAN, 25, exit the stall, followed by... Bree. \nA moment of recognition. \nTIM Bree? (off her confused look) It's Tim Lippe. From the ASMI convention. We met out in front of the Holidome across the street? \nBree coughs a hacking, phlegmy cough. She's very out of it. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM (CONT'D) That's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters? Smoker's cough. Ha. Just kidding. Butterscotch? \nHe removes a few hard candies from his pocket. She takes one. \nTIM (CONT'D) Small world, huh? \nBREE Totally. You wanna party? \nTIM Ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask. But I have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so... \nThe squinty-eyed man, GARY, who has been drinking out of the sink, looks up at Tim. \nGARY I gotta work in the morning, too. Can't be productive or whatever without occasionally taking a little ride on the good times express. It's like, fuck that shit, yo. \nTIM Yeah. I hear that. L & C. Loud and... clear. \nBREE Seriously. We're going to this thing at my Uncle Ken's later-- after his shift's done. \nBree examines Tim, standing stiffly, hands in his pockets. \nBREE (CONT'D) You look like you're in serious need of some relaxation, dude. \nBree nonchalantly pinches his nose. Tim looks oddly touched. \nTIM I have had a pretty messed up day actually. Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY - NIGHT \nDEAN You two are a couple of serious fucking downers, man. Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him Ronimal. Maybe he already knew. Shit, the kid's one of my best friends... \nRONALD You met him two days ago, Ziegler. \nDEAN Know what, blow me Ronald. It's not my fault you're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him. Do what you want, but the Deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing OK. \nINT. UNCLE KEN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT \nBoston's MORE THAN A FEELING blares on the radio of a pick-up truck. Tim politely rocks out, sandwiched between Bree and Gary in the front seat. A violent-looking, wire-thin man in an Applebee's uniform, UNCLE KEN, 40, drives. After a bit: \nTIM That must be pretty all right, Ken, getting half off at Applebee's all the time. I'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds... \nUNCLE KEN Pass me that cube, Skeet. \nGary opens the glove box, passes Ken a glass pipe. Ken lights up, takes a hit, passes it to Bree. Bree follows suit, then passes the pipe to Tim. Tim looks at it, pauses. \nTIM Ah...? This would be marijuana, I'm guessing? \nA beat. Then they all laugh like crazy. So Tim laughs, too. Bree puts the pipe in Tim's mouth. He looks frightened. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nBREE Suck the glass dick, dude. \nThey laugh. Bree lights the pipe. Tim inhales and instantly: oh fuck, Oh Fuck, OH FUCK! Tim's eyes bulge, his teeth grind. Then he shakes his head like a wet dog and violently COUGHS. \nTIM Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez. \nBREE A butterscotch might help. \nINT. HOLIDOME HALLWAY (OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM) - NIGHT \nDean has his phone to his ear. Ronald and Joan watch. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE) Hello. \nDEAN Trying to reach Tim Lippe. Who am I talking to? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE) This is Kay over at the Applebee's. Your friend left his phone here. \nDEAN That right? Is he there now? \nKAY (O.S. ON PHONE) No he's not. Be honest, I was kinda worried about the little guy... \nINT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nA series of shots as Tim-- sweaty, high and extremely hyper-- dances with Bree to the deafening death metal. The party is a volatile mix of BIKER TYPES and SPEED FREAKS. Even though his salmon-colored oxford shirt has come untucked from his casual slacks, Tim still looks a tad out of place. \nThe following conversation is shouted because of the music. \nTIM I FEEL AMAZING! THIS IS AWESOME! \nBREE HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE ON YOU? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM AH, CASH-WISE? ABOUT 90 DOLLARS, I THINK. I'VE GOT A TON OF TRAVELER'S CHECKS, THOUGH. WHY? \nBREE I'LL GET US SOME MORE CRYPTO. THEN YOU CAN FUCK ME IF YOU WANT. \nTIM (not sure he heard right) DO WHAT NOW? \nBREE JUST GIMME A HUNDRED. \nTim pauses. Then-- what the heck. He unzips his money belt... \nINT. APPLEBEE'S - NIGHT \nDean, Ronald and Joan look worried as they listen to Kay, the friendly Applebee's bartender. \nKAY Like I say, he was pretty ripped from all that sherry. He left with Ken and them for some party. \nDEAN Who's Ken? \nKAY (CONSPIRATORIAL) Ken's our cook. We all think he deals dope, though. I get along good with everyone. But Ken? He's just real different. \nRONALD Oh jeez. D'you know where they were going? Any idea? \nKAY You could try Ken's place. It's way out in the boonies... \nINT. FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT \nBree snorts a line in a disgusting, fetid bathroom. Tim sits on the counter. He's jacked up, sweaty and very chatty. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nORIN (terrified, through gag) Nmmmmmmmmm! \nTIM I did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. But there's never been a recorded hog- bite death. So... \nWith great difficulty, Tim picks up Orin. Then, he awkwardly hurls him over the barbed wire fence. Orin lands on his back in a deep pile of mud and hog shit. The hogs descend. \nTIM (CONT'D) The Two Diamonds may be meaningless to you and Bill. But there are people who care about this stuff. Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest, good people. I'll come back for you after the Two Diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner. I'm really sorry about this, Orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you. \nTim goes to his car, leaving Orin wriggling with the hogs. \nINT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nA HUSBAND and WIFE sleep. Their phone rings. They stir. The clock says 6:45 AM. The woman rolls over. \nWIFE Who the heck's calling at this hour on a Sunday morning? \nThe man answers the phone. (NOTE: We should now recognize the couple as the clients Tim dealt with in the Northlands conference room.) \nHUSBAND Hello. \nTIM (O.S. ON PHONE) Kurt Gambsky, Tim Lippe-- your insurance agent. How's Pam and the girls? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nHUSBAND (whispers to wife) Tim Lippe. (TO TIM) Um, fine, Tim. We're fine. Everything OK by you? \nINT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS \nTim talks on his cell as he drives. \nTIM Well, I think everything's OK. Hope it is anyway. Listen Kurt, here's why I'm calling... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - LATER THAT MORNING \nAn eagle soars on a large video screen. A patriotic anthem plays. We boom down from the screen to find Ronald. He's on stage finishing up his Two Diamond presentation. \nRONALD People sometimes say that promises are cheap. You know what Ronald Wilkes says to that? N-S-F. Not so fast. At the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed. And the word I give you at Ronald Wilkes Insurance is-- I will work for you. Thank you. \nThe words, \"Ronald Wilkes Insurance: Working For You\" appear on screen. Ronald's face dissolves over the eagle. \nThe CROWD goes nuts, applauding wildly. Dean and Joan start a standing ovation. Ronald, though exhausted, beams on stage. \nTim is nowhere to be found. An EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER addresses the crowd. \nEXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER Once again folks, President Helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave ASMI early due to a family emergency. I haven't been able to reach him on his mobile, but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to Orin and his family. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nEXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER (CONT'D) (a moment of silence) Now... we're set to hear our final Two Diamond presenter. Tim Lip from Northlands Insurance. Tim? \nJoan, Dean and Ronald exchange worried looks. Dean stands. \nDEAN Hey Travis, I don't think Tim... \nJust then, Tim appears. He is filthy-- covered in mud, sweat, hog shit and tears. He futilely smooths his hair and tries to tuck in his shirt as he takes the stage to sparse applause. \nTim goes to the computer set up on stage for Power Point. He puts in his disc. His presentation appears on the screen. \nTIM (SEVERELY COUGHS) Thank you. I'm Tim Lippe. Hog farm risk mitigation... What is...? \nTim knocks a folder off the podium. Papers fly everywhere. \nTIM (CONT'D) Smooth move, Ex-Lax. (a few chuckles) So, Hog... No. I, ah... this girl I met, sorry woman, I guess. She's 23. She takes drugs, and I think might be some kind of prostitute. (a collective gasp) But she's super insightful. Y'know what she said to me last night? Said the only real insurance is love. That's fricking INTENSE, isn't it...? \nAwkward murmurs. At this moment, a very pleased Bill Krogstad walks in with Mike Pyle. Krogstad tenses, however, when he sees Tim's state. \nTIM (CONT'D) I'm... ah... Our only true safety net. Love. Crazy. I believe in insurance. I believe in love... \nTim laughs. He looks up and sees Bill. \nTIM (CONT'D) Bill! Bill Krogstad. My former boss, everybody. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nBILL KROGSTAD (JAW-CLENCHED SMILE) What're you doing, Lippe? \nTIM Why'd you do this, Bill? I don't understand. \nKrogstad chuckles, preferring to avoid any public drama. \nTIM (CONT'D) Why'd you do it, Bill? Why'd you do it? Why'd you lie, Bill? \nBILL KROGSTAD (to the audience) Sorry, folks. Guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business. Must've missed that constitutional amendment. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Want your get out of jail free card back? \nTIM Not particularly. \nDEAN When I saw it, at first I was like, shit am I supposed to take money out of the account, or what? \nTIM Did you? \nDEAN Nah, it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat his pathetic ass out if he didn't drop the charges against you. \nTIM (a genuine smile) Sweet. \nDean tosses the paper into the trash. We now see what it says. On Holiday Inn stationary, in Tim's scrawl: www.paypal.com. Username: OrinHelgesson. Password: PontoonMan123. \nINT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - DAY \nDean drives. Ronald rides shotgun. Tim and Joan are in back. The minivan cruises past downtown Cedar Rapids. Tim looks up at the buildings. So tall. \nRonald considers his Two Diamond plaque. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD It's not as cool as I thought it'd be. I don't think this is even real wood. \nDEAN (lacking his usual energy) I'll show you some real wood. \nRonald starts giggling. It turns into a laugh. The laugh becomes infectious. Before long, Tim, Joan, Ronald and Dean are all laughing their asses off. \nEXT. CEDAR RAPIDS AIRPORT - EVENING \nDean, Ronald and Joan accompany Tim, now cleaned up, to the airport. Tim sets down his old American Tourister. \nTIM Well. \nJOAN Deep subject. D'aar. Get it? (punches his arm) I told you you were a hero, Lippe. Insurance Man saves the day! \nTIM Tss. Ruined it more like. \nJOAN True sign of a good day. \nDEAN Well, pal, it's been real. \nTIM (CHOKES UP) I'm gonna miss you guys. \nRONALD Yeah. You bet. \nDEAN Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs? Fuckin' believe that? Anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on Lake of the Woods. Canada? I can use it whenever I want. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDEAN (CONT'D) I say we book it for June, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there. \nRONALD More time in a tightly enclosed space with Ziegler. Gee, sign me up. \nTIM I think it sounds awesome. \nRONALD Actually, me too. The Ronimal could use a vacation. \nDEAN Done. \nDean picks Tim up in a bear hug, spins him around. Ronald gives Tim a more subdued hug. Then there's Joan. \nJOAN So. Keep in touch. E-mail, all that good stuff. \nTIM You bet. You bet. You too. \nJOAN If you're ever-- not that you would be-- ever in Oh-my-God, Nebraska... \nTIM Yeah. Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I used to watch that. Would be cool some day to see. \nJOAN Yeah. Look me up. \nTIM So. \nHe puts out his hand. She laughs and hugs him instead. Tim closes his eyes. She feels so good. Smells so good. \nJoan's eyes are wide open. She swallows hard. She will not cry. It's OK. Keep telling yourself everything will be OK... \nDISSOLVE TO: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. PLANE - NIGHT \nTim looks out the window, watching the city lights of Cedar Rapids fade away. He catches his reflection in the window. He exhales. He smiles a little. \n", "test1_input": "MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) He says hey. \nTIM Oh. Tell him hey. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Tim says hey... \nA beat of silence. Tim looks irritated. \nMILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D) I picked up that diet wet food for Brandy today. \nTIM I have to do some work before bed, so... \nMILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE) (TERSE) Well I should let you go. \nTIM No, it's-- I love you so bad, babygirl. It's so hard here. I just miss you. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) I miss you, too, Tim. But this was your decision. You have to act like a big boy now. \nTIM Tss. Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) You'll be fine. Just be careful. \nTIM OK. You, too. I love you. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTim hangs up, world-weary. \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE BATHROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nTim sits on the toilet. His laptop sits on the counter, the Two Diamond presentation on the screen. He practices for the full-length mirror on back of the bathroom door. \nTIM Current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to... \nThe bathroom door opens. It's Deanzie. Tim shrieks. \nTIM (CONT'D) I'm in here! \nDEAN (WHISPERING) I know. This needs to be private. (WHIFFS) Whoa. Something didn't agree with you, did it? Second thought, meet me in the stairwell after you wrap things up in here. \nINT. STAIRWELL - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nDeanzie sips from a mini-bar bottle of rum as Tim, now in a flannel bathrobe and slippers, enters the dingy stairwell. \nTIM What the heck is going on here? \nDEAN You sound like my fuckin' wife, Timbo. Jesus. Ex, I should say. EX. \nDean sits heavily on the cement stairs. He hiccups, burps. Tim looks at Dean with a feeling that borders pity. \nTIM Are you drunk? \nDEAN Fuck yeah! (calms himself, whispers) Fuck yeah. But we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. I figured some shit out. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDEAN (CONT'D) Like I told you, no shocker-- Helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close... \nTIM We're not close... \nDEAN Close enough. You're voting for me for President, right? \nTIM No I'm not. \nDEAN Well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's Two Diamond Awards. \nTIM I know. I heard. \nDEAN Well hear this: After you left the bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me-- Pyle of shit, I call him-- and he asks do I want to sign this thing. And I go, \"Lemke might have been a class-A deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep...\" \nTIM Pardon my French, Dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. My boss, Bill Krogstad? He told me how you called up Joyce Armbr\u00fcster and smeared Roger's name all over town... \nDEAN Joyce who...? Oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old whore called ME. Harping about Lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. So I says, \"OK, I'll run some numbers.\" Well, she calls back later that same day, says she got Krogstad to lower her premium. Which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place. \nTIM So wait, you didn't call her? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDEAN I may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em. \nTim lets this sink in. Dean hiccups and burps again. \nTIM So what's with this petition? \nDEAN Personally? I think Mike Pyle of Shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. Dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up Northlands at a bargain basement price. And you know what else I think? I think Orin's in on the deal somehow. \n", "test1_true": "TIM What? That's impossible. \nDEAN I can't quite figure it myself, but I know what I know. And what I know is you're wading into some duvious, er dubious, shit. Just be careful. \nTim looks shell-shocked. What a long, long day it's been. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA SERIES OF SHOTS -- AS SLUMBER OVERTAKES THE HOLIDOME \n- IN JOAN OSTROWSKI-FOX'S ROOM: Joan is bent over her tub, applying a Clairol Nice `N' Easy home hair color kit. She gets up, puts on a shower cap . She applies cold cream to her face. She looks tired and decidedly middle-aged. \n- IN THE HALLWAY: Bree drunkenly escorts a different INSURER back to his room. \n- IN THE JUNIOR SUITE BEDROOM: Ronald sleeps soundly, gently snoring. Tim tosses and turns in his cot. He looks out into the living room where he sees: \nDeanzie at the desk chair, gently masturbating. We move in to see what he's looking at: A photo of a woman in a bikini. She's attractive enough, carrying a few too many pounds. Certainly no supermodel. Pull out to reveal: Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nThe woman is the subject of a Christmas photo card. The typed script reads, Happy Holidays from Dean & Patti Ziegler. Christmas `93, Panama City Beach, FLA. \nNext to the woman stands a younger, slimmer Deanzie. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. SUNSET TERRACE BALLROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nTim holds hands with Ronald and a DOUGHY MAN at a round table in a room full of people holding hands. Orin says a prayer. \nORIN ... In Your Name we pray Lord Jesus, Son of God, Author of our Salvation, our Redeemer, our Truth. Amen. \nAmen. The gathered INSURERS head to the breakfast buffet. \nRONALD Orin knows how to lead a prayer breakfast, tell you what. \nTIM Hmm...? Oh. Yeah. \nRONALD Little overwhelming? All this? \nTIM Hello, thank you. I feel like my head is gonna like... (makes explosion face) Y'know? \nRONALD Oh I hear ya L & C. Loud and clear. I was the same way when I first came to ASMI. The deciding which break-out sessions to attend, plus the politics, the pressure, the not knowing who to trust... \nOrin catches Tim's eye, gives him a friendly wink. Just then, Tim's phone rings. He looks at the caller ID. \nTIM Excuse me, Ronald. It's my boss. (ANSWERS PHONE) This is Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT./EXT. BILL KROGSTAD'S BUICK LESABRE - DAY \nBill Krogstad talks on the phone as he drives. His wife, DIONE, crochets in the passenger's seat. \nBILL KROGSTAD Tim. Bill Krogstad. Got a call from Orin Helgesson. Tells me he's worried about you. Tells me you're palling around with Dean Ziegler. Laughing at his jokes, buying him drinks... \nTIM (O.S. ON PHONE) I... No... \nBILL KROGSTAD What's the ONE thing I told you to do? The one thing, Tim? Steer clear of Dean Ziegler. GODDAMNIT, you're lousing the whole thing up! \nDIONE KROGSTAD Bill... \nBILL KROGSTAD Not now Dione. \nINT. HOLIDOME LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nTim tries to get a word in. \nTIM Bill, I... That Dean Ziegler-- he was trying to warn me about Orin. \nBILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE) Warn you about Orin? Orin Helgesson has been ASMI Midwest Region President for 13 years! He is a LEGEND! And what do you do?! You go and pal around with his sworn enemy-- who, P.S., is a drunken loser! \nTIM Bill, I'm sorry... \nINT. BILL KROGSTAD'S LESABRE - CONTINUOUS \nKrogstad punches the car roof. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nBILL KROGSTAD I sent you to ASMI to restore our image, Tim. One day into the deal you're lousing the whole thing up! (TO DIONE) See how far Gladstone is from Cedar Rapids, Dione. Look in the atlas. \nDIONE KROGSTAD You're not driving to Iowa, Bill. This is your daughter's wedding. \n", "test1_id": 2592, "test2_input": "The sun is low. Long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of 70-foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice. \nTim and Joan run up to Orin, who is waiting by the silos. \nORIN OK guys, this is it. First team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match. (unfurls a scroll, reads) ASMI's past is behind us; But our future looks nice; Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century... by scaling this silo of ice! \nSome DUDES with ice climbing equipment-- ropes, picks, etc. appear. Tim looks petrified. Joan shakes her head. \nJOAN That doesn't even... There's no such thing as silo ice climbing. \nTIM No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa. ABC news did a story about it. I saw it on YouTube. \nJOAN Of course you did. Well, you can do it then... \nTIM Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared crapless of heights. \nJOAN You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz I'm not climbing jack. (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJOAN (CONT'D) Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that... \nTim's nostrils flair. Just then, Mike Pyle and his partner arrive. Tim looks to the top of the silo. It is dizzyingly high. He shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales. \nTIM Yeah. Let's do this thing. \nOrin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music (Whitesnake's HERE I GO AGAIN, perhaps). \nQUICK CUTS: The Dudes get Tim and Mike Pyle into their climbing gear-- harnesses, helmets, crampons. \nAnd they start climbing. Sort of. Tim jams his pick into the ice. He tries to pull himself up, but can't. Mike fares worse. He can't even get his pick to stick in the ice. \nTIM (CONT'D) Hang on... How's it...? \nMIKE PYLE Little help here... \nThe Dudes shout instructions. Tim and Mike try again. To no avail. Neither could do a pull-up if his life depended on it. \nA LITTLE WHILE LATER -- \nAll the contestants have shown up. But not a damn one of them can get more than a foot off the ground. \nTIM Ugh. This is frickin' hard. \nRONALD Really hard. \nDEAN I think I just shit my pants. \nJoan cheers. Orin looks to the Dudes, who shrug. \nA LITTLE WHILE LATER -- \nOrin talks on his cell phone, conferring. The contestants wait in a field, shivering. The sun is getting lower. Orin hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nORIN OK gang, that was Rick Martini with the National Chapter. Here's the deal. Since no one could do the final task, and since Joan and Tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. Unless anyone's got a problem with that? \nRonald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance. \nRONALD Dangit. You could've done better, Wilkes. \nTIM Wait, we won? \nORIN Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75 gift card for the Westdale Mall. \nOrin hands Joan the gift card. Despite the anticlimax, Tim is overjoyed. He picks up Joan and spins her around. Everyone else just wanders away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) - THAT EVENING \nTim is ebullient. Joan rides shotgun. The screen on Tim's phone says that he's missed 11 calls. It rings again. \nTIM Oh crap. I forgot... (ANSWERS PHONE) Hey, Millie. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) I have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours, Timothy. I was going to call the police. Where have you been? \nTIM I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! My teammate and I, that is. Joan. \nJOAN Hi Millie! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTIM That was Joan saying hi. (beat, to Joan) Millie says hi. \n", "test2_true": "Something dawns on Tim-- who gives a shit. He glances at Joan and her skirt and her exposed knee. \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Lucky for us it came out naturally or we'd have been looking at surgery. \nTim pulls into a spot in the Westdale Mall parking lot. He gestures for Joan to wait a second. \nJOAN I'll just meet you inside. \nTIM OK. Sounds good. (TO MILLIE) Sorry Mil, go ahead. \nINT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMillie looks wounded. \nMILLIE So who's this Joan? \nEXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS \nTim gets out of the car. \nTIM Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with. Between you and me, she's a little different. Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar gift card, I'm not going to complain. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nMILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) You promised you'd check in with me. I'm very disappointed. \nTIM (PLAYFUL) OK, Mom... \nSilence. It's as though a profound revelation has just slipped out. As if, in an instant, everything has changed. \nINT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMillie's heart sinks. She looks at her Beanie Babies. \nMILLIE Well. You obviously have more important things to do than talk to me. My brother and I were just getting ready to go for fish at the Eagles anyhow. \nReveal: Wade is sitting in his rightful throne, watching an aerobics show on TV. Millie snaps at him. \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Go warm up the car, Wade. \nTIM (O.S. ON PHONE) Mil, I didn't... \nMILLIE It's fine. You'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, Tim. Good Night. \nMillie hangs up. Wade gives her a supportive shrug. \nEXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS \nTim snaps his phone shut. What just happened? He considers his options for a moment. \nINT. WESTDALE MALL - MOMENTS LATER \nJoan window shops at a LensCrafters. Tim approaches her. \nTIM Hey. What say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here? At the mall. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nJoan smiles at him, and we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. OLIVE GARDEN - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nTim approaches the Olive Garden MA\u00ceTRE D'. \nTIM We have a gift card. But I didn't make a reservation. Is that OK? \nSave for three tables of ELDERLY PEOPLE, the place is empty. \nMA\u00ceTRE D' Right this way, sir. \nTim raises his eyebrows to Joan-- not too shabby. \nINT. OLIVE GARDEN, ROMANTIC BOOTH - A LITTLE WHILE LATER \nTim and Joan are seated in a candlelit booth. Opera Muzak tinkles. If you didn't know this to be a mall-based chain, you might think it a romantic Italian restaurant. Maybe. \nAn acne-scarred WAITER, 21, approaches with a tray. \nWAITER Coors Lite for the madam. A cream sherry for monsieur. And here are some bottomless bread sticks. \n", "test2_id": 2593, "test3_input": "INT./EXT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS \nDean sits silently in the driver's seat. The quiet gets to him. He starts humming, then mumble-sings to himself and drums the steering wheel. \nDEAN Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJoan and Ronald make their way through the house, clocking the aggressively angry looks as they go. Joan sees something: \nJOAN Oh shit. \nIN THE KITCHEN: Uncle Ken is choking Tim. The PARTYGOERS cheer. Uncle Ken punches Tim in the stomach. Tim falls to the filthy linoleum. Bree protests. \nBREE But he paid for it, Uncle Ken... \nUNCLE KEN You can't let some dude pay for crystal meth and an ass fuck with a traveler's check, Bree. That shit can be traced. \nTIM (WHEEZING) It's fully insured. 100 percent. (THEN) And we didn't make love... \nUNCLE KEN Shut the fuck up. \nHe kicks Tim hard. It's looking bad, when all of a sudden: \nRONALD (O.S.) Hey! HEY! \nThey all turn to see Ronald. In the black trench coat, he actually looks BAD ASS. He has one hand in the coat pocket. \nRONALD (CONT'D) (hard-core gangsta speak) I may look like some suit wearin' businessman to y'all. Truth is, I'm straight up gangsta. And I always keeps one in the chamber... (indicates the bulge in his pocket) ... in case you ponderin'. So I suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be. Muthafucka. \nUncle Ken blinks a few times. Then he lets Tim get up. \nRONALD (CONT'D) Indeed. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRonald takes Tim's arm. Joan joins them. The three of them walk backwards toward the door. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nDean is outside the minivan, taking a leak on a tree. He looks toward the house. \nDEAN Oh fuck! \nRonald, Tim and Joan exit the house. \nRONALD Run! \nThey run for Dean's minivan. Tim slips, sliding across the snow and mud. Ronald drags him halfway across the lawn before Tim finally gets to his feet. \nDean, meanwhile, tries to finish peeing as he makes his way back to the van-- doing a sort of crab walk to avoid pissing on himself. Tim, Ronald and Joan dive into the minivan. Dean climbs back into the driver's seat. \nBree and gang exit the house and watch as Dean peels out, tossing up bits of gravel as he speeds away. \nINT. DEAN'S MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER \nDean looks nervously in the rearview mirror-- all clear. Ronald tries to calm Tim down in the backseat. \nDEAN What the fuck happened? \nJOAN Oh my God, Tim. Are you OK? \nTIM (JITTERY) I don't know. I don't know. All I know is I was getting kicked and then Ronald was there talking like a ghetto person... \nDean looks at Joan and Ronald-- What? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nRONALD In order to extricate Tim from what was clearly a volatile situation, I did, in fact, rely on my community theater training. I don't like to brag, but I do a pretty convincing Omar from the HBO program, The Wire. (beat, as a gangsta) Least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it. \nDEAN The Ronimal! \nThe minivan speeds through the dark, rainy night. \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nTim sits on the couch bouncing his legs, still messed up. Joan sits with him. Dean and Ronald watch, worried. \nTIM I can't believe Bill would do this to me. He was like a father... \nDEAN Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo. Orin's the real devil in this deal. \nJoan shoots Dean a look-- shut the fuck up. \n", "test3_true": "RONALD Shoot, you could come work for me if you wanted. \nFor some reason, Tim finds this funny. He laughs hysterically. \nTIM I love you, Joan. \nJOAN (to Dean & Ronald) Get some sleep you guys. I'll stay up with him-- make sure he doesn't chew his arm off. \nRonald sighs, nods. Dean kisses Tim's sweaty forehead. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nDEAN Sleep good, little friend. \nDean and Ronald head for the bedroom. Tim looks at Joan. \nTIM I didn't make love to Bree, Joan. \nJOAN It doesn't matter. Here, lie down, Lippe. \nTim rests his head on Joan's lap. His eyes are still on fire. \nJOAN (CONT'D) (SINGS QUIETLY) Oh dear, what can the matter be Johnny's so long at the fair. He promised to bring me a pocket of posies... \nTim shuts his eyes. Joan must be a good mom. \nA KNOCKING sound fades in, providing a: \nSOUND BRIDGE TO: \nINT. THE TIFFANY SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nOrin stirs in his king-size bed. The knocking is at his door. He gets out of bed, puts on a robe and goes to the door. He peeks through the eyehole. \nORIN Oh, Tim. Just a sec. \nOrin glances in the mirror, smooths his hair. He undoes the chain and opens the door... \nTim bursts in and attacks! Orin, being relatively frail, immediately tumbles to the carpet. This can't be good. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT./EXT. BILL KROGSTAD'S LESABRE (DRIVING) - NIGHT \nKrogstad yawns but drives with determination as his car passes a sign that reads CEDAR RAPIDS - 100 MILES. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nINT. JUNIOR SUITE - EARLY MORNING \nDean and Ronald sleep soundly in their beds. We drift off of them to the couch, where Joan has fallen asleep. She wakes, realizes that Tim is no longer there. \nJOAN Oh shit... \nINT./EXT. TIM'S RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) - EARLY MORNING \nThe first hints of daylight illuminate the eastern sky. Kenny Loggins' WHENEVER I CALL YOU FRIEND plays on the radio. Tim, still hopped up, drives. He enthusiastically sings along. \nTIM Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light. I never seen such a beautiful sight! See love glowin' on us every night, I know forever we'll be doin' it right! \nTim drives past a farm and sees dozens of hogs foraging around in a sloppy pen. He stomps the brakes, sliding dangerously onto the muddy shoulder. \nEXT. RURAL ROADSIDE/HOG FARM - CONTINUOUS \nTim gets out of the car. The peppy song is still playing. Tim sings along as he dances to the back of the car. \nTIM I always wanna call you \"friend!\" Sweet love showin' us a heavenly... \nTim opens up the trunk. That's when we see: \nINSIDE THE TRUNK: Orin, in his pajamas, bound and gagged by Holiday Inn bedsheets. His shouts are muffled by the gag. \nTim pulls Orin from the trunk. Orin's feet are tied together, so he has to hop as Tim leads him toward the hog farm. \nTIM (CONT'D) Careful. It's super slippery. \nOrin falls face first into the muddy ditch. \nTIM (CONT'D) Whoop. Careful now. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 \nTim helps Orin to his feet. Several enormous HOGS rush toward them on the other side of a barbed wire fence. \n", "test3_id": 2594}

ANDY Sir, do you have a problem? 
ZMUDA (AS JERK) Yeah, my problem is you're tired. 
Andy winces. 
ANDY I, I was asked to do this material - 
ZMUDA (AS JERK) Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes... 
ANDY (defensive) Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- 
ZMUDA (AS JERK) Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny! 
GEORGE - is dumbfounded. 
GEORGE (to himself) Why...?  Andy, why...? 
ON ANDY AND ZMUDA 
ZMUDA I used to think you were original. 
ANDY I was very original! 
ZMUDA Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt. (he gleams cruelly) In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. (back to Andy) Isn't that true??? 
Andy shudders. 
The audience averts their eyes. 
A painful silence. 
"Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed. 
EXT. LA IMPROV - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Andy and George walk sadly down the street.  There is a horrible gloom over them. 
ANDY The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want... 
GEORGE (sadly) Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you. 
The guys stop walking.  George gently speaks. 
GEORGE (cont'd) You've gotta make the public embrace you again.  You have to win back their sympathy... 
ON ANDY 
He nods. 
ANDY I'll come up with something. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAUREL CANYON, BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The telephone wakes up Lynne in the new bedroom.  She looks over -- Andy's not there.  She looks at the clock and it's 4:30 am.  She picks up the phone. 
LYNNE Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been worried sick... NOW??... Where do you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call them... 
Lynne's baffled. 
INT. DENNY'S - DAWN 
Late-night Hollywood weirdos mill about.  Andy sits with bleary Lynne, Zmuda, and George.  Zmuda admires the menu. 
ZMUDA Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes -- $2.99!  How do they do it? 
LYNNE They get you on the coffee. 
GEORGE (irritable) Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us why we're here??? 
All heads turn.  A long pause. 
Then -- Andy stiffly speaks. 
ANDY I have cancer. 
Beat.  Zmuda nods. 
ZMUDA Hey, that's good!  We can make that play. (spitballing) And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die... 
GEORGE FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. 
Pause.  Lynne is puzzled. 
LYNNE Andy, are you serious? 
ZMUDA (grinning) Serious like a heart attack!  Hey, maybe I can push you around in some goofy wheelchair! 
Andy softly shakes his head. 
ANDY No, it's true.  I have lung cancer. 
GEORGE That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke. 
ANDY (emphatic) I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. 
Lynne's eyes tear up.  She hugs onto Andy.

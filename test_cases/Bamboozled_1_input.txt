DELACROIX C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. 
ORCHID Peerless, last time, go see your father. 
EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is being said.  He sits up and starts to do a dance for her. To her. 
ON BENCH 
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance. 
SLOAN Are you trying to seduce me? 
He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet." 
SLOAN (CONT'D) You think that's gonna work, huh? 
He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position. 
ON MANTAN AND SLOAN 
They kiss. 
EXT. I-95 SOUTH - MORNING 
Delacroix is driving "down south." 
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself.  HE SPEAKS TO US through the MIRROR 
DELACROIX I figured this was a good time to get away.  Just jump in my ride and go.  I always did my best thinking when I was driving alone.  I needed to think out clearly what I was going to do with this MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. 
EXT. I-95 SOUTH 
Delacroix is driving on his way to "Ole Virginny." 
EXT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK - NIGHT 
Delacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink, funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint. 
CLOSE ON NEON SIGN 
"MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK" - most the letters do not light up, underneath it, "2-NITE - JUNEBUG." 
INT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK 
It's loud as hell as Delacroix enters this smoky, dark establishment. 
P.O.V. DELACROIX 
This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM, the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from "Luke" video. 
ON SUGAR SHAK 
Delacroix works himself through the crowded BAR/DISCO into another small room. 
ON COMEDY ROOM 
He walks into a small space where his father JUNEBUG is on the stage. 
ON JUNEBUG 
He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and sips it often. 
ON COMEDY ROOM 
Delacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him. 
ON DELACROIX 
He looks around. 
P.O.V. DELACROIX 
It's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty. 
ON TABLE 
A couple gets loud, arguing over something. 
ON JUNEBUG 
JUNEBUG 'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please show me some respect.  I'm up here trying to make a living. 
MAN Mind yo' business. 
JUNEBUG Don't make me have to come over there and whoop you upside ya head. 
The sparse AUDIENCE laughs. 
JUNEBUG (CONT'D) Just messin' with ya.  But please if you and your lady need to discuss something, take it outside. Thank you. 
He continues on with his show. 
ON TABLE 
Delacroix walks over to the fighting couple. 
DELACROIX Brother man, that's my father up there and I drove a long way to see him perform.  Please take this fifty, go buy you and the young lady some drinks in the club. 
The guy looks him up and down.

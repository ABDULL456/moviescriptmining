Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid. 
PLISSKEN I said go! 
Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at the prototype in Plissken's hand... 
UTOPIA Don't take it back. Don't give it to him. Please. Let me have it. 
Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her. 
PLISSKEN What does this thing do? 
UTOPIA (her eyes grow wide) No! 
KABLAM! 
Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh! He spins, drops the prototype... 
... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims... 
KABLAM! 
He fires again, hits Plissken's leg. 
Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward... 
... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor. 
Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to raise it... 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE So long, Snake. 
Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ... 
Plissken spins, and dives off the edge... 
... down into the drop off... 
PLISSKEN'S BODY 
Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness swallows him up... 
Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel. 
CUERVO JONES Where is he? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE He jumped. Down there. (beat) He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken. 
Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below. Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie. 
CUERVO JONES Give it to me. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man. 
CUERVO JONES (extends his hand) Give it. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you. 
Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the prototype... 
... but slips on the wet floor... 
... and drops the prototype with a CLANK! 
CLOSE - PROTOTYPE 
A red light comes on, blinks urgently. 
PROTOTYPE VOICE (tiny, filtered) I am now armed and ready for use. Use extreme caution. The location of the effected blast area can only be determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Ring. 
Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a smile... 
CUERVO JONES This is turning out to be my lucky day. (stares coldly at Map To The Stars Eddie) Get this asshole outta here. 
Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back along the tunnel. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo, wait. Please...

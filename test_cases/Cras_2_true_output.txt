Catherine and James slam spinning into the tail of a tanker which has all but stopped. The traffic behind them has already been slowing and thus easily avoids hitting the sports car when it comes bouncing to a halt across two traffic lanes. 
Catherine lies back, sprawled in her seat, eyes wide and staring with fright, body rigid, bleeding from a small cut on her cheekbone. James jumps out of the car, then immediately slows with a limp. He continues, working his way doggedly through the motionless cars to the edge of the ramp. 
When he looks over the edge, James sees that Vaughan's Lincoln has plunged into the top of an airline coach which was running on the roadway below. With the Lincoln now inside it, the coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other vehicles. 
Wreckage, flames and blood are everywhere. 
James's eyes are wide: not with horror, but with excitement. 
EXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT 
Catherine and James stand at the gatehouse of the police pound, collecting the gate key from the mustachioed, sharp- eyed young officer there. 
They then walk down the lines of seized and abandoned vehicles. The pound is in darkness, lit only by the street- lights reflected in the dented chromium. 
They soon find Vaughan's crashed Lincoln, massive and charismatic even here, even in death. James manages to wrench open the passenger-side rear door enough to allow them both to get inside. 
INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Sitting in the rear seat of the Lincoln, Catherine and James make brief, ritual love, her buttocks held tightly in his hands as she sits across his waist. 
EXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT 
Afterwards, they walk among the cars. The beams of small headlamps cut across their knees. An open car has stopped beside the gatehouse. Two women sit behind the windshield, peering into the darkness. 
A pause, and then the car moves forward, its driver turning the wheel until the headlamps illuminate the remains of the dismembered vehicle in which Vaughan died. 
The woman in the passenger seat steps out and pauses briefly by the gates. It is Helen Remington. When she helps the driver out of the car, James and Catherine see that it is the crippled Gabrielle, her leg shackles clacking as she and Helen begin to walk toward Vaughan's car. 
They stroll haltingly, arms around each other, like strange lovers in a cemetery visiting a favorite mausoleum. At one point, Helen kisses Gabrielle's hand, and it is obvious that they have become lovers. 
James and Catherine circle away from the couple and make their way back to the gatehouse. 
In the depths of the pound, Helen helps Gabrielle into the Lincoln. In the darkness of the back seat, they embrace.

The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming. 
TAPP Freeze! 
Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zeps head. Zep clutches the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can only imagine what hes hearing. 
Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more. 
TAPP (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck? 
Zep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand. 
Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapps head. The blow stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen. 
ZEP Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! (His breathing is fast, desperate. He clutches the wound on his leg.) Im gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming. 
Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. Hes just a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adams eyes widen and he starts to panic. 
ADAM Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes out of Lawrences mouth as the electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence is out.) Lawrence, get up! 
CUT TO Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they can. 
Cut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what to do, panicking. Lawrence cant be dead, he cant be alone in here. He cant handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him. 
ADAM (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! Get up! I need you! (He leans down and finds a piece of debris on the floor, throws it at Lawrence. It doesnt hit him. He leans down, picks up another, throws it. This one bounces onto the floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence starts to move more, reaching for his head and sitting up. Adam cries out in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead! 
LAWRENCE (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he electrocuted me... 
ADAM I told you! The same thing happened to me, see? I wasnt lying, see? 
Lawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. Suddenly, he snaps. 
LAWRENCE (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!! 
Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it. 
In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall.

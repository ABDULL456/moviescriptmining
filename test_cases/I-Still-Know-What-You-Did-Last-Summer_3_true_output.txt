SUPERTITLE:			FOUR MONTHS LATER 
Julie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her shoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school. 
She rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street. She rolls the bike right up to the front door. 
CUT TO: 
107	INT. HOUSE - DAY 
Julie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another bike in the hallway. 
It's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's another NOISE...from inside her house. 
She goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the shadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls. 
NOTHING 
She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses -- 
The dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS. 
It's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster. 
JULIE Ray...what are you doing? 
RAY (toaster) Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. (sees she's shaken) Did I scare you? 
JULIE Never do that again. 
RAY (tender) Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay. (beat) We got the refrigerator in. Come see. 
She sees the love in his eyes. She hugs him. 
JULIE I love it here. 
RAY It's gonna be great. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
107A	INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
Julie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom. She pauses in the doorway -- 
107B	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Ray is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic devicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a low WHIRRING sound. 
RAY (seeing her) Checking the locks again? 
JULIE You know me to well. 
Julie smile and walks to the bedroom. 
CUT TO: 
107C	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Julie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly. The windows are closed. The closet door is shut. 
The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear sits in a chair. 
There is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She hears it again. She climbs out of bed. 
CUT TO: 
107D	INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes from the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds. 
Julie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice the dirty imprint of a boot below the window. 
107E	INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy. 
Behind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious, happy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household. 
107F	INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Julie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a crack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it wasn't. 
Julie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror next to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't see anything. She throws open the closet door. 
NOTHING 
She looks around the room. 
JULIE What is my problem? 
She sits down on the bed. 
We see her bare feet from under the bed.

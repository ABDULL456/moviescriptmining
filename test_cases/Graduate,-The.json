The clouds separate and, far below, we can see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND. As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS and PHRASES as though from a public address system. \n2\tEXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN \nin cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading. \n3\tEXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY \nThousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there. \n4\tEXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY \nBEN - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us?  Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless.  But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you.  I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever. \n5\tSHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY \nstaring at him impassively. \n6\tINTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS \nof impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the podium. \n7\tEXT.

The pages begin to blow away in the wind. \n11\tSHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY \nstaring. \n12\tSHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY \nBEN - there is a reason, my friends, and the reason is - \n13\tCLOSEUP - BEN \nHe is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience. \n14\tSHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY \nThe audience is gone. \n15\tSHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY \nBEN - the reason is - the purpose is - \nSOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at us through the air. \n16\tSHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY \nHuge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT. \nCAPTAIN'S VOICE \nLadies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles - \nSOUND of a SONIC BOOM. \nCUT TO: \n17\tINT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT \nHis eyes open suddenly. \nCAPTAIN'S VOICE The sound you have just heard is the landing gear locking into place.  The Los Angeles weather is clear and the temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do not expect any traffic delay and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the nose.  We enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you again in the near future. \n18\tSHOT \nPULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them. \n19\tREVERSE ANGLE \nPULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and looks out the window. \n20\tEXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT \nLos Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every direction. \nSOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH. \nBEN Just fine, Mr. Loomis. \nMr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall. \nMR. LOOMIS I want to get a drink and then I want to hear all about that thing you won.  That Hopperman award. \nBEN Helpingham. \nMR. LOOMIS Helpingham!  Right!  Now you wait right here. \nMr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket. \nLADY 1 Ben - we're all so proud of you. \nLADY 2 Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud. \nLADY 3 What are you going to do now? \nBEN I was going to go upstairs for a minute - \nLADY 3 No - I meant with your future. \nLADY 2 With your life. \nBEN Well - that's a little hard to say - \nMR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben. \nMR. MCQUIRE Ben! \nBen (to the ladies) Excuse me. (he turns around) Mr. McQuire \nMR. MCQUIRE (overwhelmed with pride) Ben. \nBEN Mr. McQuire. \nMr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall toward the back of the house and out through the back door. \n30\tEXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT \nThe pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard. \nMR. MCQUIRE Ben - I just want to say one word to you - just one word - \nBEN Yes, sir. \nMR. MCQUIRE Are you listening? \nBEN Yes I am. \nMR. MCQUIRE (gravely) Plastics. \nThey look at each other for a moment. \nBEN Exactly how do you mean? \nMR. MCQUIRE There is a great future in plastics. Think about it.  Will you think about it? \nBEN Yes, I will. \nMR. MCQUIRE Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal. \nMr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben. \nWOMAN #1 Here he is now.  Here's Ben. \nBEN Excuse me just a minute - \nBen goes into the house through the back door. \n31\tEXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT \nWe can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room. \nSOUND of a door SLAMMING. \n32\tINT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBen stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a window, the SOUND of the WIND. \n32A\tSHOT - LONG SHOT (Location) \nOver Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room. \nMRS. ROBINSON Oh.  I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it? \nBEN It's down the hall. \nThey stand for a moment, loocking at each other. \nMRS. ROBINSON How are you, Benjamin? \nBEN Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is down at the end of the hall. \nMrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed. \nBEN Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean to be rude but - \nMrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it. \nMRS. ROBINSON Is there an ashtray in here? \nBEN No. MRS. ROBINSON Oh - I forgot.  The track star doesn't smoke. \nShe blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the wastebasket. \nMRS. ROBINSON Is it a girl? \nBEN Is what a girl? \nMRS. ROBINSON Whatever it is you're upset about. \nBEN'S VOICE Could I speak to you for a second, Dad? \nBut Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience. \nMR. BRADDOCK - what was I saying? \nMRS. ARNOLD Feature attraction. \nMR. BRADDOCK Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see you're paying attention.  A feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard. \nThey all laugh and some applaud. \nMR. BRADDOCK Now I'm going to ask for a big round of applause to bring this boy out here - wait a minute - let me amend that - to bring this young man out here - because today he is twenty-one-years- old - \nMR. ARNOLD (his hands like a megaphone) Let's get on with the show! \nMR. BRADDOCK Just hang on a minute because I have a few words to say - \nMR. ARNOLD You always do. \nThey laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy comeback. \nBEN'S VOICE Dad - could we just talk about this for a second? \nMR. BRADDOCK Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning - \nMR. ARNOLD Bring him out! \nPETER AND LOUISE On with the show!  On with the show! \nMR. BRADDOCK (to the window) I can't hold them much longer, Ben.  You better get out here. \nBEN'S VOICE I'd like to discuss this. \nMR. BRADDOCK (to his audience) This boy - I'm sorry - this young man - is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award Scholar - but before he does - \nMr. Braddock darts back to the window. \nMR. BRADDOCK - before he does - (to the window) You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them. \nBEN'S VOICE Dad - can you listen - \nMR. BRADDOCK (meaning it) I'll give you ten seconds. (back to the people) He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks - so let's hear it for - \nMr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open. It slams against the wall inside. \nMR. BRADDOCK - Benjamin Braddock! \n44\tINT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY \nAt the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand. \nThe people applaud. \n45\tEXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV \nThe people in the backyard.  His father stands just outside the screen door. \nMR. BRADDOCK Folks - this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep - \nBen's arms come into view and pull the mask down. \nWe are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. \nSOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly. \nWe MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. \nWe MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both begin to motion us toward them. \nWe get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under.  He has a big smile. \nWe SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool. \n46\tEXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV) \nLooking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it. \nPULL UP AND UP AND UP \nUntil there are thirty houses below us, with its owners, swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing, sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools. SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND of the WIND. \nHold for a few seconds, then: \nSOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n47\tINT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN \nIn a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds the receiver to his ear.

ROBINSON'S VOICE Benjamin? \nBEN Look - I was thinking about that time after the party - \nMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Where are you? \nBEN - and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something - \nMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Where are you? \nBEN Uh - The Taft Hotel. \nMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE Did you get a room? \nBEN No.  Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather - \nThe CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table by the window. \nPUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.

Hello. \nHe rises quickly. \nMRS. ROBINSON May I sit down? \nBEN Of course. \nHe pulls out a chair, for her. \nMRS. ROBINSON Thank you. \nThey sit down. \nMRS. ROBINSON How are you? \nBEN Very well.  Thank you. \nBen tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table. \nMRS. ROBINSON May I have a drink? \nBEN A drink?  Of course. \nBen looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand. The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs. Robinson apologetically. \nBEN He didn't see me. \nMRS. ROBINSON Waiter! \nFor a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back. The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson. \nMRS. ROBINSON I will have a martini. \nWAITER No. 1 Yes, madam. \nThe waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go. \nMRS. ROBINSON You don't have to be so nervous, you know. \nBEN Nervous.  Well, I am a bit nervous.  I mean it's - it's pretty hard to be suave when you're - \nHe shakes his head. \nMRS. ROBINSON Did you get us a room? \nBEN What? \nMRS. ROBINSON Have you gotten us a room yet? \nBEN I haven't.  No. \nMRS. ROBINSON Do you want to? \nBEN Well - I don't.  I mean I could.

BRADDOCK Would you  mind telling me then - what were those four years of college for?  What was the point of all that hard work? \nBEN You got me. \nMR. BRADDOCK (trying unsuccessfully to control himself) Now listen, Ben.  I think it's a very good thing that a young man - after he's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on.  But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass. \nMrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock. \nMRS. BRADDOCK The Robinson's are here. \nMr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out the sun. \nMR. ROBINSON Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with yourself these days? \nBEN Oh - not too much.  Taking it easy. \nMR. ROBINSON That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that.  Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon.  I want you to call her up this time. \nBEN I will. \nMR.

BRADDOCK Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin. \n84\tSHOT - BEN \nBEN Hello, Mrs. Robinson. \nMRS. ROBINSON Hello, Benjamin. \nMRS. ROBINSON If you want. \nBEN Good.  I mean are we dead or something? \nMRS. ROBINSON Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other. \nBEN All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together. \nMRS. ROBINSON Are you tired of it? \nBEN I'm not.  No.  But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then? \nMRS. ROBINSON Well what do you want to talk about? \nBEN Anything.  Anything at all. \nMRS. ROBINSON Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences? \nBEN Oh my God. \nMRS. ROBINSON Well? \nBEN Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best we can do let's just get the god- damn clothes off and -- \nShe reaches for her shoe. \nBEN Leave it on!  Now we are going to do this thing.  We are going to have a conversation.  Think of another topic. \nMRS. ROBINSON How about art. \nBEN Art.  That's a good subject. You start it off. \nMRS. ROBINSON You start it off.  I don't know anything about it. \nBEN Oh. \nMRS. ROBINSON Don't you? \nBEN Yes I do.  I know quite a bit about it. \nMRS. ROBINSON Go ahead then. \nBEN Art.  Well what do you want to know about it. \nShe shrugs. \nBEN Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art. \nMRS. ROBINSON Neither. \nBEN You're not interested in art? \nMRS. ROBINSON No. \nBEN Then why do you want to talk about it? \nMRS. ROBINSON I don't. \nBen nods and looks at the rug. \nMRS. ROBINSON Can I take off my clothes now? \nBEN No.  Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today. \nMRS. ROBINSON Do you really want me to? \nBEN Yes I do. \nMRS. ROBINSON I got up. \nBen starts shaking his head. \nMRS. ROBINSON Do you want to hear it or not? \nBEN Yes.  But you might try and spice it up with a little originality. \nMRS. ROBINSON I got up.  I ate breakfast and went shopping.  During the after- noon I read a novel. \nBEN What one. \nMRS. ROBINSON What? \nBEN What novel did you read. \nMRS. ROBINSON I don't remember. \nBen nods. \nMRS. ROBINSON Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until - \nBEN There! \nMRS. ROBINSON What? \nBEN Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about. \nMRS. ROBINSON Him? \nBEN I mean everything.  I don't know anything about how you - how you work this.  I don't know how you get out of the house at night.  I don't know the risk involved. \nMRS. ROBINSON There isn't any. \nBEN There's no risk? \nShe shakes her head. \nBEN How do you get out of the house? \nMRS. ROBINSON I walk out. \nBEN You walk right out the door. \nBEN Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who... \nMRS. ROBINSON All right.  Now let's get to bed. \nBEN Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. So how did it happen? \nMRS. ROBINSON What? \nBEN I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances? \nMRS. ROBINSON Not particularly. \nBEN Was he a law student at the time? \nShe nods. \nBEN And you were a student also. \nMRS. ROBINSON Yes. \nBEN At college. \nMRS. ROBINSON Yes. \nBEN What was your major? \nMRS. ROBINSON Why are you asking me all this? \nBEN Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college? \nMRS. ROBINSON Art. \nBEN Art? \nShe nods. \nBEN But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then. \nMRS. ROBINSON Kind of. \nBEN Well how did it happen? \nMRS. ROBINSON How do you think. \nBEN I mean did he take you up to his room with him?  Did you go to a hotel? \nMRS. ROBINSON Benjamin, what does it possibly matter? \nBEN I'm curious. \nMRS. ROBINSON We'd go to his car. \nBEN Oh no.  In the car you did it? \nMRS. ROBINSON I don't think we were the first. \nBen thinks for a moment. \nBEN What kind of car was it? \nMRS. ROBINSON What? \nBEN Do you remember the make of the car? \nMRS. ROBINSON Oh my God. \nBEN Really.  I want to know. \nMRS. ROBINSON It was a Ford, Benjamin. \nBEN (jumping up) A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a Ford!  That's great! \nMRS. ROBINSON That's enough. \nBEN So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford. \nThere is a pause. \nMRS. ROBINSON Don't talk about Elaine. \nBEN Don't talk about Elaine? \nMRS. ROBINSON No. \nBEN Why not? \nMRS. ROBINSON Because I don't want you to. \nShe walks to the bed. \nBEN Well why don't you? \nShe pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his jacket. \nBEN I wish you'd tell me. \nMRS. ROBINSON There's nothing to tell. \nBEN Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden? \nMrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows. \nBEN Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's -- \nMRS. ROBINSON Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out. \nBen looks at her. \nMRS. ROBINSON Do you understand that? \nBEN Well look.  I have no intention of taking her out. \nMRS. ROBINSON Thank you. \nBEN Well don't thank me, because I want you to. \nThere is a long pause. \nMRS. ROBINSON But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you?  I want you to promise me that. \nThere is another long pause. \nBEN Look.  Why the hell did you bring this up.  It never occured to me to take her out. \nMRS. ROBINSON Then give me your word you won't. \nBEN This is absurd. \nMRS. ROBINSON Promise me, Benjamin. \nBEN All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson. \nMRS. ROBINSON Thank you. (pause) Benjamin - \nBEN Let's not talk about it.  Let's not talk at all. \nAt opposite sides of the room, without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \n92\tINT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY \nBen sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are there. \nMR. BRADDOCK Elaine's back from school.

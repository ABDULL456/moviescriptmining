FINN Solo, why are we here again? 
HAN To get your droid on a clean ship. 
REY Clean? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet. 
FINN We can trust her, right? 
HAN Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare... 
REY AND FINN At what? 
HAN Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And... 
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY 
We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is MAZ KANATA. 
MAZ Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here. 
HAN (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away. 
MAZ Where's my boyfriend? 
HAN Chewie's working on the Falcon. 
MAZ I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled. 
GA-97 Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here! And we CUT TO: 
IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled: 
BAZINE Inform the First Order... I've found the droid. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY 
A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 
A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see. 
KYLO REN Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT, 
ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY 
Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says: 
MAZ A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess. 
HAN Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAZ Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home! 
HAN Leia doesn't want to see me. 
FINN Please, we came here for your help. 
REY What fight? 
MAZ The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. 
FINN There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE. 
FINN (CONT'D) What's this? What are you doing? Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn. 
FINN (CONT'D) Solo, what is she doing?

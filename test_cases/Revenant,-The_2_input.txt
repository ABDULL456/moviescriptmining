Bridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) So that's what we did. 
Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. But to Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade. 
HENRY Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you would. 
FITZGERALD More than his share, Captain. 
And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger drops his eyes to his feet. 
HENRY Speaking of shares. 
Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination, then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open... 
...revealing STACKS OF CASH. 
Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a handful... starts counting them out onto the desk. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change? 
FITZGERALD Fortunate for me, it did not. 
HENRY Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud. 
Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple bills in front of Bridger. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You're owed something for what you did. 
Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have to look someone in the eye. 
FITZGERALD He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more. 
HENRY We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done. 
FITZGERALD That's what I been tellin' him. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY 
Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing those crumpled bills in his hand, crying. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TEE-PEE - DAY 
Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe. His eyes flicker open. 
CUT TO: 
GLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE. 
GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much better than we last saw. And the stitches are gone from his face, now just long, pink scars. He stiffly raises himself up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him... scarred but clean... no maggots. 
He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting on the ground... waiting for him. 
EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY 
ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn't seen the light of day for weeks. 
Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the scene. 
And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. The Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs. 
A WOMEN'S O.S. VOICE turns Glass... 
...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him, bundled in fur. She says something else we can't understand... points to Glass' feet. Glass looks down... to his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed. 
And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his hand... leads him back into the tee-pee. 
INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS 
Glass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a basket... hands them to Glass.

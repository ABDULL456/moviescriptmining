{"train": "\"Mission: Impossible 2\", shooting draft, by Robert Towne \nMISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 \nBy \nRobert Towne \nRevised. 12/4/99 \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"SCENE OMITTED\" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nFADE IN: \nA WORN SATCHEL (MOVING - DAY) \nis being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black armband.  VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH exits a gleaming building, pausing for a moment, under a motto clearly visible above his head, 'Where the future is now'.  He checks the time. \nINSERT - WATCH \nset in Countdown Mode.  It's at 19 hours forty-seven minutes and sixteen seconds and dropping, 19:37.15,  :14,  :13,  :12 etc. \nO.S. children are singing: \nRing a ring a rosy/a pocketful of posy/ a tissue a tissue/we all fall down. \nNekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent Natural History Museum.  They are moving in and around an odd freeform sculpture. \nPOV - SCULPTURE AND CHILDREN \na blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, almost like mirrors in a fun house. \nNEKHORVICH \nwipes his eyes, a horn honks.  He looks toward the sound. \nMOVING SHOT - SATCHEL (INT. AIRPORT SECURITY - DAY) \non the belt that takes it thru X-Ray.  On the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, hi-tech and at odds with the other items.  She pulls out an urn- shaped vessel. \nGUARD What's this, then? \nNEKHORVICH (handing her documents) The ashes of a colleague, I'm taking them to his family.  If you wish to open it, please be careful. \nCOMPUTERIZED SCREEN DISPLAY (INT. PLANE - MOVING - DAY) \non the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight point of departure in Sydney, continuously updating distance, direction and time to its ultimate destination, Atlanta, Georgia. \nCAPTAIN'S VOICE - folks, we're a little over two and a half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but if you look out your windows on either side of the aircraft, we'll soon be crossing the southern section of the Rocky Mountains, a range which includes more than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet. The chain's loftiest point, Mount Elbert, at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view as we pass over central Colorado shortly.. \nNEKHORVICH (INT. CABIN - DAY) \nseems intent on the map, its changing times and distance.  He checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending seconds whipping by. \nETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat beside Nekhorvich. \nETHAN You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor.. \nNEKHORVICH Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious. \nETHAN They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends. \nNEKHORVICH (meaning Ethan) I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri. \nETHAN Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances. \nNEKHORVICH Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..' (bemused laughter, then looks at Ethan) - you do know Gradski thought the world of you. \nNekhorvich is overcome.  Ethan puts a comforting hand on his shoulder: \nETHAN He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded? \nNEKHORVICH Yes, he knew.  Just.. \nETHAN ..not in time to save him. \nNEKHORVICH No.  After you've lived with Chimera for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...Bellerophon. \nNekhorvich pats the satchel. \nThe MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to: \nEXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY) \nFor a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan climbs out of shot. \nWIDE UP ANGLE (DAY) \nrevealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead. \nEthan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on the soundtrack. \nThen a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter. \nIt's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan. Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his climb. \nA HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY) \nnear the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of feet to oblivion. \nETHAN Whoaa.. \nHe pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang. \nREVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT \nwith Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To lizard: \nETHAN You're welcome. \nThe lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back. \nEthan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm. \nThe helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses. \nETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES \nFirst, a retinal scan. \nELECTRONIC VOICE Identity confirmed. \nSWANBECK Good morning, Mr. Hunt. \nSwanbeck's face flashes onscreen.  Over his introduction of Nyah is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive she never seems to give the camera a clean shot. \nSWANBECK'S VOICE Your mission, should you choose to accept it, requires you to recover a stolen item, designated Chimera.  Essential to the mission is the recruitment of a civilian -- a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall.  She is a highly capable professional thief currently active in Spain. \nA series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i.e., warrants, complaints, Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville. \nSWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd) Her dossier's available on I-COM 3.  You have 48 hours to recruit Ms. Nordoff-Hall and meet me in Seville to receive further details.  Should you or any member of your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. \nSwanbeck's face reappears on screen: \nSWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd) And Mr. Hunt - the next time you go on vacation, please be good enough to let us know where you're going.  This message will self-destruct in five seconds. \nEthan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space. \nETHAN If I let you know where I'm going - \nThe glasses explode in a puff of smoke. \nETHAN (cont'd) - won't be on holiday. \nEthan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit.  Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries of flamenco dancers. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE) \nBustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, exits her car and enters the villa. \nA FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE) \nwhere to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets.  The dancers perform on a raised platform and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them. \nREVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN \nlooking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one another.  Ethan approaches her. \nShe stiffens - he knows too damn much. \nNYAH - right..where is it? \nETHAN Far right. \nShe immediately switches her efforts from top left to the bottom right compartment.  She's utterly nonplussed: \nNYAH Where's the bloody - \nETHAN (plucking it off his chest, offering it up like a mechanic under the chassis) - torque wrench. \nNYAH - this is very disconerting.. \nETHAN Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told. \nNYAH - right.. \nShe unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque wrench and carbide pick - and it's open.  She withdraws a velvet pouch and opens the pouch.  Out spills the spectacular necklace. \nNYAH (cont'd) Lovely. (starting to close the safe) Who are you and what's it going to cost me? \nETHAN (having sat up) I wouldn't do that. \nNYAH Do what? \nThe alarm goes off. \nETHAN That. \nThe bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in. \nSENOR DE L'ARENA Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you! (in Spanish to security guards, annoyed) It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer. \nETHAN Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is that the heat sensors were activated.   But Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate - \nSenor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand. \nSENOR DE L'ARENA Mucho gusto, senorita. \nETHAN - did feel that she had rather too long to work on the safe before they triggered the alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall? \nNYAH Oh yes.  Absolutely.  Much too long I should yes. \nNyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary, intensified curiosity - about Ethan. \nETHAN Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall? \nNYAH Indeed. \nETHAN Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we? \nHe offers Nyah his arm.  They start out.  Ethan immediately stops. \nETHAN (cont'd) Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten something? \nNyah looking genuinely puzzled. \nNYAH The necklace? \nNyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering string of diamonds and rubies from her bust. \nSENOR DE L'ARENA (a great kidder) What are you trying to do, senorita?  Rob me. \nThey all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door. \nEXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN) \nThe stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.  Ethan and Nyah emerge from the villa, walking slowly.  Nyah's clearly preoccupied. \nNYAH I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing. \nETHAN At least you walked. \nNYAH If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it? \nETHAN Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together. \nNYAH May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind? \nHe pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into his arms.  For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.  Then: \nNYAH What's you name? \nETHAN Ethan Hunt. \nNYAH Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about? \nThru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.  Her dark eyes suggest wit, and willingness, and longing. \nETHAN ...more than I thought.. \nThey scarcely to move to bring their lips together: \nNYAH Awfully short notice.. \nETHAN Care to wait a decent interval? \nNYAH Who wants to be decent?.. \nDISSOLVE: \nCLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE) \nsleeping.  His eyes open slowly.  He comes to full consciousness, his head still on the pillow.  Something approaching serious anxiety informs his features.  He lifts his head and looks at his left, angle widening.  Nyah lies on her side facing him, sleeping serenely.  Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't- approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed.  He lets his head flop back on the pillow.  Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to- profile.  As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced by curiosity and even wonder.  He lifts his hand and just brushes her cheek.  Her eyes open.  She knows where she is. \nETHAN So what've you got against spooks? \nNyah smiles. \nNYAH When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing. \nETHAN Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book. \nNYAH They've got a book for this? \nETHAN They've got a book for everything. \nNYAH The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies. \nETHAN Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar. \nNYAH That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't. \nETHAN Which is? \nNYAH That they're lying. \nEthan laughs. \nNYAH (cont'd) ..once they know that they can get very very..crosee.. \nNyah shoulder and moves into Ethan. \nETHAN So where did I got right? \nNYAH You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one.. (then) ..this thing these blokes pinched.. \nETHAN I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes. \nNyah stops to think about this. \nNYAH Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief.. \nETHAN So do I.  Sort of. \nNyah looks at Ethan, a little worried. \nNYAH Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid? \nETHAN Of what? \nNyah laughs. \nNYAH Ask a question, you get an answer!.. \nETHAN Damn, you're beautiful. \nNYAH That's because I'm on my back. \nEthan sits back, heavily. \nSWANBECK (cont'd) - Hunt, are you listening?.. \nSlowly looking up: \nETHAN If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight? \nSWANBECK You were there. \nSwanbeck clears his throat.  He turns back to the computer and punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.  File open to computer scans of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat, as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image. \nETHAN \nslowly looks up at Swanbeck. \nSWANBECK When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times? \nETHAN Twice. \nSWANBECK What did you think of him? \nETHAN You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that? \nSWANBECK Not necessarily. \nSwanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain. \nSWANBECK Airline record list Captain Harold Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.  as far as the media and all governmental agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the flight, but in fact he missed it.  He did, however make the next flight - in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size. \nAnother photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially obscured by a ring of police and customs officers. \nSWANBECK (cont'd) Someone on that flight planned an operation designed to down the plane and make it look like an accident.  Someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch but - they don't always get your luggage on the plane, even when you fly first class. \nETHAN So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't. \nSWANBECK Then you do think it was Ambrose. \nEthan barely nods. \nSWANBECK (cont'd) And you're not surprised. \nEthan gives Swanbeck a look. \nETHAN Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it. \nSWANBECK Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers? \nEthan smiles. \nETHAN Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground. \nSWANBECK The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying? \nEthan rises and moves to the window. \nETHAN Right now only Ambrose knows that. \nSWANBECK In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us. \nETHAN In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it. \nSWANBECK - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts. \nETHAN 'Terrorists?' \nSWANBECK Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business. \nETHAN If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that - \nSWANBECK - is where Miss Hall comes in. \nETHAN (blindsided) Excuse me? \nSWANBECK Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him. \nETHAN (acidly) And then what? \nSWANBECK Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you. \nNYAH But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief. \nETHAN You can be a thief and have a conscience. \nNYAH No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this! (pouring herself a drink) What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid? \nETHAN I don't. \nNYAH Someone in possession of all the facts. (she turns away, pauses) Are you telling me I have to do this? \nETHAN Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands. \nNYAH And that's the only reason? \nETHAN Can you think of a better one? \nNYAH Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical. \nETHAN Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this? \nNYAH Much. \nETHAN Then feel better!.. \nLong moment while she looks at him. \nETHAN (cont'd) Well.  That made all the difference in the world, didn't it? \nEthan walks out onto the balcony.  She looks at his back. \nNYAH Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up. \nETHAN What wouldn't make him suspicious? \nNYAH Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself.. \nEthan's been smiling slightly. \nETHAN Serious trouble, Nyah, is something I can always arrange.. \nNYAH IN A SPANISH JAIL \nstanding for front and side mug shot.  O.S. sound of teletype continues.  SUPERIMPOSE:  Ethan holding up something the size of a dime: \nETHAN This little chip sends a coded signal that can be picked up only by our computer. \nOn the screen of the GPS computer, a little yellow blip appears pulsating on the screen. \nETHAN'S VOICE When it's in your ankle we can track you within three feet of anywhere in the world. \nOVER ETHAN AND ONTO COMPUTER SCREEN \nHe types a small Interpol bulletin stating that Nyah Nordoff Hall, apprehended March 13 in Seville, is awaiting extradition while the authorities in London, Paris, and Amsterdam squabble over where she's going to be tried first, for the various thefts and burglaries she's committed in the three cities. \nCOMPUTER SCREEN (AMBROSE TENT ANNEX - DAY) \nAmbrose picking up on a version of the Interpol bulletin Ethan's put out.  He leans over the screen for a moment, then moves to the window, and stares out thoughtful at the bay, almost as if he were watching... \nEXT - NYAH IN JAIL COURTYARD \nFrom a beautiful blue sky,  pan down to the courtyard of the jail where Nyah is allowed out for an airing, seemingly alone but being watched by: \nETHAN AND COMPUTER SCREEN \nHis attention fixed on the screen, Ethan stares at satellite shot of Nyah in the jail courtyard. \nINT - PRISON - NYAH \nbeing allowed a phone call, a prison guard visible b.g.  Cross cut with Ethan. \nETHAN Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there. \nNYAH This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much. \nETHAN Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street.. \nNYAH Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest. \nHer guard, b.g. is handed a note. \nAMBROSE (yes) Mmmm. \nNYAH And my room? \nA long moment.  Ambrose walks to a mirrored wall.  The mirrors are sliding doors.  With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer clothes. \nAMBROSE Thought you could use a little something to wear. \nNyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe.  Ambrose pulls out a slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed. \nAMBROSE ( cont'd) Try it on.. \nNyah hesitates. \nAMBROSE (cont'd) Go ahead.  I'm dying to see if I remembered your size.. \nNyah picks it up. \nNYAH No changing room? \nAmbrose sits on a chair by the window and waits.  Her blouse, belt, skirt, fall on the bed.  As her slender arm reaches down to pick up the Armani: \nAMBROSE \ngrips her wrist, the flimsy Armani dangling in the air. \nCLOSE - NYAH \nmeeting Ambrose's look. \nNYAH You're not interested in seeing how it looks. \nAMBROSE Oh, I am.  Later.. \nThe Armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor. \nCLOSE - ETHAN (DUSK) \nstanding off to one side, listening to Nekhorvich's voice. \nNEKHORVICH ..therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera. \nLUTHER Why's Nekhorvich going on about an old Greek myth? \nETHAN Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon. \nLUTHER That simple, huh? \nETHAN Why not? \nCLOSE - NYAH (INT. AMBROSE BEDROOM - DUSK) \nlying back on a pillow, looking and off into space to right off camera.  She hears Ambrose's voice, with Ethan's voice \nAMBROSE'S VOICE/ETHAN'S VOICE Damn, you're beautiful.. \nNyah reacts as if she'd been rapped on the nose, her eyes moist.  She turns abruptly to camera. \nNYAH Did you say something? \nAMBROSE \nleaning on an elbow, looking down. \nAMBROSE I said you're beautiful, Nyah. \nNYAH Only because..it's spring..chalk it up (looking him dead in the eye) - to spring fever. \nAmbrose, amused, lights a cigarette and inhaling: \nAMBROSE Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here. \nNYAH (more direct) Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards... \nCLOSE - ETHAN (SHEEP FARM SAFEHOUSE - DUSK) \nETHAN Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims. \nLUTHER Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer. \nShe pulls out a fifty-dollar note. \nNYAH Would you mind terribly? \nAMBROSE (cont'd) (amused and turned on) - not at all.  But you'll pay for that and with interest.. \nNYAH I've no doubt.. \nShe heads up the stairs. \nAMBROSE (reaching into his pocket for money) Hold on. \nAmbrose grabs her arm, and she almost drops the envelope she's just lifted.  (NOTE: It is important not to see her actually lift it).  She's holding it, pinned between her right arm and side.  As it's slipping, she notes Stamp above her, looking down and has to conceal what she's holding from him as well: \nAMBROSE (cont'd) Put down a couple of hundred for. \nNYAH To win? \nAMBROSE What else? \nShe takes it and as she does the envelope falls, but she manages to catch it with her left hand, blocking the move with her body as she does. \nWIDER ANGLE - NYAH \nmoves along the aisle. \nETHAN'S VOICE Luther, smallest digital you got.  Ready to transmit.  Betting table twelve. \nEXT - VAN (DAY) \ndesignated as NEW SOUTH WALES DELIVERIES, 'anytime, anywhere.' Luther bursts out of the van, carrying the tiny camera and begins to thread his way thru cars and foot traffic. \nBILLY \nin dramatic contrast ambles at a conspicuously leisurely pace. \nNYAH \npasses Stamp, not seeing him standing just a row above, blocked from her by one of the pillars.  Stamp idly regards her and then decides: he follows. \nLUTHER \nperspiring, approaches the betting table thru the last of the parked cars. \nSTAMP \napproaches the door thru which Nyah had gone and starts to open it - only to have the door slammed in his face and on his bandaged finger by Billy, in a track usher's uniforms. \nBILLY (very solicitous) Sorry about that, mate, that must've really - aggrhh!.. \nEven as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.  If he'd been welded there by a band of steal he'd have more room to maneuver. \nSTAMP Say again? \nBILLY Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh... \nSTAMP Whatever you're about in future, watch your step.  Never know who you might run into... \nStamp looks around, Nyah's nowhere in sight.  He's lost her.  Sees his hand's bleeding and lets Billy go, who nearly drops to the floor. \nSTAMP Where's the loo then? \nBILLY (pointing up) - aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh... \nStamp heads up the men's room. \nBILLY (croaking it out) \nShakes his head, feeling lucky to escape with his life. \nEXT - PADDOCK - BETTING TABLE TWELVE \nNyah into shot.  Stands in line.  She looks around. \nETHAN'S VOICE How'd you do?  Don't turn around. \nNyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye. \nNYAH I managed. \nSTAMP Get your bet down? \nNYAH Just.. \nShe rises.  Stamp waits only a moment then follows. \nAT THE PRIVATE BLEACHERS (DAY) \neveryone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch. \nAmbrose is watching the race through binoculars.  Nyah comes up behind and puts her arms around him.  With her left hand she puts the envelope into his right jacket pocket. \nAMBROSE Your nag is making a run for it on the outside! (lowering binoculars) Bloody hell, Nyah! \nShe's momentarily startled.  Then: \nAMBROSE (CONT'D) You picked another winner! \nNYAH Well, that's good, isn't? \nA BLOW UP (INT. SHEEP FARM IMF SAFEHOUSE - DAY) \nof a shot from a digital camera card. \nETHAN'S VOICE Dr. Segi Gradski, Nekhorvich's colleague and lifelong friend.. \nThe photos is coded with the data in the lower left hand corner, 01.27.99, the time in the right, 10:02:56 A.M.  Burned into the photo is '20 hours, 03 minutes after exposure.' \nEthan paunches in. \nETHAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Twenty hours and three minutes after exposure. (sotto voce) Twenty hours. \nEthan doesn't say anything for a moment, then goes on to the next photo on the card: '25 hours, 40 minutes after exposure.'  It's Gradski again.  Gradski's eyes are darkly circled, his skull look mottled. \nETHAN Six hours later. \nAnother photo: '31 hours, 30 minutes after exposure.' Gradski's bleeding from nose, mouth and ears, the skin eruptions are pervasive, his body an open wound. \nETHAN ( cont'd) Six more hours. \nThe next photo.  '34 hours, 25 minutes after exposure.'  Gradski's body at rest. \nETHAN (cont'd) Three hours after that, Gradski was dead.. \nLUTHER Here's a victim from the Bruny Island outbreak. \nThe victim's face shows a devastation undeniably like Gradski's. \nA long, long moment as Ethan, Luther, and Billy sit in silence. \nBILLY Oh, happy day. \nEthan looks again at the first photo of Gradski. \nETHAN Nekhorvich said 'However we travel, I must arrive at my destination within 20 hours hours of departure.' \nCLOSE - NYAH (EXT. AMBROSE VERANDA - LATE AFTERNOON) \nNyah is on the balcony.  Ambrose enters with two glasses of champagne. \nAMBROSE To Australia.  It's made so many convicts feel at home.  Here's hoping it does the same for you.. \nHe laughs.  She doesn't. \nNYAH Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say. \nAMBROSE (jocular) Then don't say it. \nNYAH I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time. \nAMBROSE To do what? \nNYAH Sort it all out. \nAMBROSE And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans. \nNYAH A change of plans? \nAMBROSE Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind. \nMCCLOY What's happening here?  You're dead! \nNEKHORVICH Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live. \nMCCLOY (confused) It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski? \nNEKHORVICH You are infected with Chimera, my friend. \nINT - AMBROSE BEDROOM (NIGHT) NYAH \nis on the phone. \nNYAH International, please.  I'd like to make a reservation on the next available flight tonight. \nOPERATOR Where to? \nNYAH Where is next available flight going? \nThe operator answers. \nNYAH Fine.  I'll take it. \nShe hangs up, goes to the door.  The house is eerily silent. \nPOV - STAIRWELL (NIGHT) \na play of shadows, the sound of the kitchen fridge. \nCLOSE - NYAH \nMoves softly downstairs & hesitates at bottom, glancing about. \nNYAH Ulrich?..Ulrich!... \nSilence.  she goes into the kitchen.  No one.  She goes out the door. \nOVER NYAH'S SHOULDER - MOVING (EXT. SYDNEY - NIGHT) \nrunning pell-mell down to the shore.  Stops.  Looks outside the small skiff moored at the end of the dock.  It's dark and she decides to chance it.  She moves onto the pier, trying to glide by the boathouse.  A figure darts out and grabs her.  She tries to scream but can't.  The figure whips her around and she sees: \nETHAN Easy, easy, easy, shhh! \nNYAH Oh Ethan!.. \nShe throws her arms around him. \nETHAN Are you okay? \nNYAH I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here. \nETHAN It's going to be okay. \nHe holds her. \nINT - HOSPITAL ROOM \nMcCloy's strapped down, but manages to reach the call button and push it.  Again and again. \nNEKHORVICH No use, my friend.  The medical staff wants no part of this.  Doctors don't fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else. \nMcCloy stares at Nekhorvich for a long moment. \nMCCLOY How could I possibly be infected? \nNekhorvich shrugs. \nNEKHORVICH That's exactly what Gradski said - 27 hours before he died.  With Chimera, the most minute exposure can be fatal. \nMcCloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor.  He grips the edge of the hospital bed. \nNEKHORVICH But then you shouldn't be feeling to ill. not for another three of four hours anyway. \nMcCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety. \nMCCLOY You have Bellerophon. \nNEKHORVICH (mildly) Do I? \nMCCLOY You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it? \nETHAN Luther, do you have the building up and running? \nLuther punches in and up comes a squat little island a hundred yards off shore, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge. \nETHAN (cont'd) That's not exactly it. \nLUTHER Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure.. \nETHAN Nyah still on the property? \nBILLY She hasn't left it. \nThen: \nLUTHER Okay, here you go - \nAs Luther speaks, the building - on his computer graphics, one with the BIOCYTE PHARMACEUTICALS ELEVATORS AND RENDERINGS, is being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the rendering specifications by Luther, as if the building itself were being constructed at a madly rapid pace, from its foundation to its reinforced steel structure, to its honeycombing of floors, to its outer skin.  Luther's reconstitution of the building lot static, but moving around and above it even as he proceeds. \nETHAN Let's start from the inside out. \nLUTHER All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building. \nBIOCYTE LAB \nOnly about eight personnel -- chemists in lab coats, workers in bio-containment suits, etc. -- populate the lab, passing through security door and air locks, monitoring the virus stock, pading the injection gun, etc. \nLUTHER'S VOICE Chimera itself is kept in two places: in production vials in an incubation room and housed in a small airtight chamber - inside three injection guns. \nBILLY'S VOICE Mate, you kill it in both places, we're laughin' and we go home. \nWITH LUTHER AND ETHAN \nETHAN Now how to get in there. \nLUTHER No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol. \nEthan watches the rendition of the Biocyte lobby on screen \nCLOSE - AMBROSE (NIGHT) \nin overhead light, his eyes are dark pits, somehow underlying her saturnine intensity: \nAMBROSE If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security. \nETHAN Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium. \nINT - BIOCYTE ATRIUM SHAFT \nThe height and extent of the atrium are revealed, as well as its conclusion in a glass floor in the ceiling of the lab. \nLUTHER'S VOICE (unhappily) The atrium?  One of a kind.  Runs down the center of the building.  Provides 24-hour natural light via mirrors and daylight storage cells.  Optimal growing conditions for the virus.  Ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the lab's ceiling. \nWITH LUTHER AND ETHAN \nLuther sees the glint growing in Ethan's eye. \nLUTHER Hey, atrium roof closes at sundown. \nEXT - BIOCYTE ATRIUM SHAFT \nAs the sun sets, the louvers of the atrium roof begin closing. \nLUTHER'S VOICE And if the louvers are open for more than thirty seconds at night, the Civil Emergency alarms are tipped.  Those even I can't stop.  Thirty seconds total to get you in and the cable out. \nETHAN Security? \nLUTHER Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop. \nETHAN I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out. \nCLOSE - AMBROSE (NIGHT) \nAMBROSE No, Hunt will prefer to engage in some sort of acrobatic insanity to enter Biocyte somewhere through the atrium where security is minimal.. \nSuddenly there's the roar of helicopter rotors. \nETHAN (EXT. SYDNEY - NIGHT) \nis poised, upside down, on cable against the Sydney skyline. \nreaches down and presses a silent beeper. \nWITH LUTHER (INT. VAN) \nsees a little red diamond-shaped light pop on his screen \nLUTHER Transponder activated..Reading package and Cable is clean. (exhaling, relieved) He's on his way. \nStaring at the buildings control panels. \nETHAN (INT. ATRIUM) \nhugs the floor just out of sight of the befuddled security guard. \nAMBROSE'S VOICE He'll make the attempt at the only possible time for both of us, 11 P.M. - when the guards rotate and the buildings air-filtration generators go active, covering the sound of his break-in.. \nWITH LUTHER \nLUTHER Ethan, the generators are about to go active. We'll be out of contact for eleven minutes. \nCLOSE - GENERATORS \ndark and silent. \nGENERATORS \nturn over and roar to life. \nETHAN AT BOTTOM OF ATRIUM \ncuts into the glass floor, pops it out, and drops thru the opening.  None of it's heard under the generators.. \nEthan drops onto the lab floor and heads across the lab and up the ramp to the hot zone. \nAMBROSE'S VOICE The frequency of the generators operate to our advantage - cutting radio communication from his team for the next eleven minutes.. \nINT - BIOCYTE LOBBY (NIGHT) \nStamp, flanked by several of his team in Biocyte security guard uniform, crosses the lobby toward a pair of actual Biocyte security guards who appear more puzzled than alarmed at this unexpected influx. \nONE OF THE GUARDS What's this, then?  Reinforcements? \nSTAMP Not exactly, mate. \nWITH LUTHER (INT. CONSTRUCTION VAN - NIGHT) \nHis attention in drawn to a spot on the grid where Nyah's transponder blip, a circular yellow one in contrast to Ethan's, is moving.  Troubled: \nLUTHER Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy? \nINT - CHOPPER \nBILLY Exactly where is she? \nLUTHER ..in the building... \nBILLY'S VOICE Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.' \nLUTHER I am. She is. \nAMBROSE'S VOICE Ethan does it the hard way to avoid confrontation.  Neutralizing security guards is simply too distasteful to him.. \nINT - BIOCYTE LOBBY \nThe two guards who had greeted Stamp and his arriving team lie inert on the lobby floor. \nAMBROSE'S VOICE I've never found that a problem... \nWITH BILLY (INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT) \nBilly's so surprised he momentarily gets loose with the copter and it banks off.  As it and he recover: \nBILLY Right. Well, then. She's not likely to be alone. is she? \nLUTHER'S VOICE The question Is 'how many of 'em?' I can't get thru to Ethan. Not 'til the generators go off. \nBILLY When's that? \nLUTHER'S VOICE Not for another eight and a half minutes. \nAmbrose cocks his weapon. \nAMBROSE (cont'd) I'm waiting. \nNYAH (not much more than body length from Ethan) This isn't exactly working out the way you thought it would, Ethan.  Sorry. \nFinger on the injection trigger, she rises and turns the barrel on her arm, firing.  The sound of the air pressure pushing the virus into her is unmistakable, as is the circle of tiny puncture wounds on her skin.  Nyah moves in front of Ethan, covering him, as she turns to face Ambrose. \nETHAN \nshocked by Nyah's gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he resets the 'Countdown' on his chronometer to twenty hours.  As it drops into the nineteen: \nAMBROSE (frustrated in the extreme) You..bitch! \nShe's been laughing away with Ethan: \nNYAH You're not going to shoot, Sean.  Not this bitch.  She's worth thirty-seven million pounds. \nCLOSE - ETHAN'S HANDS \nfingers press a red button on a tiny detonator.  There's a bright heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water -- the plastique killing any airborne virus. \nEthan uses the diversion to grab Nyah and run with her to the far side of the lab, behind a stock of horizontal cylinders. \nINT - LAB \nAmbrose and team recover from the explosion and begin firing on the tanks protecting Ethan and Nyah, surrounding the two with fire and jets of released steam. \nINT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH \nbehind the stack of tanks.  Ethan launches an explosive down a short hallway, blowing a hole in the building's exterior wall. \nINT - ENTRANCES TO THE LAB \nA group of Biocyte security guards enter from behind Ambrose and team and catch them off-guard.  All hell breaks loose. \nINT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH \nETHAN (outraged) What did you think you were doing! \nNYAH I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all. \nThis hits Ethan with the force of a blow. \nETHAN - you who don't have a conscience. \nNYAH (something of surprise to her) I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you? \nETHAN No. \nNYAH Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people. \nETHAN No. \nNYAH I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now. \nShe puts Ethan's gun to her forehead. \nNYAH (cont'd) For god's sake, get it over with. \nTHE HAMMER \npulls back. \nCLOSE - ETHAN \nHe can't fire, lower the hammer. \nETHAN We've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before you start killing anybody.  I'll get Bellerophon into your system by then. Just stay alive.  I'm not gonna lose you. \nEthan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambrose's team, wounding a couple men.  He reaches the wall and dives thru, camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in the air all around him. \nLess than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it. \nPANNING SHOT - PAINTINGS (INT. CULTURAL ARTIFACT CENTER) \nof Aborigine paintings, eerie patterns made of man and nature phantasmagorical, like the patterns that form under the eyelids shortly before sleep.  B.G. the haunting notes of didgeridoo insure they're not being overheard. \nSWANBECK (reading the paintings titles) 'Dreaming of Birds and Flying Fox,' 'Bushfire Dreaming,'  'Wind Dreaming,' -- oddly appropriate - \nETHAN Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah. \nBILLY What are you talking about? \nETHAN Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts. \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND CAR PARK \nMcCloy's black limousine is in the car park. \nETHAN'S VOICE Confirms what Ambrose is gonna do - \nINT - TUNNEL - BEAR ISLAND \nBarrels of toxic materials line the walls, as an armed guard patrols the corridor, leading into the main chamber, where we follow McCloy into \nINT - SLABHOUSE \nMcCloy enters and begins pacing. \nETHAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) - who he's doing it with, and where he's gonna do it. \nEXT - MOTORCYCLE AND LINE OF VEHICLES (DAY) \nspeed along an isolated road in close formation before turning onto a side road, revealed as leading to a bridge across a small strip of water to a small island. \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND - LANDWARD SIDE (DAY) \nAs the cycles and vehicles cross the bridge and approach the front gate, the camera swings around the side of the island establishing the geography and the six cannon emplacements before coming to a stop on \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND - SEAWARD CLIFF - ETHAN \nscaling the seaward side of the island with minimal gear EXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER - BLUFF \nresting like a giant locust, half hidden by a cluster of trees on the bluff overlooking Bear Island. \nBilly's at the controls, with binoculars, maintaining surveillance of the island and environs. \nIn the back, Luther is at Work on his GPS computer. \nBILLY'S VOICE Ethan's out from under the bridge and on the south-east face.. \nEXT - CLIFF/VIEW OF TUNNEL \nEthan climbs the side of the cliff. \nBILLY'S VOICE Ethan, Ambrose and his tem have over the bridge - \nETHAN Copy that. \nEthan reaches the clifftop and sees armed guards patrolling. \nBILLY'S VOICE You all right, mate?  From here it looks like very security.  What's it look like like from there? \nETHAN Risky. \nHe's over the top and moves swiftly to cover. \nEthan surprises and kills a perimeter guard, then runs to a length of grating and lifts one of the panels. \nEthan climbs down through the grating in the roof of the tunnel. Using a bar to swing down, he breaks a second guard's neck and drops to the floor. \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND - ENTRANCE (DAY) \nAmbrose and team drive through the entry gate -- passing its BIOCYTE PHARMACEUTICALS sign and various no-nonsense warnings of 'No Trespassing,' etc. -- before Biocyte security guards close it behind them. \nINT - TUNNEL - NEAR THE GRATING \nETHAN Breached the structure at the ten o'clock grating.  In the tunnel moving toward the target. \nEthan begins heading down the tunnel. \nINT - SLABHOUSE BUILDING \nAmbrose and team enter, where McCloy and his CHEMIST and ACCOUNTANT are waiting.  As Stamp stands back, observing, and Wallis sets up a laptop, Ambrose walks up to a refectory-like table and stands opposite McCloy.  Ambrose reaches into his coat and puts two cannisters on the table in front of McCloy.  McCloy's chemist picks up the cannisters and inserts them into two chambers connected to his microscope. \nCHEMIST It's a DNA match.  The blood's loaded with Chimera. \nAn insert of the microscope plate shows the two samples, as Bellerophen destroys Chimera. \nAMBROSE -- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are.. \nWALLIS Ninety-three point four million. \nAMBROSE Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty. AMBROSE (cont'd) When your stock goes north of two hundred, and it will, those options will be worth billions.  We can borrow whatever we need to buy the 48,000,000 shares, fifty-one percent of Biocyte. \nMCCLOY Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company. \nAMBROSE Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy. \nINT - TUNNEL - OUTSIDE THE SLABHOUSE ROOM DOORS \nEthan pulls a can of explosive material form his pack.  He rolls it towards the double doors, and it stops just before reaching them.  Then, pointing his gun to the ceiling, he fires into the air. \nINT - SLABHOUSE ROOM - AMBROSE \nhears a noise and looks to Stamp, who heard it as well. Stamp nods to two guards to check it out.  They head across the room to the double doors. \nINT - TUNNEL - OUTSIDE THE SLABHOUSE ROOM DOORS - ETHAN \nwaits for the right moment before raising his and firing at the can of explosives.  Just as it ignites, the guards open the doors and are blown back by force of the explosion. \nINT - SLABHOUSE ROOM - AMBROSE \nreacts and turns toward the explosion.  Amidst the flames and debris, a single white dove comes flying into the room.  And beyond it, Ambrose can see Ethan Hunt in silhouette walking slowly past the doorway. \nAMBROSE Run that bastard down. \nOrders are shouted, and guards, along with Stamp, hotfoot it down the tunnel-corridor in the direction of the explosion. \nINT - TUNNEL - STAMP AND GUARDS \nrun down the tunnel.  The guards move commando-style, directed by Stamp's hand signals. \nINT - SLABHOUSE - MCCLOY AND AMBROSE \nAmbrose loads his gun and drags the tip of the barrel along the table. \nAMBROSE We're running short on time, Mr. McCloy. We've got to conclude our business. \nMcCloy pauses only a moment before nodding to his accountant. \nMCCLOY Yes, start the transfer. \nThe accountant begins working on his laptop. \nAMBROSE (to Wallis) Follow it.  Let me know. \nINT - TUNNEL - STAMP AND GUARDS \npass a couple of doorways.  A pigeon flies past Stamp's face and he stops.  As he turn, Ethan Lowers himself from a hiding place in the ceiling.  Stamp and Ethan pull their guns on one another. They're in a face-off until they both agree to drop their guns, but Stamp catches his in mid-air and points it back at Ethan. \nETHAN You broke our deal. \nSTAMP You're too trusting.  Raise your hands slowly. \nAs Ethan raises his hands, he pulls the pin on a grenade and then kicks it between Stamp's legs.  The handle flies off:  It's live. When Stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade, Ethan kicks out his gun. \nTrying to escape the grenade, Stamp smashes into Ethan and seems to have hit him in the jaw.  Both hit the ground as the grenade explodes, with Stamp appearing to have the upper hand. \nINT - SLABHOUSE \nAs everyone waits for the transfer to complete, the grenade explodes out in the tunnel.  McCloy and his accountant freeze with alarm as a sprinkling of dust settles on the room. \nAMBROSE (to the accountant) Keep it going. \nSTAMP'S VOICE Sean, this rat's reached the end of the maze. \nAMBROSE (into walkie-talkie) Is he alive? \nSTAMP'S VOICE More or less. \nAMBROSE Bring him to me. \nINT - HELICOPTER - BILLY AND LUTHER \nLuther has the GPS computer starting to access the satellite. \nBILLY (nervously) We're due to take off. \nEXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER (DAY) \nWith Billy flying and Luther at the door, machine gun in hand, the copter nears the Bare Island gun pit and Ethan. \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND GUN PIT - ETHAN \nruns into the central 'hole' area, guns in both hands and wearing the kevlar vest.  He runs toward the walled edge of the enclosure and jumps.  As he pulls himself up the top of the wall, he sees the IMF helicopter approaching. \nA gunman appears from the tunnel entrance and opens fire, the bullets exploding into the wall around Ethan, who jumps out of the way to avoid them. \nEXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER \nis under fire as well, bullets spraying the windshield, driving Luther back inside and causing Billy to turn the chopper around. \nBILLY Man at your six. \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND GUN PIT - ETHAN \nwho rolls and returns fire at the gunman.  Ethan first hits the gunman in the leg, and then shoots and explodes the canisters behind the gunman, killing him. \nETHAN (to Billy) The field of fire is too heavy.  Back off and pinpoint their positions. \nBEAR ISLAND HILL - MOTORCYCLE \nbearing down on him as he stands up.  Ethan just manages to dive out of its path before a second motorcycle comes up over the hill.  Ethan flips backwards and fires his pistol, shooting the second cyclist off his bike. \nThe motorcycle flies over Ethan, who runs after it and jumps on, revving the throttle and taking off. \nBEAR ISLAND - PARKING AREA - AMBROSE \ndeploys some of his men via walkie-talkie while others scramble into their cars. \nAMBROSE (into walkie-talkie) Hunt's heading for the bridge.  Coming in at twelve o'clock high. \nBEAR ISLAND BRIDGE \nA Gold Falcon with several of Ambrose's men inside enters the bridge from the mainland and speeds toward the island. \nEXT - BEAR ISLAND COMPLEX \nAmbrose's men exit the complex and get into their cars. \nBEAR ISLAND HILL - ETHAN \ncrests a hill aboard the cycle, the IMF chopper in b.g. \nETHAN Clear that bridge for me. \nLUTHER' VOICE Roger that. \nBILLY'S VOICE They're tracking you on the left, Ethan. Prepare for some fire. \nBEAR ISLAND ROADWAY \nMichael's SUV and Wallis' sedan speed along as a gunman from the SUV fires on Ethan up the hill, spraying bullets around him. \nBEAR ISLAND BRIDGE - GOLD FALCON \napproaches the island.  Luther fires his grenade launcher.  It hits the Falcon's trunk, lifting its back wheel off the ground, but the Falcon keeps coming, its trunk ablaze.  Luther reloads as a gunman leans out the window, firing up at Ethan on the hill. \nBEAR ISLAND HILL - ETHAN \nlays on the cycle's throttle, accelerates down the hill and propels the bike into the air and off the island, just as \nEXT - IMF HELICOPTER - LUTHER \nagain fires his grenade launcher, this time at the front of the \nBEAR ISLAND BRIDGE - GOLD FALCON \non the bridge.  The grenade explodes at the front of the car and hurls the Falcon into the air and off the bridge. \nBEAR ISLAND - HILL/BRIDGE - ETHAN \nis in mid-air on the cycle, heading down toward the bridge.  Just as he lands, the Gold Falcon flies off the bridge, and Ethan speeds through the flames and off onto the mainland. \nBEAR ISLAND - BRIDGE \nMichael's SUV arrives and tears through the gate and flames, followed by Wallis' sedan and then Ambrose, riding a motorcycle. \ntearing down the road, when suddenly from a side trail Ambrose pulls out behind him and begins firing.  Ethan weaves to avoid Ambrose's fire and passes a car, pulling in front of it for cover.  The car skids, forcing Ambrose to veer around it. \nFROM COPTER TO GROUND (MOVING) \nrapidly approaching the North Head bluff. \nBILLY There she is.  I got visual. \nLUTHER We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds.. \nHIGH ANGLE - NORTH HEAD \nmoving up behind Nyah who is walking purposefully to the edge of the bluff and a precipitous drop to rocks and surf a hundred and fifty feet below. \nCamera drops to Nyah's shoulder level and moves with her to the bluff's edge.  As she's just a few steps away from stepping off, there's a roar and the helicopter rises into the shot, before her wild-eyed Billy gesturing, 'Stop!  Stop!' to Nyah. \nEXT - ROADWAY \nEthan passes narrowly between a car and oncoming truck.  Ambrose follows as soon as the truck clears.  Ethan fires backward using his side-view mirror to aim, exploding Ambrose's windscreen. Ambrose skids until his wheel clips a rock, knocking him upright. \nEthan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub.  Back on the main road, Ambrose roars off to intercept Ethan. \nEXT - CLIFFTOP - ROCK LEDGE \nOn a clifftop clearing, Ethan races along as Ambrose moves to cut him off.  They head toward one another. \nLUTHER'S VOICE Ethan, we've got her.  Tracking to you now. We're reading 5 minutes 19 seconds. \nEXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING \nEthan and Ambrose round a bend and face one another.  Without hesitating, they charge towards each other.  As they near one another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide hard in mid-air.  They fall to the ground fighting as their bikes skid and Ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them. \nEthan and Ambrose rush towards one another.  Ethan flips Ambrose to the ground.  Ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster.  As Ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off a 30-foot cliff. \nINT - IMF HELICOPTER \nat top speed over Sydney.  Nyah appears weak and shivers. \nLUTHER (to Billy) Bearing two one zero.  About 3 klicks. (into microphone) Ethan, we're moments away.. \nEXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT \nEthan and Ambrose rise from the fall.  Ethan jumps up and sweeps Ambrose, dropping him to the ground.  Ethan begins strangling Ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, Ambrose gets Ethan in a choke hold. \nAmbrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits Ethan in the midsection and the face.  Ethan kicks it out of his hand and connects with several punches, knocking Ambrose to the ground. \nKneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts Ethan across the back and face.  Ambrose dives on Ethan and the knife is poised above Ethan's eye before Ethan grabs the knife and clears, holding it out toward Ambrose. \nAMBROSE Go ahead.  Use it Hunt.  It's not a bad way to go.  A lot better than the way that bitch is going to die. \nAmbrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.  Ethan steps back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand. \nEXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER - CLIFFTOP \nAs they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat. \nEXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT \nEthan turns and walks away from Ambrose toward the cliff edge. The copter lands and Luther runs toward Ethan but pulls up, looking over Ethan's shoulder.  Ambrose has a gun aimed at Ethan's back. \nAMBROSE Hunt.  You should have killed me. \nNear Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by dust from the copter.  Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air.  He catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose. \nEXT/ INT - HELICOPTER ON CLIFFTOP \nEthan reaches Nyah at the copter.  Inches apart, they can only stare silently at one another. \nINT - CULTURAL MUSEUM \nDidgeridoo music.  A child admires a painting.  Swanbeck and Ethan face one another.  A long, long pause.  For a moment it appears as if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence. \nSWANBECK Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions? \nETHAN You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing. \nSWANBECK Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation. \nETHAN I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment. \n", "test1_input": "As Billy speaks, the visual come on line and Nyah has become visible. \nLUTHER (a jaundiced eye, to Ethan) It certainly is.

The slender figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light changes - Ambrose is waiting. \nNyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side into thigh-high water without taking her eyes off Ambrose.

SHEEPFARM SAFEHOUSE) \nThe picture abruptly goes dead. \nBILLY Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting. \nETHAN It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position. \nLuther punches in.  The signal - and the global coordinates are given.  They wait. \nINT - SPACE \nThe satellite positions itself. \nWITH THE THREE \nETHAN Can't we speed this up. \nLuther shoots him a disgusted look. \nLUTHER With what?  This is the only computer that'll do this. \nTHE SIGNALS AND PHOTOS \nstart to bounce back, growing larger and larger on the screen, until:  Nyah can be seen, water up to her thighs, lingering in Ambrose's arms with each blow-up, and linger.  And lingering. \nBILLY - right.  Now there's a bloke who knows how to deliver a proper welcome.  Don't get me wrong, mate.  You were quite hospitable.  Is it him, then? \nEthan's look suggests he's worried about lapse in recruiting judgment. \nLUTHER It is, Billy. \nBILLY Then we got'em! \nETHAN We don't know what we've got because we don't know what he's got, where he's got it or what he's doing in Sydney with it. \nEthan strides away from the screen, the edge in his voice and the move not altogether lost on either Luther or Billy. \nINT - THE BAY (EXT. PALM BEACH - DAY) \nPerfectly poised, still loosely in his arms, Nyah returns Ambrose's penetrating gaze with a pleasant, clear eyed one. \n", "test1_true": "NYAH I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean. \nAMBROSE How grateful? \nNYAH Well that depends. \nAMBROSE On what. \nNYAH How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me? \nAMBROSE (stopping) How I usually find you, Nyah. \nNYAH How do you that. \nAMBROSE Magic... \nNYAH Ahh.. \nPOV THRU TENT ANNEX WINDOW (AMBROSE COMPOUND) \nlooking down the length of the dock.  Ambrose, his arm around Nyah and carrying her suitcase, moves up the dock toward the house and camera. \nStamp steps into the annex and looks over to Wallis, who watches Nyah on the monitors. \nWALLIS No flies on her. (checking her on a scanner screen) No bugs either.  She's clean. \nSTAMP (drily) All cats are. \nINT - ETHAN - SAFEHOUSE (SHEEP FARM - DAY) \nEthan watches the Nekhorvich video on the computer screen. \nNEKHORVICH ...therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera. \nEthan then flips through a series of pictures on the computer depicting the myth of Bellerophon attacking Chimera. \nBilly moves up behind him. \nBILLY What you got there, mate? \nETHAN A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance? \nBILLY Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating.. \nETHAN ..or hard wired.. \nBILLY (please) - or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say. \nLUTHER Ethan, here's Nekhorvich, and here's his boss \nLuther scans an entry from the IMF database with newspaper clippings, sidebars of still of McCloy and Nekhorvich. \nLUTHER (cont'd) McCloy, Jon Chaddick, CEO Biocyte Pharmaceuticals..D.O.B.  September 30, 1952, Manchester, England. \nBILLY (a little lost) Well do you disagree with that? \nETHAN Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site? \nBILLY Oh well, if that's how you feel about it. \nBilly leaves. \nLUTHER ..then Cambridge..Harvard..entrepreneurial efforts..in efforts..in 1989, acquired Biocyte in hostile takeover.. \nAs Luther transfer info to Ethan's computer: \nLUTHER (cont'd) Ethan, have a look at this. \nOn Ethan's screen appears the Biocyte website; where among he various icons one offer McCloy's proud detailing of Biocyte's philanthropic efforts: \nMCCLOY'S VOICE We at out state-of-the-art solar powered Biocyte building recognized that eternal vigilance is the price of health.. whether it's funding the teaching center at the Royal Prince Edward Hospital, removing aerosol products from the marker or braving the influenza quarantine at Bruny island late last month..at Biocyte your life..is our life's work.. \nETHAN (quietly) ..Biocyte workers at Bruny Island. \nINT - AMBROSE'S (DAY) \nThey've reached the head of the stairs.  Ambrose opens a door. It's a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the tent annex and the beach, and a very large bed. \nNYAH Your room. \n", "test2_input": "AMBROSE (cont'd) Don't ever question my judgment again. \nDISSOLVE: \nEMPTY FRAME (EXT. RANDWICK RACE TRACK - DAY) \nwith no sound, the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting and gasping for jostling and going to the whip, the sound of the crowd overwhelming all but the announcer's voice carrying everyone around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing, controlled frenzy. \nEXT - PRIVATE BLEACHER (DAY) \nNyah and Ambrose rising as the horses cross the finish. \nAMBROSE (surprised) You won. \nNYAH (looking at her ticket) I suppose I did. \nAMBROSE What made you pick that nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing. \nNYAH 'Thief in the Night?' \nAMBROSE Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis? \nShe smiles, a little shakily.  Ambrose leaves. \nA VOICE Naturally Vain.. \nIt's Billy passing behind her. \nNYAH Pardon me? \nBILLY 'Naturally Vain.'  In the fourth. Check her out.  She's due. \nBilly hands her a chest sheet and moves on.  She opens it to the fourth race.  Taped onto 'Naturally Vain' is a small plastic piece with the note.  she regards the note, places the plastic piece in her ear. \nETHAN'S VOICE You can speak as if I'm right by your side. \nNYAH (picking up binoculars) Where are you? \nETHAN'S VOICE At the mounting enclosure, just off the tracks at two o'clock. \nTHRU BINOCULARS - NYAH'S POV - MOVING \nthru the crowd onto the track over to the pre-post paddock where an animated gaggle of owners, heavy batters and investerace touts surround it.  Only Ethan is stock still - and looking up at Nyah. \nCLOSE - NYAH \na swift intake of breath as she see him. \nETHAN How's it going?  Everything okay? \nNYAH Just like old times. \nETHAN Just like old times? \nNYAH Just about.. \nShe appears to be the picture of unruffled sang-froid. \nETHAN Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's. \nETHAN'S POV (THRU GLASSES) \nmoving from Nyah to the champagne bar just behind where Ambrose is seen greeting someone in the crowd and they sit at a corner table in front of the window overlooking the track. \nNYAH (a breath, then:) Near as I can tell, there's at least a half-dozen other blokes about the place. Maybe more.  Hugh Stamp, an old mate of Sean's, is the only one I recognize, bit of a creep and then some.. \nPOV ETHAN \nStamp, stands a pillar, his finger bandages, looking glum and looking down at Nyah. \nETHAN We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on.. \nNYAH - Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house. \nETHAN Have you met them? \nNYAH Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door. \nETHAN (looking into Champagne Bar) I've no doubt. \n", "test2_true": "of Ambrose sitting with someone whose face is obscured from his angle by bar patrons. \nBILLY \nis also looking. \nPOV RANGE FINDER BILLY \nand from his point of view it can be seen that Ambrose is talking with John McCloy, the head Biocyte.  Ambrose takes an envelope out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' (Identical to the object first seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security.)  He opens it and removes a small shiny object about the size of a quarter.  He turns to the window and gestures.  Stamp enters the bar. \nBILLY Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something. \nETHAN'S POV \nETHAN I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO. \nLUTHER Nekhorvich's boss? \nETHAN Yep. \nNYAH Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about? \nETHAN Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money -- \nINT - VAN - LUTHER \nis monitoring both cameras.  All see Ambrose give the little wafer-like object to Stamp who places it in a small camera, hands it back to Ambrose and exits, waiting just outside the glass door.  Ambrose hands the camera to McCloy who looks puzzled. \nLUTHER Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how to use a digital camera.. \nMcCloy puts it to his eye, fumbles, then with Ambrose's direction: \nETHAN Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not happy about. \nMcCloy puts the camera down.  The two men have words.  McCloy shakily leave the table.  Ambrose opens the camera. \nLUTHER Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket... \nETHAN Left jacket pocket? \nLUTHER Roger that. \nETHAN Confirm.  Left jacket pocket. \nLUTHER Left jacket pocket confirmed. \nETHAN BY THE MOUNTING ENCLOSURE \nETHAN Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside -- \nNYAH -- his left jacket pocket. \nETHAN Affirmative. \nAMBROSE \npasses by Stamp on his way back, hands him the camera. \nNYAH (after a brief pause) Where do I meet you? \nETHAN Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this? \nNYAH I'll muddle through. \nWIDE ANGLE - BLEACHER (DAY) \nAmbrose arriving with a pair of drinks.  Nyah rises. \nAMBROSE See anything you like? \nNYAH Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou.. \nWhile Ambrose is still juggling the drinks, Nyah reaches into his trouser pockets, and rummages around. \nAMBROSE (laughing) Nyah! \nETHAN Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed. \nBILLY No worries, mate. \n", "test3_input": "The X-Ray microscope shows the individual seed-cells sticking together, some exploding, then all movement ceasing.

The yellow dot moves toward the red one as if drawn by a slow motion magnet. \nDOWN ANGLE - ETHAN \nlooking up as his entire body is hit with air like he's a wind tunnel.

Hands in gloves he reaches into the chamber for one of the injection guns. \nLUTHER'S VOICE He's still got three injection guns in the test lab..They're loaded with doses of Chimera which he'll destroy by firing into a hyper-thermal chamber. \nHe places the barrel of the gun, seals the chamber, and fires. There's a tiny flash of light.  Ethan withdraws the gun. \nINT - CONSTRUCTION VAN \nLuther's sweating it as the clock counts down:  :30, :29, :28.. \nLUTHER - twenty-seven, twenty-six, twenty-five, come on, Ethan we're almost there!  I-I'm off sensitive for this.. \nIn a spasm of anxiety Luther bolts to his feet, wipes his brow. \nLUTHER (cont'd) - eighteen seconds, the generators'll be off and Ethan's back on line.. \nLuther glances thru the van window only to see reflected in the van side mirror: \nMIRROR REFLECTION - CHROME BUMPER (EXT. CONSTRUCTION VAN) \nreflected in it is the face of a digital clock, its red LED illuminating the clock's numbers fourteen - thirteen - twelve - \nWITH LUTHER \nLUTHER (realizing what he's in for) Oh - oh - oh - \nEven as he moans he's frantically ripping out the computer and cords dangling, hotfoots toward the van exit. \nINT - HOT ZONE - GLASS OBSERVATION ROOM \nEthan fires the second injection gun.  Picks up the third and last.  He pauses as he's about to fire it, staring intently suddenly the gun is held by: \nNEKHORVICH \nwho turns the barrel from the hyper-thermal chamber and releases into his wrist. \nBACK TO ETHAN - GLASS OBSERVATION ROOM \nwhose vision of of Nekhorvich fades.  Still thinking of Nekhorvich he continues to stare at the gun for another moment and before he can fire: \nINT - SHEEP FARM IMF SAFEHOUSE \nThe bomb's LED readout shows 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1..

Ulrich hops back in pain. \nAMBROSE Those were two explosions, your van and your safehouse, in case you didn't hear them both -- I believe that means you've also lost a friend. \nEthan's crouching on the ground protected behind a series of vertical metal sheets. \nETHAN And you couldn't walk to tell me about it. \nEthan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the shattered glass on the floor.  Ambrose, Wallis, and a couple of other Ambrose team members fire, kicking up broken glass.  Ethan backs off. \nAMBROSE (yelling) Hold your fire, dammit! \nThe two spot one another in a mirror on the far wall of the hot zone.. \nAMBROSE (cont'd) Well, Hunt.  How've you been? \nETHAN (smiling) Fight a bit of a cold.. \nAMBROSE And you're happy about that? \nETHAN Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you. \nAMBROSE You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes. \nETHAN I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was. \nAMBROSE I knew where it was. \nETHAN Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for. \nEthan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a spray of gunfire, attempting to cover his own effort to the reach the injection gun.  The return fire nearly hits the injection gun, kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the floor. \nAMBROSE Stop!  Put a sock in it!  Hit that bloody gun and you'll spray the bloody virus all over the place! \nEverybody's regained cover but the injection gun remains out of everybody's reach. \nETHAN There it is, guys, the last of it. \nAMBROSE Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer. \nETHAN What was the top bid? \nAMBROSE Why, you going to make me a better offer? \nETHAN Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really. \nAMBROSE (not amused) Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl. \nNyah walks out into view on her own.  Ethan sees her reflection in the mirror.  Enraged, but trying to control it. \nETHAN She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go. \nAMBROSE She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer. \nA pregnant pause. \nLUTHER'S VOICE (breaking through the static) Ethan, Nyah's in the building!

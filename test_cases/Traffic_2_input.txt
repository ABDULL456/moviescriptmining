EXT. AYALA HOME - AFTERNOON 
Helena carries the cups down the driveway.  She presses a button and the gates swing open. 
INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - AFTERNOON 
Gordon and Castro listen to their headsets.  Suddenly -- 
VOICE (O.S.) (over their headsets) Okay.  She's coming out.  She's leaving her property.  Okay, she seems to be heading for the van! She is approaching the van! 
Castro and Gordon looks at each other. 
GORDON What do we do? 
CASTRO I don't know. 
There's a KNOCKING at the door of the van. 
GORDON What do you think she wants? 
CASTRO She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids. 
Gordon opens the door.  Helena is standing there with the lemonade. 
HELENA I so hope I didn't startle you.  I thought you might like some cold lemonade. 
GORDON Uh... Thank you. 
She hands the cups to him.  Helena gathers herself. 
HELENA I know this is a difficult situation and you're only doing your jobs.  I don't bear you any ill-will, but I do have a small favor to ask. 
CASTRO You want to ask us a favor? 
HELENA A man threatened my children. These charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the nut-jobs out of the nut jar. (beat) Would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary.  I don't know what else to do. 
GORDON Of course, we will. 
HELENA Thank you. 
They shut the door to the van and sit for a moment. 
CASTRO It's probably poisoned. 
Gordon takes a big sip of his. 
GORDON It's good.  Not too sweet.

EXT. TIJUANA STREET - MORNING 
This is a questionable neighborhood pushed up against the edge of poverty. 
Anna hurries across the street. 
EXT. JAVI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
Anna walks up the stairs of a rundown building.  She passes two PROSTITUTES loitering in the stairwell. 
She knocks on a door and Javi, half-dressed for work, answers. He's surprised to see her. 
JAVIER Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want? 
ANNA I can't find Manolo. 
JAVIER He's not here. 
ANNA He never came home last night.  Was he with you? 
JAVIER No. 
He lets her into the apartment. 
INT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
A small, clean room with a partition for the sleeping area. 
ANNA I'm worried.  Last time he was out late, I went through his clothes while he was asleep. 
She pulls out a plastic packet with the scorpion insignia and 911 stamped on it. 
Javier thinks a beat. 
JAVIER I'll find him. 
EXT. ALLEY - TIJUANA - DAY 
Javi slams Manolo against the side of building. 
JAVIER What the fuck are you doing? You're supposed to be at work. Look at you. 
Manolo is sweaty and crazy-eyed. 
MANOLO It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with. 
JAVIER Oh, really.  General Salazar was there? 
MANOLO No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us. 
JAVIER Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.

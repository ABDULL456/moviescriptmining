This film is a reenactment of actual events. It is based on Mr. Barris's private journals, public records, and hundreds of hours of taped interviews. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT 
SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981 
It's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street. 
INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS 
Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P" insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet); .38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays). 
GONG SHOW 
An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer. 
PERFORMER Why'd they do that? I wasn't done. 
BARRIS (AGE 50) I don't understand. Juice, why'd you gong this nice man? 
JAYE P. MORGAN Not to be.     That is the answer. 
The studio audience laughs. 
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT 
The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags. 
GONG SHOW 
Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points at it. 
BARRIS We'll be right back with more stuff. 
INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT 
The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes. The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands. The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change. 
THE GONG SHOW 
Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog. The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like "Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke. There is a knock at the door. 
BARRIS (mumbly) Fuck. Shit. Piss. 
Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge? Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty, young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in the background. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) (weakly) More stuff? 
BELLHOP Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you requested. Except I couldn't find a... (consults list) ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine. 
BARRIS Well, it's late. (mumbling and bowing) But thank you. Thank you for trying. You are a scholar and a... 
Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a scholar and a... 
Barris trails off. 
BELLHOP (eyes averted) Thank you, sir. 
Suddenly Barris becomes agitated. 
BARRIS Why are you not looking at me like that? Do I look ugly to you? (runs to the mirror) It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping, see. I have a lot on my... 
Barris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts to make conversation. 
BELLHOP (re: exploded tv) Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?

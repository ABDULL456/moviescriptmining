Digging. Sod coming off, being set aside on plastic. FLASH PHOTOS being taken. Stones being pried up... 
90   INT. CELLBLOCK - DAY                                              90 
Waiter and guards exit with the cart. The entire cellblock is SHOUTING. Iger pauses, gives a final glance back. Softly: 
IGER Idiot. 
Then he too departs, as: 
CLYDE 
aims his remote. MUSIC for dining. Clyde glances back at            * Dwight, who's poised and tense. 
CLYDE I suppose if I don't share, you'll beat the shit out of me. Make me squeal like a piggy. That sort of thing. 
DWIGHT Fuckin' A. 
Clyde motions "join me, won't you?" They each take a seat. 
Clyde passes Dwight a crisply-folded linen napkin. Dwight tucks it like a bib. Clyde lays his on his lap. 
A hurled object CLANGS off their bars. The cons are now throwing things, hollering to raise the dead. Clyde cranks the music a bit louder, motions for Dwight to dig in. 
Dwight goes for it, cramming food in his mouth and grabbing for more, fingers digging in... 
91   EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK                                               91 
...fingers digging in, pulling loose soil, prying stones. A layer of soil is brushed aside to reveal: 
A face. Embedded in the dirt. He's been there a long time. FLASH PHOTOS highlight desiccated lips and teeth... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       57. 
92   INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  92 
...lips and teeth -- Dwight chewing, laughing. Oddly enough, he and Clyde seem to have started enjoying each other's company. THE MUSIC PLAYS in bizarre counterpoint to:                * 
THE CACOPHONY of an angry cellblock -- if the cons weren't in their cells, this would be a riot. All imaginable items are being hurled through bars: toilet paper rolls, books, shoes, clothes, all raining down, showering the cellblock floor... 
CLYDE I wonder what the little people are eating tonight? 
Dwight throws his head back and laughs... 
93   INT. OFFICE - DUSK                                                93 
...while, in deep silence, Nick unwraps a sorry-looking deli sandwich, swaps his pickles for Cantrell's potato salad (their long-standing ritual). They both keep glancing at the phone... 
94   INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  94 
...as Clyde and Dwight indulge their food orgy. Dialogue is not important, so we won't hear any -- we'll let the MUSIC         * take over and carry -- because it's all about tone: 
They're laughing and talking, winding each other up. And the more Clyde wisecracks, the more Dwight laughs. 
Clyde finishes gnawing a lamb rack and says something to Dwight about the ruckus. Dwight turns, glances out, as: 
Clyde casually, but with purpose, lowers the bone onto his lap -- adding it to one already there. He picks up a fresh one, starts chewing the meat off... 
95   EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK                                               95 
Dark enough now for flashlights. In the beams, we see the body mostly excavated. Forensic team members gather, in gloves and breather masks, getting ready to try lifting. 
FORENSIC TECH Okay, let's see if we can get him out in one piece... 
ANGLE FINDS Davies at the helicopter, activity around him, holding Nick's card and dialing a cell phone... 
96   INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  96 
Clyde laughing, chewing, gnawing that third bone. ANGLE CLOSES DOWN as he brings it to his lap... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          58. 
TIGHT REVEAL: His napkin wrapped tightly around his hand provides padding for his palm. The two earlier bones are already held between his fingers -- he places the third, makes a fist -- and the bones now protrude from his clenched knuckles like a trio of spikes. 
TILT UP to Clyde...he reaches across, turns a paper plate over to cover the crepes... 
97    INT. OFFICE - DUSK                                                97 
The PHONE RINGS. Nick snatches it up. He listens, looks to Cantrell...nods. They found the body. 
98    EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK                                               98 
Behind Davies, B.G., the body's being extracted from the hole: 
FORENSIC TECH ...gently on three...one...two... 
DAVIES (on cell) --we'll have to wait for the autopsy results, but-- 
WHAM -- the GRAVE ERUPTS as HALF A DOZEN BURIED CLAYMORE MINES     * pop like firecrackers, knocking Davies forward...                  * 
99    INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  99 
...and Clyde lunges, face no longer laughing, the rolling cart slamming into the wall as the lamb bones protruding from his fist go slamming into Dwight's throat...

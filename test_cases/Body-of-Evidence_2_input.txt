JOANNE Yes. 
CARDENAS Tell the court about that, please. 
JOANNE I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial. 
CARDENAS Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death? 
JOANNE Yes. 
CARDENAS How did he look? 
JOANNE Horrible.  He was tired and pale. 
CARDENAS Did you talk about Miss Lawson? 
JOANNE Yes. 
CARDENAS What did Mr. Marsh say? 
JOANNE He was worried.  He said that she was acting stranger and stranger.  He said that if this kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. 
There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with genuine concern. 
CARDENAS Thank you. (to Dulaney) Your witness. 
Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards Joanne. 
DULANEY How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom? 
JOANNE What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial? 
DULANEY Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom? 
JOANNE Yes-- (thinks a moment) It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth. 
DULANEY Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death? 
JOANNE He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it. 
DULANEY Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile? 
JOANNE Yes -- he mentioned it. 
DULANEY So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress. 
JOANNE I suppose. 
DULANEY So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it. 
THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer. 
Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears confused. 
JOANNE I don't know.  I'm not sure. 
DULANEY Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible? 
JOANNE (begrudgingly) Yes.  I suppose it's possible. 
Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a sigh of relief. 
INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with Rebecca. 
REBECCA You were brilliant today. 
DULANEY It's only the beginning.

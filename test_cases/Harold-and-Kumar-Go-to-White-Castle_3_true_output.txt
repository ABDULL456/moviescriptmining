HAROLD (calm) Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car? 
KUMAR I think he did. 
HAROLD 
FUCK!!!!!! (to Kumar) You! You had to pick up a hitchhiker! 
KUMAR Rold, calm down! 
HAROLD Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?! 
KUMAR I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he'd fuck us over? 
HAROLD This is all your fault! This whole fucking night! You know I leased that car! They're gonna make me pay for it! Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store. 
KUMAR Where are you going? 
HAROLD I'm going to call the police!   I don't want to talk to you anymore! Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face. "Extremes" all around! 
KUMAR There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes.

Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street. On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him. 
KUMAR So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right? 
HAROLD I'm not speaking to you. Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY. 
KUMAR You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous. 
HAROLD Thank you, Mr. Wizard. HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again. 
HAROLD Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the left and then to the right. The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide. 
KUMAR This is ridiculous.   Just walk across. 
HAROLD It'll change in a second. They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change. 
KUMAR Come on, there's not a car in sight! 
HAROLD Alright fine. You want me to cross? I'll cross. Just leave me alone! Harold starts walking angrily across the street. 
KUMAR Finally.

Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a POLICE CAR FROM OUT OF 
NOWHERE FLASHES ITS LIGHTS AND STOPS HAROLD DEAD IN HIS 
TRACKS. 
HAROLD Shit! Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the car and walks over to them... 
HAROLD (looking at cop's name- tag) Good evening. Is there a problem, Officer...Palumbo? 
OFFICER PALUMBO Is there a problem? Ever hear of jaywalking? 
HAROLD Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never do it again. 
OFFICER PALUMBO Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing you up a ticket. OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket.    Kumar walks over, flabbergasted... 
KUMAR A ticket?!   Are you serious? Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!" 
OFFICER PALUMBO (to Kumar, unthreatened) Who the fuck are you, shitwad? 
HAROLD (stepping in front of Kumar) Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm glad you're here. You know the TV show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and... 
OFFICER PALUMBO Pipe down and give me your ID.

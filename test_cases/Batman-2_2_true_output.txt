PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. 
EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER 
The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages.  He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT 
MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up.  They're in for the long haul. 
The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS.  They carry it gingerly into the kitchen.  Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: 
GORDON Anything suspicious! 
In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. 
COP Nothing yet.  Christmas cards and bills. 
He anxiously watches their progress.  A VOICE calls from the kitchen. 
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? 
INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER 
GORDON enters.  The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table.  They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. 
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. 
He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. 
GORDON ...Have it analyzed. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT 
A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES.  His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. 
POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree?  The car's here. 
TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment.  Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. 
LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's.  I wanna stay here with Daddy. 
MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey.  Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. 
LITTLE GIRL She's old.  She doesn't even have cable. 
LITTLE BOY What about our presents? 
He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. 
TIPTREE Don't worry.  I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. 
TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids.  He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. 
GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. 
MRS. TIPTREE Kids?  Tell your Daddy goodbye... 
Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door.  TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. 
TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? 
GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. 
TIPTREE I told you.  I... 
TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes.  GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. 
GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. 
TIPTREE shakes his head wearily.  GORDON glowers as he turns to go. 
GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree.  Merry Christmas. 
GORDON exits.  TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS.  One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... 
...until a PHONE RINGS.  Everyone jumps at once.  A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... 
TIPTREE Hello...? 
VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree?  Andy here.  Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- 
The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. 
TIPTREE Not today, Andy.  Let's talk after New Year's. 
TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room.  The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. 
INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER.  He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope.  He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope.  He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. 
A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.

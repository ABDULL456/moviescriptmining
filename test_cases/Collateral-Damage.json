It's a tough job requiring strength, patience and determination. In a nutshell, that's Gordy. \nFirefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent, watches Gordy crank away. \nJUNIOR Hear the big news, Lieutenant? It's the twenty-first century.   We got electricity now. \nGordy keeps cranking. \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                                      2 \nJUNIOR Got these supermarkets, too.   Big places, freezers full o' ice cream. \nGordy stops.    Pops the lid.   Spoons out a dollop. \nGORDY Open up. \nHe sticks the spoon in Junior's mouth.      Junior eats. Junior loves it. Gordy smiles. \nGORDY Screw the twenty-first century. \nThe FIRE BELL SOUNDS. \n3   INT. FIREHOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                                  3 \nEveryone scrambles. The choreography's practiced, automatic. It's achieved without conversation. \nThe channel surfer slides down the fire pole.     He's followed by the man who was upstairs snoring. \nJunior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the printout to the snorer, the company's \"chauffeur.\" \nFeet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and hitched with suspenders. \nYellow jackets are whipped on. \nThe chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR. \nFirefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to the men over the headsets -- \nGORDY Second alarm. Multiple dwelling between Third and Lex. \n4   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - STREETS - NIGHT                           4 \nThe ENGINE SCREAMS and HONKS through the city. \n5   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - TENEMENT - NIGHT                          5 \nFLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy moves back to his company, who have already hooked the engine up to water. \nGORDY Top story's fully involved. We're supporting inside. Two lines up the stairs. \nHe points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE SHEA, a veteran firefighter of Irish descent. \nGORDY Junior and Mike -- \n", "test1_true": "GORDY -- Sal and Ronnie. \nThe chauffeur, ART WESTPHAL, German-Irish, stays with the engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two- man hose teams into... \n6   INT. TENEMENT                                                   6 \nGordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy hoses. Rats head past in the opposite direction, deserting the burning building. \n7   THIRD FLOOR                                                     7 \nThey meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water. Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants, using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and Mike, indicates \"up.\" Begins leading the hose team up the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning -- \nGORDY Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall. \n8   FOURTH FLOOR                                                    8 \nThey reach the fourth floor.    There's fire everywhere. And then... (CONTINUED) \n8    CONTINUED:                                                    8 \nThey see a FIREFIGHTER from the other company. He has fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages around him. To Junior and Mike -- \nGORDY Knock it back! \nThey turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris, can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe. \nChunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again. \nGordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter. Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more, until... \nMike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the firefighter. \nFIREFIGHTER #1 Two floors up. I heard screaming... Couldn't get there. \nGORDY Where? \nFIREFIGHTER #1 End of the hall. \n9    GORDY                                                         9 \ntakes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears the FAINT sound of SCREAMING. \n10   NEW ANGLE                                                     10 \nGordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts running. He's gonna jump it. \nGordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first. Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and... \n(CONTINUED) \n10   CONTINUED:                                                     10 \nGordy swings over the hole on the axe handle. \nHe hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into the door at the end of the hall. \n11   INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT                                        11 \nGordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back. \nGordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead. \nGordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire. \n12   INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY                                        12 \nGordy calls down to his men. \nGORDY Give me the hose! \nMIKE This place is gone! It could flashover any second! \nGORDY Give me the goddamn hose! \nBeat.   Mike and Junior pass the hose up. \n13   INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT                                        13 \nGordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the ceiling. Turns it on full jet. \nGordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure stream bites into old, decayed plaster. \nBit by bit the ceiling falls away.       Gordy's almost through to the room above, when... \nFalling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure. He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down. He's gotta get outta there. \nGordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe.       Attacks the hole again furiously, until finally... \n14   GORDY                                                         14 \nbreaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens, to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up. Speaks to them in Spanglish -- \nGORDY It's okay... Esta bien, esta bien... Come with me... Con mio... \n15   INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY                                         15 \nGordy lowers the family through the floor hole. \n16   EXT. TENEMENT                                                 16 \nGordy carries the family's small child outside. He passes the child to its grateful parents, while... \nThe rescued Firefighter sits on a curb looking at a hero and shaking his head in disbelief and admiration. \n17   INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            17 \nANNE PITT, thirties, reaches out and KILLS the ALARM. She rolls over. The other half of the bed's empty. We hear a CHILD'S VOICE from another room. \n18   INT. MATT'S BEDROOM                                           18 \n", "test1_id": 237, "test2_input": "He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in. \nGordy's not gonna go down easy, though. \nEven as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way. He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's four men trying to tackle a bull, and... \nThe bull gets away. \n130   EXT./INT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                      130 \nGordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit. \n131   GORDY                                                          131 \njukes into a local bar. \n132   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  132 \nGordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered courtyard, where he's surrounded by ten-foot walls. \n133   FEDERALES                                                      133 \nblast through the bar. \n134   GORDY                                                          134 \nruns, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and... \n135   TOP OF WALL                                                    135 \nHe reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up. He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step thundering, as... \n136   FEDERALES                                                      136 \nburst into the courtyard.

The building is dark and dusty. He lies still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice, pulls them over him. \n140   FEDERALE                                                      140 \non the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite. \n141   GORDY                                                         141 \nsees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath. Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof. And Gordy can breathe again. \n142   EXT. MOMPOS STREET - NIGHT                                    142 \nGordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier town. A noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels. Everyone's packing a gun. A new Dodge City, where death squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's BLARING SALSA. \n143   INT. TROPICALE - NIGHT                                        143 \nIn here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of local \"hostesses\" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the other. \nGordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when... \nThe girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly, revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but now Gordy can see the \"Deerborn\" logo clearly. \nGordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap. It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts toward the girl, when... \nGordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving in on him. \nGordy moves faster toward the girl.   And... \nThe girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab, and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics. \nThe thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy. \nGordy's almost to the hat. \n(CONTINUED) \n143   CONTINUED:                                                    143 \nArmstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's spoon. \nARMSTRONG I never met a nose I couldn't hang a spoon on. \nGordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back, when... \nA strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too, wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose. \nARMSTRONG Yahtzee! \nAnd now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat Federale addresses Gordy -- \nFAT FEDERALE Come along, Mr. Pitt. \nWhereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy -- \nARMSTRONG Police catch you trying to steal my hat, you asshole?! \nHe staggers toward Gordy.    Grabs the hat. \nARMSTRONG Fucking hat thief! \nArmstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but... \n", "test2_true": "ARMSTRONG Get outta here -- \nBut then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts surprise the Armstrong neural network. \nGordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when... \nThe Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just behind the ear... And Gordy gets to know the floor, too. \n144   EXT. MOMPOS JAIL - NIGHT                                          144 \nThe building's ancient, constructed of wood and adobe. \n145   INT. MOMPOS JAIL - CELL - NIGHT                                   145 \nThe jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough. They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant. \nGordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales. The Fat Federale has Armstrong's hat. He looks it over, wondering why Gordy wanted it. Then decides he could give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong. Clangs the cell door shut and locks it. Leaves shaking his head. \nFAT FEDERALE Gringos... \nArmstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on the metal bunk. \nARMSTRONG That stun gun wasn't cool. \nArmstrong looks down at himself. \nARMSTRONG Haven't peed my pants in a real long time. \nGORDY (beat) You shouldn't have helped me. \nARMSTRONG Yeah, well, I guess all these assholes down here are just starting on my nerves. \nGordy's silent.   It's over.   He's come up short.   He's going home. \nARMSTRONG So what the hell did you do to land us in here? And don't jerk me around, eh? \nBeat.   Gordy sits. \nGORDY The Wolf killed my wife and son in New York. \n(CONTINUED) \n145   CONTINUED:                                                      145 \nARMSTRONG ... Oh, you're that guy, eh? I'm sorry, man... And what, you came down here to even things out? \nGordy just looks at him. \nARMSTRONG Did you even have a plan? \nGORDY Yeah. Go to Caguan, find The Wolf and kill him. \nArmstrong just shakes his head.    Beat. \n146   DOOR TO CELL AREA                                               146 \nBANGS open. Federales lead in two men -- the two guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged infiltrators. The federales are armed with batons and stun guns, taking no chances. It's clear the rebels weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face- first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the cell. A solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and Armstrong. Armstrong's seen the patches on their uniforms. To Gordy, sotto -- \nARMSTRONG E.L.C. \nBeat. Armstrong sees the look on Gordy's face.      By way of a warning -- \nARMSTRONG If you can't kill them, don't even talk to them. \nThe GUERRILLAS are MURMURING in the other cell. One of them LAUGHS. OFF Gordy, listening to the LAUGHING... \n147   INT. GORDY AND ARMSTRONG'S CELL - NIGHT                         147 \nTwo or three A.M. Armstrong's dozing. Gordy's still listening to the MURMURING of the REBELS on the other side of the wall, when... \n(CONTINUED) \n147   CONTINUED:                                                    147 \nThere's a flurry of activity outside the cell area.   The door opens. Soldiers enter with some federales. \nGordy watches the soldiers move past his cell.    Rocha is with them. And then... \nBrandt appears at the bars, looks in at Gordy. \nBRANDT Enjoy your trip? \nGordy stands, approaches. \nBRANDT We asked you to leave it to us. \nGORDY And you guys still haven't got him. \nBRANDT It's not over yet... The guys next door are in The Wolf's elite bodyguard unit. Where he goes, they go. We're gonna ask questions. And we're gonna get answers... And you're staying right here till our bomber's dead. \nBrandt goes. Moments later, a TORTURED SCREAM is heard on the other side of the brick wall, waking Armstrong with a start. \n148   EXT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                           148 \nIn a field near Mompos, a canopied truck backs into position. Men in guerrilla uniforms with ELC patches get out and pull back the canopy, revealing mortar tubes pointing skyward on a bed of sand. \n149   ELC GUERRILLA                                                 149 \nunit armed with AK-47s and Light Anti-Tank Weapons (LAWs) infiltrates the town. \n150   ANOTHER TWO-MAN ELC GUERRILLA TEAM                            150 \nsets up a single mortar position overlooking the town. One of the men checks his watch. Beat. He signals. The other man drops a MORTAR down the tube. WHUMP. \n151   TWO MORTARS                                                    151 \ngo in the tubes on the truck.

Puts the rubber bands around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand, holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then... \nSlowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring- loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now, Gordy's going up in the blast. \nGordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it. \nGordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers. And...

Gordy squeezes out as much as he can onto them. \nThen Gordy gets the hell out of there.   He finds cover. Ducks down.

He looks in the direction of the sound, and... \nGordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish. \nGordy's eyes flash with alarm.

Angrily punts Gordy again. \nTHE WOLF You think you can kill The Wolf?! \nA boot in the face this time. \nTHE WOLF You think you can kill The Wolf?! \nA piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets and fluttered to the ground nearby. The woman picks it up, and we see... \nIt's the photo of Anne and Matt. \nThe woman stares at the photo a moment, as... \nGordy absorbs another blow.    He tries to stand. \nGORDY You killed my wife and son -- \nWhack! The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against Gordy's skull. Gordy drops hard. The Wolf reverses the AK. Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the trigger, when... \nThe Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm. \nWOMAN Claudio. \nThe Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy.    The Woman squeezes his arm. Implores him -- \nWOMAN Claudio. \n(CONTINUED) \n261   CONTINUED:                                                     261 \nThe Wolf glances over. Meets her eyes a moment. Sees the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again. They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy -- \nTHE WOLF You were just saved by your guardian angel. \n262   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY                                  262 \nDark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light. \nGordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked -- but the physical aches are nothing compared to the anguish he feels for having failed. \nThe door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards. He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy. \nTHE WOLF One of the men in the jail with you in Mompos is dying. He was burned in your explosion. \nGordy just looks at him. \nThe Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and frees his leg from the chain. \nTHE WOLF You want to kill me? Come and kill me. \nThe bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then springs for The Wolf, and... \nThe Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right away... and The Wolf drops him again. \nTHE WOLF You Americans think you have all the answers. And really, you're so naive... \n(CONTINUED) \n262   CONTINUED:                                                       262 \nGordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him. \nTHE WOLF ... You see one peasant with a gun, and you never ask why he has to have it. You just run to give your billions to the nearest soldiers, no matter how merciless or corrupt they are. \nThe last kick really hurt Gordy.    He's slow rising. \nTHE WOLF That's why I'm teaching America a lesson... that's why there'll be more bombs... and more families like yours will pay the price. \nThe Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard. Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall. Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen. All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when... \nA bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys. Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to his midsection. And then... \nHe makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor. \n263   BLACK                                                            263 \nwe hear a gentle CLACKING sound.

She's sitting on the metal bed frame nursing Gordy's wounds. The CLACKING sound CONTINUES -- it's made by SEA SHELLS that dangle from a bracelet on Selena's wrist. The shells knock together as she washes Gordy's wounds. \n(CONTINUED) \n264   CONTINUED:                                                           264 \nSELENA Are you alright? \n265   INT.

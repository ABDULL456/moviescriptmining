It's a tough job requiring strength, patience and determination. In a nutshell, that's Gordy. \nFirefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent, watches Gordy crank away. \nJUNIOR Hear the big news, Lieutenant? It's the twenty-first century.   We got electricity now. \nGordy keeps cranking. \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                                      2 \nJUNIOR Got these supermarkets, too.   Big places, freezers full o' ice cream. \nGordy stops.    Pops the lid.   Spoons out a dollop. \nGORDY Open up. \nHe sticks the spoon in Junior's mouth.      Junior eats. Junior loves it. Gordy smiles. \nGORDY Screw the twenty-first century. \nThe FIRE BELL SOUNDS. \n3   INT. FIREHOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                                  3 \nEveryone scrambles. The choreography's practiced, automatic. It's achieved without conversation. \nThe channel surfer slides down the fire pole.     He's followed by the man who was upstairs snoring. \nJunior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the printout to the snorer, the company's \"chauffeur.\" \nFeet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and hitched with suspenders. \nYellow jackets are whipped on. \nThe chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR. \nFirefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to the men over the headsets -- \nGORDY Second alarm. Multiple dwelling between Third and Lex. \n4   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - STREETS - NIGHT                           4 \nThe ENGINE SCREAMS and HONKS through the city. \n5   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - TENEMENT - NIGHT                          5 \nFLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy moves back to his company, who have already hooked the engine up to water. \nGORDY Top story's fully involved. We're supporting inside. Two lines up the stairs. \nHe points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE SHEA, a veteran firefighter of Irish descent. \nGORDY Junior and Mike -- \nAnne opens the door to find an exhausted Gordy sitting on the floor with their four-year-old son, MATT. They're building a K'nex spaceship. \nMATT Look what we made! \nANNE Nice rocket... That took a while. \nGORDY He was awake when I got home.   His throat still hurts. \nANNE Shit. \nMATT That's a bad word. \nGORDY You're right. (CONTINUED) \n18   CONTINUED:                                                        18 \nANNE Sorry. \nShe feels Matt's forehead.    Gordy's done it already. \nGORDY No fever. \nANNE (to Matt) You better see Dr. Bob. (to Gordy) And this time, no opening fire hydrants to play in till he's completely well. \nGORDY Yes, ma'am. \nShe leans down and kisses him.      There's passion in it. \nANNE How was your shift? \nGORDY (shrugs) The usual. \nShe yawns.    Starts heading out. \nANNE Dreamed I did a triple axel in an ice skating championship. \nGORDY (beat; calls after her) Come back and let me see those legs again. \n19   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                               19 \nGordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them. It's the second child he's held in the last few hours. This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child. We see the deep affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head... \nAnne opens the shower door.       She's on the phone. \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:                                                      19 \nANNE Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at twelve. I have a patient relations meeting at twelve- fifteen. Can you take him? \nGORDY I have a game. But yeah, if we do the handoff at the doctor's. \nANNE (into phone) Yes, he'll be there... Thanks. (hangs up; to Gordy) Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's. Don't be late. (to Matt) Let's get you out, sweetie. Your father just can't keep you dry. \nShe leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds... \nTwo bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing -- \n20   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                    20 \nIt appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League. \nGordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his lungs. \nThe rivalry's intense. The game close.       The noise deafening. Bets are going down. \nNYFD goes up by one in the final minute. \nGordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team. \nLUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting, devastated at missing the easy \"two.\" Gordy yells at him to defend. \nGORDY Luis, get back! Pick up your man! \n(CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED:                                                  20 \nLuis shakes it off. Hustles back on \"D\" as his man gets the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins. \n21   SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER                 21 \nIn the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating around them. Gordy's proud of Luis. \nGORDY We lose, win, whatever. But one thing we never do. We never, ever give up. Right? \nOFF Gordy, smiling at Luis... \n22   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          22 \nThe crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts off, when a SOUND draws his attention. \n23   GORDY'S POV                                                 23 \nLuis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the fence, clearly trying to intimidate him. \n24   BACK TO SCENE                                               24 \nGordy stalks walking toward them.    Calls -- \nGORDY Luis... \nSeeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off. Reaching Luis -- \nGORDY What was that about? \nLUIS Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em anymore. \nBut Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to go. \nThere's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air, tumbling, then smacks to the ground. \nGordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris. Then struggles to his hands and knees. \nGORDY Anne! \nHe tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a large shard of glass embedded in his leg. \nPeople come to help him, but Gordy only cares about finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but can't see them, when... \nHis eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement. \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:                                                     44 \nGordy screams out his agony -- \nGORDY Noooooo!!! \n45   EXT. COLOMBIAN CONSULATE                                       45 \nThe blast detonated here. Some men from the Navigators are dead. MIKE BRANDT is not. Rises from the devastation, gun in hand, as SIRENS wail in the distance. \n46   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - LATER                                  46 \nEmergency personnel - EMS, NYPD, NYFD -- swarm the area. \nTwo white plastic sheets cover two bodies. \nAcross the street, PARAMEDICS work on Gordy's leg. \nPARAMEDIC #1 We're gonna give you a shot. \nGordy's oblivious to the pain.     Shoves him away. \nGORDY I need to see them! \nPARAMEDIC #1 We gotta help you right now. \nPARAMEDIC #2 We've done all we can for 'em, Gordy. \n47   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  47 \nFBI agent JOE PHIPPS ducks under the police tape.     REGGIE DRAY, a young agent, meets him. As they walk -- \nDRAY Device functioned in front of the Colombian Consulate just as a motorcade full of brass arrived. \nPHIPPS Who were the brass, and why were they here? \n(CONTINUED) \n47   CONTINUED:                                                     47 \nDRAY No one's talking yet, but it smells high-level. There were Colombians and Americans in the cars. Three of 'em ate it. Guy on the phone -- \nHe indicates Brandt, talking on a cell phone. \nDRAY -- is one of the survivors. Name's Brandt. C.I.A. \nThat gets Phipps' interest momentarily. Then, as they continue toward the consulate, he notices security cameras on the building. \nPHIPPS Check the surveillance cameras? \nDRAY We're pulling up the video now. \nPHIPPS (stops; looks around) Where's N.Y.P.D. on this? \nDRAY They know it's ours. They're helping with shoe-leather. \nPhipps' eyes go to the white sheets up the street. \nDRAY We got two dead bystanders, a mother and four-year-old son. The father's over there with a leg wound. (indicates Gordy) Guy's a lieutenant with the New York F.D. \nPHIPPS Anybody talk to him yet? \nDRAY We've been giving him room. \n48   BACK TO GORDY                                                  48 \nIn b.g., Mike, the veteran firefighter in Gordy's engine company, looks under the sheets with a cop. \n(CONTINUED) \n48   CONTINUED:                                                     48 \nJunior puts a gentle hand on Gordy's shoulder. \nJUNIOR Gordy. \nGordy looks up him, meets his eyes. \nJUNIOR Me and Mike are here. \nGORDY ... I was late... They shouldn't have been there... \nJUNIOR It's not your fault. \nGORDY I need to see them. \nMike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on Gordy. \nMIKE No. You don't need to see 'em that way, Gordo. \nJunior spots a news camera crew focusing on Gordy's grief, calls at a cop. \nJUNIOR Get those goddamn people outta here! \nPhipps, approaching with Dray, addresses the same cop. \nPHIPPS ... Mike was in the motorcade that day... He's the chief U.S. intelligence officer overseeing Colombia. \nBRANDT Don't worry, Mr. Pitt, we're gonna get the son-of-a-bitch. \nGORDY You know where he is? \nBRANDT We believe The Wolf's in hiding in an area of Colombia controlled by the E.L.C., extreme Marxist guerrillas... He thinks he's in a safe haven. \nBrandt lets \"thinks\" sink in. \nPHIPPS I know it's hard for you right now, Mr. Pitt. We're all sorry. But why don't you go home. We're taking care of things. \nBeat.   Brandt proffers a business card. \nBRANDT Here's my card. Call me any time. \nGordy takes it.    Just sits there a long moment, then -- \nGORDY What kind of twisted people do things like this? \nBeat.   Brandt and Phipps don't have an answer. \n69   INT. NEW YORK TIMES - BULLPEN - DAY                        69 \nGordy talks to a Latin reporter, ERNIE OROSCO. \nOROSCO You interested in the big picture or all the unpleasant details? \nGORDY My family died because of what's going on down there. I want to know all I can. \nOrosco searches for a starting point.   Then -- \nOROSCO Well, basically, the situation in Colombia sucks... \nAs Orosco continues... \n70   MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT                                        70 \nOver the course of a week: \n1. Gordy takes pictures, etc., off a wall in his home. He pins up photos of Anne and Matt at the top of the wall. Beneath them he pins up a large map of Colombia. \nOROSCO (V.O.) ... The government's been fighting different Marxists factions for over thirty-five years. For most of that time, it was winning... \n71   NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY                                    71 \n2. At the New York Public Library, Gordy uses microfilm files and computer access to the web to search out information on Colombia and The Wolf. \nOROSCO (V.O.) ... Suddenly the guerrillas began chopping 'em up. High-tech weapons and equipment, well- trained troops, aggressive hit- and-run tactics, all financed by extortion, kidnapping and collecting taxes from dope growers. It's big money, and they put it to use... \n72   GORDY                                                          72 \n3. Gordy pins up various Colombia-related articles and pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post. \nOROSCO (V.O.) ... The government got scared. In 1998, to jump start peace talks, it gave a coalition of guerrilla groups temporary control over much of southern Colombia... The first communist stronghold on an American continent... \n73   GORDY                                                          73 \n4.   Gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone. \nOROSCO (V.O.) ... But there've been few talks and no peace. And the Colombian military can't get near the guerrilla zone, especially around the town of Caguan, where the E.L.C. kicks ass and takes no prisoners... \n74   GORDY                                                          74 \n5.   Gordy circles and labels the ELC-controlled area. \nOROSCO (V.O.) ... And that's where we come in. Supposedly, to help eliminate narcos operating in the guerrilla zone. But some well-informed people think that's just an excuse to hit the guerrillas themselves, since they're wrapped around the drug trade... We're there, we're involved... If we stay, the only real question is which Vietnam War we're gonna have. The one some feel we could've won or the one we lost... \n75   GORDY                                                          75 \n6. Gordy watches a documentary about Colombia which shows rebels, army troops, death squads, firefights, and with atrocities and bodies on both sides. \n(CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:                                                         75 \nOROSCO (V.O.) ... Bottom line? The place is as dangerous as a snakepit. You've got the different guerrilla groups, C.I.A., F.B.I., D.E.A., Colombian military, U.S. military, right- wing death squads -- and the only thing they've all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people... Hey, I'm Colombian, and I'll never go back... \nOFF Gordy's packed wall... \n76   SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY                                           76 \nAs Gordy closes the front door, REVEAL Mike, the firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this must have required. \nMIKE Haven't heard from you in a couple days. \nGORDY Been busy. \nMIKE Yeah.   I can see that. \nGordy's obsessed, totally consumed by his project.      He points at a picture of heavily-armed guerrillas. \nGORDY E.L.C. attack platoon... These assholes kill innocent people all the time in Colombia. \nGordy indicates a newspaper article. \nGORDY Thirteen dead in a bus. (indicates another) A market. Twenty-seven dead. (another) A whole family... Anne and Matt didn't mean shit to them. (indicates The Wolf) Or him. \nMike interrupts, trying to divert him to something else. \n(CONTINUED) \n76   CONTINUED:                                                           76 \nMIKE Hey, we never turned down free beer, and rookie's buying, you believe that? He certified today, he's off probation. \nGORDY (still looking at wall) Ronnie couldn't find a fire with both hands. \nMIKE (smiles) Yeah.   Let's go tell him that. \nwe see a CNN anchor with an over-the-shoulder graphic showing the still of the cop from the consulate surveillance camera with \"The Wolf\" superimposed. \nCNN ANCHOR (V.O.) ... videotape from the terrorist who calls himself The Wolf... \nOn screen, we now see a homemade video of a masked figure wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunter's mesh face mask with a strange-smiling face painted on it in camo earth tones. The Wolf's body is hidden shadow, the voice digitally altered to a deep bass growl. \nTHE WOLF (V.O.) You thought you killed me. You didn't. I'm still here... \nWe see Gordy's demeanor shift, retreating to the obsessive, seething hatred he showed before. \n(CONTINUED) \n83    CONTINUED:                                                      83 \nTHE WOLF (V.O.) ... I swear that for every freedom fighter you killed, ten Americans will die. And I will pick the time and the place. And I will enjoy it... \nThe Wolf slaps his palm for emphasis. \nTHE WOLF (V.O.) ... Venceremos. \nThe tape ends.    Mike shakes his head. \nMIKE This guy, Quaddafi, that Bin Laden... We never get these assholes. \nOFF Gordy, his spark of life suddenly extinguished... \n83A   EXT. ROW OF TOWNHOUSES (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY                 83A \nThe four connected townhouses sit behind gates on a tree- lined street in Georgetown. A sign reads: Latin American Institute. \n83B   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - BRANDT'S OFFICE - DAY       83B \nBrandt's on the phone.    He's pissed. \nBRANDT ... Senator, the failure of one operation shouldn't cause your committee to question financing everything else we're doing down there... \nDONALD UPDEGRAF, Brandt's number two, enters. \nBRANDT ... I know it looks bad, and I appreciate your support. Together we'll get it done... Yeah. 'bye. (hangs up; to Updegraf) Without his father's money, that asshole'd be keeping bees for a living... What? \n(CONTINUED) \n83B   CONTINUED:                                                         83B \nUPDEGRAF Gordy Pitt's on the phone. \nBRANDT No. \nUPDEGRAF He's called every day. \nBRANDT I don't need it. \nBeat.   Updegraf picks up the phone. \nUPDEGRAF Mr. Pitt, Mr. Brandt'll have to get back to you. \n84    INT. GORDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                         84 \nGordy's mood is dark. It's not improved by hearing the bullshit in Updegraf's reply. \nGORDY Tell him not to bother. \nHe slams down the phone. Rips up Brandt's business card. He's alone with his frustration, with his rekindled hatred and rage. OFF Gordy, glaring at the photo of The Wolf on his wall... \n85    INT. AEROPUERTO EL DORADO (BOGOTA) - IMMIGRATION AND               85 CUSTOMS AREA - DAY \nArmed police lead Rottweilers through the newly-arrived passengers. FIND Gordy in line. He wears jeans, polo shirt, Timberlands, carries a backpack. \nGordy advances to an IMMIGRATION OFFICER, hands over his documents. The agent studies Gordy's passport. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER Business or pleasure, senor? \nGORDY ... Pleasure. \nThe agent looks up at Gordy.         Looks back at the passport. Beat. \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                         85 \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER One moment, senor. \nThe agent gets the attention of an IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR, and the two of them confer out of earshot a moment. The Superior looks over at Gordy. Then approaches. \nIMMIGRATION SUPERIOR If you would come with me, please. \n86   INT. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS - OFFICE - DAY                        86 \nGORDY Is there a problem? \nThe customs Superior closes the door.      Beat. \nIMMIGRATION SUPERIOR We know who you are, Mr. Pitt. \nGORDY Says so right there in my passport. \nIMMIGRATION SUPERIOR We're aware your wife and child were killed in the bombing in New York. (off Gordy's look) We have C.N.N. here, too. (then) It's better for you to visit another country. For your own sake. \nGORDY ... You giving me a choice? \nIMMIGRATION SUPERIOR Yes. But not about staying in Colombia. \nHe opens the door, addresses two armed policemen in Spanish. Turning back to Gordy -- \nIMMIGRATION SUPERIOR These men will escort you onto whatever flight you wish. \nHe holds out Gordy's passport.     Beat.   Gordy takes it, starts out. As he goes -- \n(CONTINUED) \nThe little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people to flee for their lives, and... \nJust as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he now steps over the line and advances into Colombia. \n94   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT         94 \nWhere the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia. \nDarkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill.    At night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When... \nEVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return. \nAs Gordy walks on... \n95   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING                      95 \nThe sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a break in the trees, sees a small town ahead. \n96    NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER                                         96 \nGordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the bandage, revealing... \nA wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound. \nGordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and photo inside the bandage. \n97    BACK ON TRAIL                                                  97 \nGordy heads into the town. \n98    EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT                                        98 \nOne of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that ply Colombia's back-country roads. \nAs the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the small-statured Colombians pressed in around him. \n99    EXT. FINCA (COLOMBIA) - DAY                                    99 \nA sprawling farm/estate deep in the countryside. Beyond the hacienda, we see a military compound containing tents and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters. A recently arrived Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) sits on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning. \n100   INT. HACIENDA - DAY                                            100 \nFull of manned hi-tech command-and-control and surveillance equipment. A Colombian military operations officer, ROCHA, waits with an aide. \nBrandt arrives with Updegraf. \nBRANDT Find your fucking leak? \nROCHA Not yet. And it could be your fucking leak. \n(CONTINUED) \n100   CONTINUED:                                                      100 \nBRANDT All due respect, Noel, it's not likely... And we don't need the whole world looking into what we're doing down here... We find the son-of-a-bitch again, we're bypassing protocols... \nUpdegraf has had papers handed to him and interrupts -- \nUPDEGRAF Check this out. \nHe hands a paper to Brandt.    Brandt reads it. \nBRANDT Jesus Christ... \nUPDEGRAF (to Rocha) The man whose wife and son died in New York. One of your units found his passport and credit cards on some gunrunners near Panama. Gunrunners say they left him alive. \nBRANDT What, he thinks he can get The Wolf himself? \nROCHA We have too much time and too many people invested to have a loose cannon walking around. \nBRANDT (beat; hands papers to Rocha) Throw out the net. Have him picked up... Just make sure no one kills him. \nFLASH-CUT TO: \n101   EXPLOSION                                                       101 \nBoom!   An ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.      And... \n102   EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT                                         102 \nGordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream. He looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus, unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his bearings. The dream lingers, depressing him. \n103   ANGLE - AHEAD OF CHIVA                                          103 \nAn oncoming bus flashes its headlights. As the buses pass, the ONCOMING DRIVER yells to Gordy's chiva driver. \nONCOMING DRIVER Inspecion militar. Chequeo de papeles. \n104   SECOND CHIVA                                                    104 \nkeeps going. Gordy's chiva slows to a crawl, and the Driver calls back. \nGORDY'S CHIVA DRIVER Inspecion militar. Chequeo de papeles. \nVarious passengers gather their things and begin to disembark in a hurry. To anyone who'll answer -- \nGORDY Habla Ingles?... Que pasa? \nA MAN IN A YANKEES CAP is among the people getting off. He answers in accented English. \nMAN IN YANKEES CAP There is a military checkpoint up the road. They inspect everyone's papers. \n105   BUS                                                             105 \nstarts to pick up speed again. Gordy gets off just in time. To the Man in the Yankees Cap -- \nGORDY Where are all of you going? \nMAN IN YANKEES CAP We walk around. \nGORDY Guerrilla bastards. \nMAN IN YANKEES CAP No... Military... To stop guerrillas. \nBeat.   Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees... \n117   YOUNG MAN                                                      117 \nhas left the group and emerged from the river in a different place to avoid the mines. \nGordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground. The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts -- \nGORDY No!   Alto! \nThe young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and stops... But not before he plants his next step, and... \nThe trip wire bows against his shin, and... \nGordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and... \nNothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen in position, his leg still bowing the line. \n(CONTINUED) \n117   CONTINUED:                                                    117 \nUsing the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca- Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection, Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade. There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to explode at chest level... And the can's almost off. \nGordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade. \n118   MAN IN YANKEES CAP - MOMENTS LATER                            118 \nWhen Gordy returns, the man's dead.    OFF Gordy, looking down at the NY logo on the cap... \n119   EXT./INT. ANOTHER CHIVA - DAY                                 119 \nGordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along. \nHe pulls out his map. \n120   INSERT - MAP                                                  120 \nGordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He traces a road from the town. The road runs south through the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the ELC capital. \n121   BACK TO SCENE                                                 121 \nA COLOMBIAN WOMAN is looking over Gordy's shoulder. \nCOLOMBIAN WOMAN No autobusses para este lugar. Solamente el barco en el rio. \nShe leans over, traces the river, which also runs to Caguan. \nCOLOMBIAN WOMAN El rio. \n122   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                         122 \nThe FERRY'S WHISTLE TOOTS.    Lines are cast off. \n(CONTINUED) \n122   CONTINUED:                                                      122 \nTwo plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry load and now relax their vigil. One man holds a Xerox of Gordy's passport photo. The other bites into an empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down the front of his shirt. His partner finds it funny. He doesn't. And while their attention's occupied... \nGordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence, and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away. \n123   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                123 \nThe ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's packed. Gordy picks his way through. The only other gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme hat that says \"Deerborn.\" The geek, PHILIP ARMSTRONG, looks like a talker, and Gordy tries to avoid eye contact. He's too late. \nARMSTRONG Hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man! \nGORDY No, that's okay -- \nBut Armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench. \nARMSTRONG I was hoping for someone I could communicate with. \nHe sees Gordy hasn't moved. \nARMSTRONG Only room's at the back near the bano, and I'd advise against it, unless you like poop. \nBeat.   Gordy sits.   Immediately -- \nARMSTRONG Philip Armstrong. Assiniboia, Sasketchewan, Canada. (indicates his hat) Deerborn Heavy Equipment. \nGORDY ... Gordy Pitt. \nARMSTRONG Hey, howya doing? I love Germany. \n(CONTINUED) \n123   CONTINUED:                                                     123 \nGORDY Austria.   American now. \nARMSTRONG I love America. Never been to Austria. Where from in America would that be? \nGORDY New York City. \nARMSTRONG I don't like New York City. Buildings're too big. What kinda work you in? \nGORDY (hesitates, then) Coffee. I buy beans. \nARMSTRONG Can't drink caffeine. Makes my stomach do the rumba. I like that commercial guy with the sombrero and the mule, though. Headed upstream, eh? Where to? \nGORDY Caguan. \nARMSTRONG ... You've never been to Caguan, eh? \nHe clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in. \nGordy's not gonna go down easy, though. \nEven as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way. He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's four men trying to tackle a bull, and... \nThe bull gets away. \n130   EXT./INT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                      130 \nGordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit. \n131   GORDY                                                          131 \njukes into a local bar. \n132   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  132 \nGordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered courtyard, where he's surrounded by ten-foot walls. \n133   FEDERALES                                                      133 \nblast through the bar. \n134   GORDY                                                          134 \nruns, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and... \n135   TOP OF WALL                                                    135 \nHe reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up. He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step thundering, as... \n136   FEDERALES                                                      136 \nburst into the courtyard. Two men hastily build a stack of boxes, etc., against the wall. \n137   GORDY                                                          137 \nruns as fast as he can across the rooftops, when... \nA section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as... \n138   NEW ANGLE                                                      138 \nOne of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks across the rooftops... and Gordy's gone. \n139   GORDY                                                          139 \nlands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans and coffee. The building is dark and dusty. He lies still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice, pulls them over him. \n140   FEDERALE                                                      140 \non the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite. \n141   GORDY                                                         141 \nsees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath. Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof. And Gordy can breathe again. \n142   EXT. MOMPOS STREET - NIGHT                                    142 \nGordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier town. A noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels. Everyone's packing a gun. A new Dodge City, where death squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's BLARING SALSA. \n143   INT. TROPICALE - NIGHT                                        143 \nIn here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of local \"hostesses\" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the other. \nGordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when... \nThe girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly, revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but now Gordy can see the \"Deerborn\" logo clearly. \nGordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap. It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts toward the girl, when... \nGordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving in on him. \nGordy moves faster toward the girl.   And... \nThe girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab, and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics. \nThe thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy. \nGordy's almost to the hat. \n(CONTINUED) \n143   CONTINUED:                                                    143 \nArmstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's spoon. \nARMSTRONG I never met a nose I couldn't hang a spoon on. \nGordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back, when... \nA strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too, wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose. \nARMSTRONG Yahtzee! \nAnd now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat Federale addresses Gordy -- \nFAT FEDERALE Come along, Mr. Pitt. \nWhereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy -- \nARMSTRONG Police catch you trying to steal my hat, you asshole?! \nHe staggers toward Gordy.    Grabs the hat. \nARMSTRONG Fucking hat thief! \nArmstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but... \nThe Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same. \nFelix respectfully interjects.     It's almost a plea. \nFELIX (in Spanish) We need to fix the equipment. We have delivery deadlines to meet. \n(CONTINUED) \n177   CONTINUED:                                                    177 \nA long beat. The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass back to Gordy. In a hard tone to Felix -- \nELC SUPERVISOR (in Spanish) He's your responsibility. Don't let him out of your sight. \nFELIX Si.   Gracias. \nAs Felix leads Gordy away... \n178   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY                         178 \nGordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q. Felix resumes his former tone of command. \nFELIX The Supervisor made you my responsibility... You don't go anywhere without me, you understand? \nGORDY No problemo. \nGordy peers out the window intently as they drive, looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf, searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third- world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy, seeing another side of the guerrillas... \n179   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                     179 \nFelix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 \"Rat Patrol\" assault truck and four heavily armed ELC guerrillas. \nGORDY The E.L.C. guards your coffee beans? \nFelix thinks he's joking. Until he looks over and sees Gordy's actually being sincere. \n(CONTINUED) \n179   CONTINUED:                                                  179 \nFELIX ... Coffee beans? Shit. Armstrong didn't tell you much... \n180   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER - PLANTATION - DAY                   180 \nThey approach a hacienda and outbuildings. The accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors, sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm. There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC guerrillas stand guard. \n181   FELIX                                                       181 \nstops the car. He and Gordy get out. Felix begins leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds. \nFELIX The problem's with the diesel generators. The sons-of-bitches keep breaking down. \n182   NEW ANGLE                                                   182 \nThey pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep in a thick, foul-smelling liquid. \nFELIX We're using portables to keep production going, but they don't supply enough power to the heat lamps, and we have to dry a lot of... 'coffee beans.' \n183   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               183 \nThey're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where portable gas GENERATORS THRUM, and... \nGordy can see long, wide platforms inside. Above the platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps. Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two of converted cocaine. \n184   IN ANOTHER SHED                                             184 \nworkers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for shipment. \n185   GORDY AND FELIX                                                185 \napproach the two giant diesel generators. \nFELIX We can fix anything, but these keep dying on us... You'll start now. I'll have tools brought to you. (beat) Armstrong's a magician with them. Let's hope you have his skill. \nFelix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks to him. Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him. \n186   SAME SCENE - LATER                                             186 \nGordy has the diesels partially dismantled. The guerrilla sentry is still right there. Felix returns. \nFELIX Well? \nGordy has to think of something fast.    Beat.   He throws a machine part against a wall angrily. \nGORDY I can't work with these pieces of junk. \nFELIX Junk? These generators cost a fortune. \nGORDY Then treat them that way. \nFELIX (beat, then) Armstrong always fixes them. \nGORDY Armstrong wants your money. He makes them work, but he doesn't fix them... To do this right, we gotta order parts from Europe. In the meantime, I can make something temporary. There must be a machine shop in town. \nFELIX ... Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n186   CONTINUED:                                                          186 \nGordy stands. \nGORDY Let's go. \nOFF Felix, forced to acquiesce... \n187   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               187 \nFelix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it. But it's all he can do. \nGordy STARTS the CAR and drives after the Suburban. \n195   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                          195 \nGordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles -- \nFELIX ... I'll take her to a small restaurant... We'll have lobster and drink lots of wine... I'll get her drunk... We'll drive home... I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss her... And then, I'll screw her in my bed... \nThe Suburban pulls up next to a house.       There are armed guerrilla guards outside. \nFELIX ... And when I am done screwing her, she'll never want to look at another man again... \nGordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start carrying the beer inside. And a moment later... \nFelix comes around with a start. \nFELIX What the fuck are you doing?! \nHe unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy. \nGORDY Hey, easy... What's the problem? \n(CONTINUED) \n195   CONTINUED:                                                      195 \nFELIX You're going the wrong goddamn way! \nGORDY I am?... Looks different in the dark... \nFELIX Turn around! \nGordy turns the car around.     Felix keeps the gun on him. \nFELIX You drive where I say... Or the Supervisor will have us both shot. \nGordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and... \nGordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the other way: a large propane tank next to the house. \n196   EXT. PLANTATION - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                         196 \nThe work in the sheds continues.

He has two sentries now. One wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to the grenades hanging on the vest's front. \n199   EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - DAY                       199 \nThe sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's still working under the watchful eyes of the guards. \nNearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when... \n(CONTINUED) \n199   CONTINUED:                                                    199 \nA man is injured, and his teammates call for one of Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest and shirt, and runs in. \nGordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades. With the other guard still watching him closely, however, there's nothing Gordy can do. \n200   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            200 \nThe soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal. \nGordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon... \nGordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and... \nGordy grabs a grenade.    Almost gets it into a tool box, when... \nThe player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and... \nGordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the grenade's still visible as now... \nFelix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover. And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress. \nFELIX It's afternoon. Yesterday, you said it would only take two more hours. \nGordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade. \nGORDY I have this one ready to go. \nGordy reaches up and hits the start button on the GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and... \nThis time,   the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The heat lamps   brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as the DIESEL   ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head pound even   harder. \nFELIX What about the other one? \n(CONTINUED) \n200   CONTINUED:                                                            200 \nGORDY I just need another part from town, and it's five more minutes. \nFELIX ... Shit.     Fine. Let's go. \nGordy grabs the tool box. \nFELIX Why're you bringing the tool box? \nGORDY The old part's in there. I need to match it, and it's all greasy. \nFelix buys it and heads off.          As Gordy follows him... \nHe's found The Wolf, when... \nSuddenly, a guard appears, and... \nGordy freezes. Eases into the shadows. His dirty face and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past. \n244   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                244 \nWhen the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand, holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then... \nSlowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring- loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now, Gordy's going up in the blast. \nGordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it. \nGordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers. And...

He looks in the direction of the sound, and... \nGordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish. \nGordy's eyes flash with alarm.   He glances at the house. \n247   CLOSEUP - GRENADE                                              247 \nThe lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands, which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and stretch from the pressure of the spoon. \n248   BACK TO SCENE                                                  248 \nGordy looks back at the Woman and boy, closer now, walking toward the house. \n249   FLASHBACK - NEW YORK                                           249 \nAnne and Matt wave to him across Madison Avenue. \n250   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        250 \nGordy sees the Woman pull the boy close to her, lovingly. \n251   FLASHBACK - NEW YORK                                           251 \nThe BOMB EXPLODES, and Anne moves to protect Matt. \n252   CLOSE ON GORDY (PRESENT)                                       252 \nHe realizes the horror of what will happen.

She's holding the photo of Anne and Matt. Beat. Gordy takes the photo. Looks at his wife and son. Selena sits next to him. Another beat. Then, off the photo... \nSELENA Claudio used to be a teacher. I was a medical aid worker. We met in Guatemala, in an Indian village called Guamaunco. We were married there. Sophia, our daughter was born there. Claudio was kind and loving, and we were happy... We were there four years when the civil war broke out... The guerrillas were all around us, but left us alone... Then they made an attack on the army nearby. The next night, soldiers came to our village. They were led by American 'advisors'... They accused us of helping the rebels. Our women were raped. Our men were tortured. Our homes were burned... We crawled out into the fields, but they threw grenades, and Sophia... \nSelena hesitates, choking back her emotions. \nSELENA ... my baby girl was hit by shrapnel... she bled to death in Claudio's arms. \nShe looks into Gordy's eyes.

OFF them, as the copper recedes upriver... \n318   EXT. RIVER - DAWN                                                      318 \nGordy and Selena float side-by-side, still holding onto the cans. Mauro's asleep on Gordy's back, his arms around Gordy's neck. Weakened by her wound, Selena keeps bobbing below the surface. Gordy pulls her up. \nGORDY Hang on. We just have to keep floating a little bit more... \nSuddenly, in the growing light, Gordy sees Selena's blood in the water and realizes she's wounded. \nGORDY You were shot. \nSELENA ... I'm okay. \nGORDY We gotta get you outta the river. \n319   GORDY                                                                  319 \nkicks them all to shore. \nSELENA I don't recognize anything...

He said he   wanted the people of America   to feel the terror. 'Terror   is all they understand.' He said   it over and over... \nPHIPPS (to Dray) Double up on public venues: museums, theaters, transport... Put in all the extra undercover we can. \nSelena looks over at her son sleeping in Gordy's arms. She lovingly brushes the hair off his forehead, rattling her seashells. The leather doll is about to fall from Mauro's fingers. Selena takes the doll and puts it into her bag. Then looks out at the passing scenery.

Phipps stops him. \nPHIPPS My people will debrief you in another room... We'll take the boy to a safe house across the street... He'll be well cared for. \nGordy exchanges a look with Selena. Beat.

There's a rental van and a big Ducati motorbike against a wall. Claudio straps a black bag onto the bike, then rolls it out and shuts the garage. Pulls on helmet and STARTS the BIKE.

Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the fire escape steps. \nThe fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in. \n396    INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               396 \nSelena's in a teenager's bedroom. The teenager's got headphones on, oblivious to everything.

Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs to the next town house roof. \nGordy hits the roof behind her. \n403   SELENA                                                         403 \nAs Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of town houses, we see her warrior determination and discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally well-trained and determined firefighter. And he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her. Selena strains harder. \n404   SELENA                                                         404 \nvaults a gap.

A fire escape ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar, Selena takes the ladder down. \n405A   MOMENTS LATER                                                 405A \nGordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands, squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over. \n406    EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD                                      406 \nThe fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where, across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate opens onto the street. \nGordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm. Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading to the ground. \n407    GORDY'S                                                       407 \ngot one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either. Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a living. \nGordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps. Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk. Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now... \n408    ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 408 \nHe's between Selena and the only way out.   And there's no way she's getting past him. \nBut that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can. It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over, the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard. \nSelena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit. It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg. It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head. \n(CONTINUED) \n408   CONTINUED:                                                       408 \nGordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate. Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can across the slate pavers, and... \nThe can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run, when... \nGordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have to kill him before he'd let go. \nGordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses in her ear -- \nGORDY You killed them. \nSELENA (beat; with contempt) One woman, one boy -- they mean nothing next to the thousands who've been slain. \nGordy hears it.    It only drives him to a deeper fury. \nGORDY They were my family. \n", "test1_input": "50   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               50 \nSAL Christ.

He was careful to duck the camera. \nPHIPPS Run a total analysis. I want to know if this asshole's right or left-handed. I want everything you can get outta this film. \nPhipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the blast site. Streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on the garage floor. Pieces of the Navigators rest in front of the area marked \"consulate;\" parts of an NYPD traffic scooter rest in front of the Navigators; \"X's\" mark where Anne and Matt were standing. \nPhipps crosses to another AGENT. \nPHIPPS Any helpful information coming outta Colombia? \nAGENT Not yet.

In an e-mail to the New York Times, a Marxist extremist known only as 'The Wolf,' states that the bombing was, quote, 'not an act of terror but an act of war, aimed at stopping your C.I.A. murderers and their fascist puppets from committing further acts of repression against the people of Colombia,' unquote... Two Colombian officials and an American military officer died in last Thursday's blast. Also killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a New York City firefighter, and their only child, four-year-old Matt... The President has vowed that the United States will avenge what he called 'this monstrous act of barbarism and cowardice'... Intelligence sources say the identity and whereabouts of The Wolf remain a mystery. They believe he has worked closely with radical elements in Latin America for more than twenty years and have linked him to numerous terrorist bombings, including the 1983 downing of a Peruvian airliner, which killed forty-two people, eleven of them Americans...

As the Beaten Man continues to question Felix... \nGordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe. \n(CONTINUED) \n218   CONTINUED:                                                         218 \nQuickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose. \nGordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is being covered by the DIESELS. \nGordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole. Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement. \n219   EXT.

The heat lights dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to see what's happening. At which point, the generator now BURSTS into FLAMES. \n222   BACK TO GORDY                                                      222 \nHe smiles. \nGORDY Just in time... \nAnd we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as... \nThe water jet breaks through.      The hole's still small. Gordy begins to widen it. \n223   EXT. PLANTATION                                               223 \nFelix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume their march toward the storeroom. \n", "test3_true": "224   INT. STOREROOM                                                224 \nGordy's gone. The Beaten Man signals two men to go out the hole. To the other man -- \nBEATEN MAN (in Spanish) Organize the others. Find him. \nThe man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone -- \nFELIX (in Spanish) He can't be far. You'll catch -- \nBANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water still streaming across the floor... \n225   EXT. PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER                               225 \nThe guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation -- \nBEATEN MAN (in Spanish) Keep looking. \nHe signals his men to come with him.   They get into the Suburban. Whereupon we FIND... \n226   UNDER SUBURBAN                                                226 \nGordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other, to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START, grabs the transfer case, and... \n227   SUBURBAN                                                     227 \nROARS off with Gordy suspended below. \nThe rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy- duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going to be a long, dangerous ride. \n228   EXT. SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                               228 \nAs the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the darkened town... \n229   GORDY                                                        229 \ncontinues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands. \nA vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The grenade falls, and... \nGordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to lose it. And just as it falls... \nGordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags the grenade before it drops to the road. And then... \nCarefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach, where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back. Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm. \n230   ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD                                          230 \nthe Suburban passes the \"Cine.\"   The movie's over, just letting out. \n231   EXT. GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT                                 231 \nThe Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again right away. \n232   GORDY                                                          232 \ncarefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on the side away from the house. Hides behind a large wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps. \n233   TREES                                                          233 \nGordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't looking, when he reaches one tree, and... \n234   NEW ANGLE                                                      234 \nTHUNK!   A coconut hits the ground next to him, and... \nOne of the guards comes to investigate. \nThe guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to roll away, and... \nThe guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back. \n235   GORDY                                                          235 \nsneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there. But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the wall. Looks into another room, and... \n236   INSIDE                                                         236 \nis a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man, packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry. \n237   GORDY                                                          237 \nscans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's nothing familiar about him, either. When... \n238   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  238 \nDirectly in front of us, another man emerges from a room. He's also in ELC guerrilla camo. (CONTINUED) \n238   CONTINUED:                                                   238 \nOFF Gordy, looking intently at the man. \n239   FLASHBACK - SURVEILLANCE TAPE                                239 \nThe face of the cop outside the consulate. \n240   MAN (PRESENT)                                                240 \nin the room.    His face looms larger as he ADVANCES TOWARDS us. \n241   FLASHBACK - COP'S FACE                                       241 \nwhen he bumped into Gordy on E. 64th Street. \n242   CLOSE ON MAN (PRESENT)                                       242 \nin the room.    It's the same face. \n243   BACK TO GORDY                                                243 \n"}

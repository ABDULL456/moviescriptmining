JAEGER So where do we start? 
Epps takes a look around, then shrugs. 
EPPS Wherever you want. 
Epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack.  Jaeger follows suit.  He looks around, picks a spot and starts digging. 
FADE TO: 
WES - LATER 
He sits up top, weapon in hand, standing guard. 
FADE TO: 
EPPS AND JAEGER - LATER 
They dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave.  They dig with a determination to find something. 
FADE TO: 
WES - LATER 
Still up top, he's given up on standing guard.  Now he stretches out on the ground sunning himself. 
FADE TO: 
EPPS AND JAEGER 
Their shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt. They look like they've been digging for quite some time. 
They certainly don't have the same enthusiasm they displayed previously.  Now they just seem to dig by rote. 
FADE TO: 
WES - LATER 
The sun has begun to sink noticeably.  Wes leans over the crevice. 
WES Hey...Hey!  Sun's going down.  Epps! Jaeger!  It's getting dark up here. 
CUT TO: 
EPPS AND JAEGER - SIMULTANEOUS 
It's obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come up with nothing.  Epps keeps digging, but just barely. Jaeger doesn't even bother anymore.  He just sits on the ground sulking. 
WES(O.C.) Epps! 
EPPS I heard! 
CUT TO: 
WES 
He rolls over and scoffs. 
WES There's nothing down there. 
CUT TO: 
EPPS AND JAEGER 
Epps notices Jaeger just sitting there. 
EPPS What are you doing? 
JAEGER What does it look like I'm doing? 
EPPS It looks like you're not doing anything. 
JAEGER I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here. 
EPPS Get up and dig. 
JAEGER We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it. 
EPPS Get up off your ass and dig! 
Sounding defeated as all hell, and very whiney: 
JAEGER What's the point?  There's nothing here. The map's a fake.  Christ, even I see that now.  We're just wasting our time. We might as well give up and-- 
Epps spins.  Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger, grabbing him up and pulling him close.

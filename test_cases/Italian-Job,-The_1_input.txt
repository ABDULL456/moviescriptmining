A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives it the legendary Mini look. 
If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile soul. 
INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY 
Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling. 
She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs. 
Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in. 
Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with ease. She's right in front of -- 
HER SHOP 
Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a poised walk she heads inside. 
INT. SHOP - DAY 
It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her. 
RECEPTIONIST How long? 
STELLA Four minutes, forty-three seconds. 
High-five. 
RECEPTIONIST You're the man. 
STELLA So what's on the line-up? 
RECEPTIONIST 2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. Owner died and the wife never knew the combination. And Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning. Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler. 
STELLA Tell him if I don't have it opened in six minutes flat, breakfast is on me. 
RECEPTIONIST And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. He said you two know each other. (an aside) And he looks pretty fine for a white boy. 
Without a response, Stella heads over to -- 
HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR 
and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that line the shelves. 
STELLA Charlie Croker. 
He turns around. Smiles. Charming. 
CHARLIE Hi, Stella. 
She steps inside. 
STELLA Refresh my memory. After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father, I told you I never wanted to see you again, didn't I? 
CHARLIE Yeah. You did. 
STELLA So I'm a little confused. 
CHARLIE I found him. 
At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling. 
CHARLIE I can tell you where he is. 
STELLA I don't want to know. 
CHARLIE Are you sure? 
She doesn't answer. 
CHARLIE He's in Los Angeles. 
She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask him not to. So he goes on... 
CHARLIE The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl. I've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak. 
Stella remembers him. 
STELLA When I was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find. 
CHARLIE He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time. 
STELLA You ever heard the expression, cut to the chase?

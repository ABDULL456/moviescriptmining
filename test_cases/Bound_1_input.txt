He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds.  Corky stares at it. 
CAESAR Come on, come on.  if you understand what I'm talking about you're going to take the money.  if you don't, I'm going to have to worry about you. 
Corky takes it.  Caesar smiles. 
CAESAR Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers. 
CORKY I should be going. 
CAESAR What?  How about a drink? 
CORKY My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though. 
CAESAR Another time. 
CORKY Sure. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water. 
When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the edge. 
She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, noticing her left hand. 
It is the hand that was between Violet's legs. 
She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror. 
CORKY What are you doing? 
She drops her hand. 
CORKY What am I doing?  I'm fucking up, that's what I'm doing. 
She scrubs her hands clean. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
It is late, the area burnished with amber street light. Corky walks from the building to her truck. 
She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when suddenly the passenger door opens and -- 
Violet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her. 
VIOLET I had to see you. 
CORKY Look, I don't think this is a good idea. 
VIOLET I wanted to apologize. 
CORKY Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex. 
Violet smiles. 
VIOLET I'm not apologizing for what I did -- 
She slides across the seat. 
VIOLET I'm apologizing for what I didn't do. 
She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't tell. 
The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, breaks the kiss. 
VIOLET Do you have a bed somewhere? 
Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine. 
INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The sex. 
There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it. 
It is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian sex -- 
Pungent and potent -- 
And when it is over, neither woman can move. 
Finally, Corky's eyes flutter open. 
CORKY I can see again. 
Violet smiles. 
Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead. 
After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh." 
Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to the bed. 
She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, watching Violet's throat as she drinks.

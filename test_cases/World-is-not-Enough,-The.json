HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nAn engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the \"private banking institute\" within. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY \nJAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by three THUGS in Armani suits.  They remove A GUN from inside his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them on the desk that separates Bond and... \nLACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him, three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden. \nLACHAISE Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position.. \nBOND Which is neutral, no doubt. \nLachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped.  Gestures for Bond to sit. \nA GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped suit.  She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond. \nLACHAISE It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the money.  No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again. \nThe efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond, setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good deal of CASH in pound sterling. \nLACHAISE In the current exchange rate, minus the fees, of course, and certain unforeseeable expenses. Here is the receipt... \nThe CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT... \nCIGAR GIRL Would you like to check my figures? \nBOND Perhaps later. \nShe steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the desk...the THUGS TENSE... \nBOND My glasses. \nLachaise nods.  Bond can have his glasses. \nHe puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny: \nLACHAISE It's all there. \nBond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise. \nBOND I didn't come for the money. The report you sold him was stolen from an MI-6 agent, who was killed for it. \nHe takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk. \nLACHAISE I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. \nBOND Who did you get it from? \nLACHAISE I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner... \nBOND And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss. \nLACHAISE (controlled fury) Your last chance. Take the money. \nBOND Your last chance. Give me the name. \nLACHAISE Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me? \nHe nods.  An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun... \nBOND Perhaps you failed to take into account my...hidden assets. \nBond's mouth edges into a smile.  A flicker of doubt on Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the tiny arm of his glasses and... \nKABOOM!  The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his opening... \nHe KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun. Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW just as they're getting their bearings.  Now he nestles the barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's cheek. \nBOND The name? \nLACHAISE I can't tell you... (Bond cocks the gun) Alright, alright! But you must protect me! \nAnd he freezes.  The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking out of his neck.  Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF. \nBond rushes to the window... \nEXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY \nShe swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly disappearing into shadows. \nBond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to... \nTHE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door, casually slipping that cigar into his pocket... \nExcept Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in hand.  He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart. \nBond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out. \nINT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY \nBond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below. \nMoneypenny's eyes shoot to the intercom console: \nM (filtered) Moneypenny, stop King leaving. \nMONEYPENNY (flicking switch) Security -- \nINT. CORRIDORS, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nSir Robert King and an MI-6 AIDE walk toward SECURITY. \nINT. Q DIVISION, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nQ and his men are working on a strange half-built BOAT suspended over a water tank. \nQ ..the hydro boat can operate in three inches of water... \nHe looks up as Bond runs through... \nINT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nTHE MONEY lies on the tray, wrapped in plastic. \nSir Robert approaches, two rows of security bars between him and the cash.  An official produces a bag and moves toward it: \nSIR ROBERT Thanks, but I'll count it myself. (apologetic, smiles) Lifetime habit.  I'm Scottish. \nINT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nBond shoots around the corner just in time to see Sir Robert disappearing past the THICK STEEL DOOR of the secure room. \nBOND Stop!  King! \nINT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nThe shout is muffled, Sir Robert's more interested in the money. \nHe continues toward camera, that PIN on his lapel emits a serene HUM and we \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON THE METAL STRIP IN ONE NOTE AS IT CRACKLES AND -- KABOOM!  A MASSIVE EXPLOSION. \nINT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nMAYHEM.  FIRE blasts out of the open doorway just as Bond reaches it.  The STEEL DOOR flies toward him.  He dives -- \nEXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS \nThe building rocks.  SMOKE is pouring from a HOLE that's appeared in a lower tier. A wall and a section of roof gone. \nEXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS \nA figure staggers out, shaken.  Catching his breath.  BOND. \nCUT TO: \nECU CIGAR GIRL \nLining up Bond with her infra-red telescopic sight. \nANGLE ON BOND \nIn the swirling dust and smoke, he suddenly sees a wand of red light, pointing at his chest. \nAll instinct, he dives for cover.  Powerful, high velocity bullet hits blanket the area.  Bond prepares to return fire, scanning around for the source. Through the debris he spots an unusual, hi-tech BOAT on the river -- long and narrow and low.  A figure on board.  THE CIGAR GIRL. \nANGLE ON CIGAR GIRL \nShe FIRES OFF A ROUND OF SHOTS, forcing Bond back into cover. Then she guns the engines and SPEEDS OFF down the Thames. \nEXT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nDetermined, Bond races back into the wreckage... \nINT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS \nBond races through the chaos that is MI-6 and into... \nQ DIVISION \nWhere he leaps into the prototype BOAT.  Q protests... \nQ It's not finished! \nBond looks at the mystifying number of buttons and gadgets ...presses something red and...THE BOAT LEAPS OUT, ENGINE ROARING... \nEXT. SLIPWAY - RIVER - DAY \nTHE 007 THEME KICKS IN AS: \nJAMES BOND, in the Q boat, SHOOTS OUT of the MI-6 rubble and onto the Thames. \nEXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY \nBond can see the Cigar Girl up ahead...he is closing the distance.  She catches sight of him in pursuit... \nEXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY \nShe pushes the boat to its limit, it roars to a new level of speed...the chase is on. \nEXT. THAMES - DAY \nBOND FALLS, heading straight toward... \nTHE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over. \nAS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas tank... \nEXT. BALLOON - DAY \nThe BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar Girl with it... \nEXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY \nBond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of the Millennium Dome breaking his fall. \nEXT. MILLENNIUM DOME ROOF - DAY \nHe slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON... \nTHE GROUND BELOW \nHe struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky as we zero in on the iris of... \nHIS EYE \nreflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the screen transforms into... \nTHE MAIN TITLES \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTRY ESTATE, LOCH LOMOND - DAY \nBAGPIPES.  A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters of Loch Lomond. \nA long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial service.  They mill about on the lawn, among them,  M, grim- faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in a black sling. \nBond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd... \nHIS P.O.V.  It's like a state funeral.  Rich and powerful people, government ministers, chief executives from around the world...and then... \nFAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing sunglasses and a military haircut. \nThe man seems to see Bond looking at him... \nM Bond, we'll meet you inside. \nBond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back, the man is gone, like an APPARITION. \nBond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise. \nCUT TO: \nTHE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY \nBond stands on the hill, looking below.  He sees nothing but a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind. \nHe hears a crunch of leaves...turns... \nHIS P.O.V.  A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill. Her china doll face is both fragile and proud. \nWOMAN Beautiful, isn't it? \nBOND Yes. \nShe steps up to the ridge with him.  A breeze blows her hair. They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and strafe the valley. \nWOMAN Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine. \nBOND Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs. \nWOMAN A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a hostile takeover. \nBOND You knew him well? \nThe sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe. \nWOMAN He was my father. \nBOND I'm sorry. \nWOMAN He died before he could complete his lifelong dream. (beat) I intend to finish it for him. \nA voice interrupts them, calling from the estate... \nOLDER MAN Elektra! \nELEKTRA Excuse me. \nShe walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her delicate figure.  She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks back toward her father's grand house. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY \nM, Bond and Tanner in the rear of a limousine. The vehicle swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish Highlands. \nM Elektra?  Running King Industries? (she broods) I've known that girl all her life. I'm not sure she knows what she's walking into. \nBOND She's not a girl anymore. \nM looks at Bond. Eyes his sling. \nTanner notices a RED LIGHT start pulsing.  He moves to M: \nTANNER Your call to the PM. \nM nods grimly.  As Robinson distributes sealed envelopes: \nM Our credibility has been hit hard.  We have to hit back harder. Your assignments. \nThey open their envelopes, but Bond received nothing. \nM (to Bond) I'm waiting for the report on your medical. \nShe leaves.  Bond is brooding. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESEARCH ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - NIGHT \nAn ancient nook chock full of hi-tech equipment.  Bond concentrates on a screen displaying PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER AND TELEVISION CLIPS -- all to do with King's life and times. \nBond touches the screen on a photo of...ELEKTRA. \nINT. SCREEN \nOne story dominates -- the KIDNAPPING OF ELEKTRA KING. A Polaroid of Elektra savagely beaten, ear bandaged, holding a newspaper: beneath the photo is scrawled \"$5,000,000.\" \nNEWSCASTER ...somehow managed to shoot two of her captors and escape... \nPOLICE VIDEO: Elektra interviewed; bruised, emotional. \nVOICE ... the leader, the one who escaped.  Can you describe him? \nELEKTRA He shouted.  He shouted all the time -- \nBond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears. \nHis eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand: $5,000,000.  A thought forms.  He takes out his wallet, opening it and removing: \nTHE RECEIPT FROM LACHAISE. \nE.C.U. The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303.03. \nBond taps some keys. The words EXCHANGE RATE appear on the screen...pounds to dollars. \nHe enters '3,030,303.03 POUNDS STERLING' and through multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes: \n'5,000,000 US DOLLARS.'  He stares at it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - DUSK \nBond paces the flagstones, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - CONTINUOUS \nBond opens the door on M who stands alone by the window, looking out at the long shadows on the moors. \nBOND Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King. \nShe turns, her brow furrowing. \nM Who told you to look at Elektra's files? \nBOND I took the initiative. \nM You haven't been given an assignment in this case. \nBOND I was the one who brought that money in... \nM I'm well aware of your stake in this, If you have a point, get to it. \nBOND The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra. \nHe hands her a slip of paper. \nBOND Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man who killed her father. \nM looks at the paper, a long time. \nM It's a message.  He wants us to know he's back. \nBOND Who? \nM Claude Serrault.  A.K.A... \nBOND (this is serious) Renard. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- NIGHT \nA HUGE, TRANSPARENT 3-D IMAGE OF RENARD'S SKULL floats in the centre of the room.  Other images of him on wall screens. \nM Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra's ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. (measured) I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him. \nBOND Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist? \nM How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I'd do the same again. \nShe turns to the hologram. \nThe jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets Bond saw being laid as he passed... \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY \nDavidov pulls out Bond's gun. \nBOND (re:  gun) I'd rather you didn't play with that. \nDavidov ignores him, looking the gun over. \nDAVIDOV Nice. \nBOND Quite stunning. \nBond turns to watch a LIFTING HELICOPTER swoop in and drop down an air-conditioned office.  Military precision. \nDavidov's radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun back to Bond.  They start walking: \nDAVIDOV (pleasant) Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits die hard. I am Head of Security. Davidov. \nBond eyes him, but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt ahead of them. \nStairs swing down and out steps ELEKTRA KING.  Beautiful, elegant.  So out of place in this world of men.  She surveys the worksite. \nImpressed, Bond takes his ID back from Davidov. \nINT. OFFICE, CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS \nBond and Davidov step into a fully functioning office. Everything Elektra requires is here. Computer, phones, drinks cabinet. She is in the middle of a group of workmen and secretaries, looking at plans, talking, pouring herself a cup of coffee. \nELEKTRA (to Foreman) ...they should have been in place two days ago. That is the target my father set. \nFOREMAN We've had some trouble with the villagers at Ruan. Some sacred burial plot... \nDAVIDOV Miss King...James Bond here to see you. \nShe looks up...a brief moment of RECOGNITION...then back to business. \nELEKTRA Find me the research on the limestone deposits, go ahead and place these orders, and get the jeep ready. I will go to Ruan myself... \nDAVIDOV Miss King, I wouldn't recommend... \nELEKTRA I said, I will go. \nShe signs some documents and the men file out. She gets up, turning her back to Bond, hands on her hips. \nELEKTRA Would you excuse us, Davidov? \nDavidov nods and leaves. Elektra still keeps her back turned, but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her arms cross in front of her. When she finds her voice, it has a gravelly sound of emotion. \nELEKTRA I met you at my father's funeral. \nBOND Yes. \nELEKTRA I haven't been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now. \nBOND Funerals aren't exactly memorable. \nELEKTRA God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don't want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father. (beat) I loved him.  I'm not sure he knew that. \nBOND Is that why you want to finish the pipeline? \nELEKTRA Partially, yes. \nHer muscleman BODY GUARD appears, says briefly: \nGABOR The jeep is ready, Ma'am.  Will I be driving with you? \nELEKTRA No, Gabor. We have a guest. \nGabor glares at Bond before he leaves. \nBOND Who is he? \nELEKTRA My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He's decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette. \nBOND How long has he been with you? \nELEKTRA Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask? \nBond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm, shows it to her. \nBOND Does this look familiar to you? \nELEKTRA It's my father's pin. He wore it everyday of his life. \nShe swallows back emotion. Looks in his eyes, with a sad half- smile that unsettles him. \nELEKTRA Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women? \nBOND It's not the pin your father wore. It's an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company. \nELEKTRA If you've come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don't need a third... \nShe starts to walk out.  He follows her... \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS \nBOND The killer doesn't want to see this pipeline continue, doesn't want to see you take over... \nELEKTRA That's every man within a five mile radius.  Including you. (off his look) That's why you're here, isn't it? You think I can't do it. You think I'm going to screw up. Or get myself killed. \nBond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the only two people in the world, when they hear: THE DISTANT HUM OF A PLANE. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nThey see FOUR OBJECTS falling out the back of the aircraft. As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they POP PARACHUTES, their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra watch in disbelief... \nGUNFIRE echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as PARASKIS, low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY \nBond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the approaching machines. \nBOND Head for that gully, I'll lure them into the trees! \nHe points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers cover...she skis off to shelter and he skis OUT...INTO THE OPEN...where the paraskis trail after him... \nHe streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him, firing... \nEXT. FOREST \nHe makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees, whipping in and out of sight as PARASKI #1 tries to follow, sinking lower and lower until... \nHIS SKIDS catch on some over hanging branches...the Paraski is CATAPULTED into a tree and EXPLODES... \nEXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS \nComing in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2, firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind him in the snow.  The other two paraskis LAND and eject their chutes, now RACING THROUGH THE WOODS on the ground. \nBond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit another and wipe out behind. \nBut the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is gaining on him...Bond bursts out of the trees and finds himself heading toward... \nTHE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE... \nHe cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the edge.  Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and SAILS OFF THE CLIFF to a hundred and fifty foot drop. \nBOND (smiling) Should have stuck to snowboarding. \nBut the smile is wiped off his face as...AN EMERGENCY PARACHUTE deploys from the back... \nThe Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for him... \nBond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when PARASKI #2 appears in front of him...guns blazing... \nOne ahead and one behind, Bond turns back...he has nowhere to go but... \nOVER THE EDGE \nHe sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4, slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow, where he lands on his skis... Paraski four, the chute tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond, they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER... \nIN THE GULLY BELOW \nBond meets up with Elektra as above them... \nThe two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above and tumbling down, end over end. \nBond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain down on them. \nThen...silence.  An eerie silence. \nELEKTRA Are they gone? All of them? \nBond nods, ripping from his pole a PIECE OF THE PARACHUTE he slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece of fabric in his hand.  He sees: \nCYRILLIC LETTERS...undecipherable to us...but there is a look on his face, a look of recognition as... \nAN EARTH RATTLING RUMBLE grows above them. \nBond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he turns... \nThe exploding Paraskis have triggered AN AVALANCHE on the slope above. \nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY \nThey try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they haven't a hope... the rest of the snow is catching them, they're going to get swallowed. \nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY \nThe ground shudders, the THUNDER CLOSING...  Their ankles are soon covered, Elektra falls.  Bond stops, pulls her up. They're about to die.  He pulls her to him. \nBOND Hold on to me. \nShe's confused and frightened but does as she's told. \nThey hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white fury hurtles over them, burying them...  At the last moment, just as their heads vanish from view... \nCLOSE ON BOND PULLING THE Q GADGET ON THE JACKET. \nThe AIRBAG slams open.  The snow covers it and them.  More and more snow slides over... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SNOW HOLE - MOMENTS LATER \nDarkness.  The RUMBLING CEASES... \nLight emanates from Bond's watch.  In the shadows he pulls a knife, punctures the air bag. It deflates, leaving them cocooned in an icy tomb.  Elektra looks around, staring, unbelieving. \nELEKTRA Oh my God...we're buried alive... \nBOND We're alright. \nDAVIDOV (croaks out) Bond... \nRENARD Should be dead as well. Your failure today is astonishing.  It is a disgrace. \nHe approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming SCONCE near his head. \nRENARD Do you know why the color is blue at the wick? \nDavidov starts to sweat. \nRENARD Because that is where the flame is the hottest. \nRenard touches the glass well of oil. \nRENARD The temperature is close to five hundred degrees. \nRenard uses his knife and POPS the seal from the lamp, removing the well of oil...a DROP of the hot oil FALLS ON HIS HAND and SINGES IT BLACK in an instant... \nRenard does not even flinch.  Davidov starts talking, trying to placate... \nDAVIDOV The plane...it's all been arranged... \nRENARD Then you are completely unnecessary... \nRenard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head: \nDAVIDOV I have the documents, the landing authorizations, the security passes... \nRenard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour... \nHis dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw him?...seems to glitter in the light... \nRENARD Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner, tonight.  We understand each other? \nDAVIDOV Yes...yes... \nRenard lets a TRICKLE OF OIL drop onto Davidov's head... \nHE SCREAMS as his hair smokes and singes... \nRenard makes a motion, the THUG releases Davidov, who falls to the floor, clutching his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE \nAnother deal. ZUKOVSKY and others watch, as Elektra stakes even more.  People move closer for a view.  The Dealer shows a five. Elektra shows Bond her cards. \nElektra is holding two eights. Dealer's up-card is a six. \nBOND Stand or split them. \nShe smiles. He holds her gaze. \nELEKTRA Surely you believe in living dangerously. \nBOND Not at that price. Time to surrender. \nThey eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air. She smiles.  She moves ALL HER CHIPS forward. \nBond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky: \nDEALER The House has no limit. \nGeneral kerfuffle.  Bond looks back toward THE HOSTESS BAR...no sign of Davidov's return... \nELEKTRA (to Dealer) Hit me. \nThe Dealer scoops a card from the shoe.  Tension.  Everyone holds their breath...as he turns over...  -- a six.  Bust. The audience inhale as one AS THE DEALER TAKES ALL HER CHIPS AWAY. \nElektra stands.  She has dignity in defeat. She turns to Bond, holding out a hand. \nELEKTRA Time to surrender. \nEXT. CASINO - NIGHT \nBond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them, trying to look like he hasn't been through hell.  Bond notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self- consciously. \nDAVIDOV A little accident. \nBOND A night of burning passion? \nDavidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away... \nCUT TO: \nA DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE. \nSomeone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW. \nHENCHMAN (V.O.) What about Bond? \nEXT. CASINO ROOF \nRENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back, their easy sensuality as they both get into the car. \nHENCHMAN Sir?  Sir? \nRENARD (seething) I will take care of Mister Bond. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TEST CHAMBER MAIN ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER \nBond descends, going down deep. \nINT. TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER \nThe elevator creaks to a halt.  He slides the elevator doors OPEN revealing... \nTWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator. Bond shows them his ID. \nSOLDIER (subtitles) See the corporal, at the end of the chamber. \nThe soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving Bond completely ALONE. \nDead silence in the shadows.  Bond's in his element, that alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings. \nHIS P.O.V.  A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming there. \nBond starts down the passageway. \nINT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS \nAhead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit. \nBlast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring equipment. \nBond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in Russian Army fatigues. \nBOND Corporal? \nThe man turns... \nIT IS RENARD. \nHe smiles. \nRENARD I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty. \nBOND Indeed. \nRenard starts toward him.  Bond draws his gun. \nBOND Don't come any closer. \nMAN You can't kill me. I'm already dead. \nHe and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit. \nRENARD Go ahead.  Shoot.  My men will still steal the bomb, and the shot will bring them directly to you. \nRenard gestures into the pit. \nBOND'S P.O.V.  TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner. \nBond aims his gun at Renard's head. \nBOND Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline? \nRenard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless. \nRENARD To die by a man who can't even grasp what he's caught up in... \nBond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb.  It is the size and shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on it...the man slips it into his pocket. \nBOND Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's clever is getting someone else to pay for it. \nRENARD Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune. \nBond cocks the pistol. \nBOND Who is it? \nRENARD You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no? (closer now) She's beautiful isn't she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed... \nBond's eyes flare in fury.  He shoves Renard into the wall and presses the gun to his temple. \nBOND You will never touch her. You will never get near her. \nRENARD Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva? \nBOND Consider me ungrateful. \nRENARD It's I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair. \nBOND She'll get over it. \nRENARD You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn't have done it without you. \nBond strikes him across the temple with his pistol.  Renard drops to his knees.  He touches his temple, looks at the blood curiously, feeling no pain. \nRENARD A man tires of being executed. \nAs Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun: \nRENARD But then again...There is no point in living if you can't...feel alive. \nBond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES HIM, just a beat, but it is enough... \nSUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers. \nWe're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard -- classic execution stance: \nRenard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a switch on the panel by the elevator.  The IRIS starts closing on Bond... \nINT. PASSAGEWAY \nBond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he shot lunges.  Clings to him. \nBond hits him away, he LEAPS for the cart blocking his way and SHOVES IT INTO THE IRIS DOOR just as it almost closes... \nBond squeezes through... \nINT. OTHER SIDE OF IRIS \nRenard is getting in the ELEVATOR.  Sees Bond made it, fires. Bond rolls into a corner. \nRENARD We have our fireworks.  Now you can have yours. \nAnd he machine-guns some barrels.  Rocket fuel spills out. He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the metal so more fuel cascades out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CATWALK ABOVE PIT \nChristmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her IRIS DOOR OPENS... \nAT THE ELEVATOR \nBond fires at Renard, hitting his shin... \nWITH RENARD \nlooking down at his shin, noticing the blood.  Inconvenienced but not in pain.  He shuts the cage doors.  Pauses only to fire off half a clip at the SWITCH PANEL.  Shreds it. \nBond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile. He POINTS DOWN...underneath him... \nBond looks down. \nHIS P.O.V.  BENEATH THE ELEVATOR...A makeshift explosive device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set to explode \nEyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires. \nINT. LIFT SHAFT \nThe pipe bomb ticking... \nINT. PASSAGEWAY BY ELEVATOR \nBond is trapped.  He looks up... \nTHE PULLEY HOOK HANGS DOWN... \nHe jumps up, grabbing it, just as... \nKABOOM! \nThe bomb ignites the spilled oil, A FIREBALL shoots along, scorching after Bond, who is SAILING THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY, the force of the blast sending him hurling down the passageway ON THE PULLEY...heading straight for: \nA CLOSED IRIS DOOR which miraculously begins to OPEN as he SHOOTS THROUGH... \nAhead, the next door is OPEN as well. He sees CHRISTMAS on the other side... \nHER P.O.V.  Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a MASSIVE FIREBALL... \nBOND Close the door!  Close the door! \nBut before she can, two of the FUEL BARRELS HURTLE through the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire below. \nFlames licking up the sides of the pit toward them. \nBond looks up, sees the ARM OF THE ROBOT LIFTER, stretching upward toward an old SHAFT t the top of the ceiling... \nHe and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the spider-like web that supported the bomb and find... \nAN OLD ELEVATOR...powered by a hydraulic system... \nThey get in...hear the rumbling of the fire below...the old elevator moves slowly...the rumbling grows louder... \nBOND Shame you had to spot I wasn't the real thing. \nCHRISTMAS So who are you? \nBOND Bond -- \nBond FIRES HIS GUN at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and... \nTHE ELEVATOR shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as \nBELOW THEM...THE PIT EXPLODES... \nINT. ELEVATOR \nFire shoots up. Bond lunges to cover Christmas. As the smoke clears: \nBOND (finishing) James Bond. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MESA - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - CONTINUOUS \nChristmas and Bond climb out of the duct.  Through a cloud of dust he can see people running about, panicked.  There's been some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground. \nBond looks past them to a plane coming this way.  The plane. It roars past, level with them.  He follows it with his eyes, helpless as it gets smaller and smaller... \nBOND Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard? \nELEKTRA ...what? \nBOND We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me... \nElektra stands...she begins to tremble. \nELEKTRA Are you saying...Renard is the man who's trying to kill me? \nBOND You can drop the act, it's over. \nELEKTRA I don't know what you're talking about! \nBOND I think you do. \nHe walks toward her, threatening... \nBOND At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome. It's common in kidnappings.  A young impressionable victim. Sheltered, sexually inexperienced. A powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, in manipulation. Something snaps in the victim's mind. The captive falls in love with her captor. \nAt the word \"love,\" Elektra explodes.  She SLAPS an unsuspecting Bond hard across the face. \nELEKTRA How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn't have to sleep with you to find that out. \nBOND He used your exact words. \nELEKTRA You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike? \nHe has no answer.  He can't deny what she says. \nThe phone rings, cuts through the tension.  Bond and Elektra staring at one another.  She lets it ring...  Then picks up. Listens, looks to Bond. \nELEKTRA He's struck again. (beat) Five men are dead at the pipeline. \nHe moves toward her. \nBOND I'm coming with you. \nELEKTRA You do what you have to do, but I've called in M.  She's en route from London even now. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - DAY \nThe MI-6 chopper lands.  We can see M through the window. Face set hard. \nEXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - MOMENTS LATER \nSCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked around a medium-sized industrial plant. \nBond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices. All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area. \nM (to Bond) Glad to see you've turned up. \nHe is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency. \nBOND They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a scientist here from the International Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.  She has ten crews combing the area. \nThey step out of the bright sunlight and into \nEXT.\\INT. CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS \nFIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers.  M surveys the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters. \nELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman explain what's happening.  She nods acknowledgement to M. \nTanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone: \nTANNER I'll see how they're coming with the power... \nThey watch him go.  M turns to Bond: \nM You had your hand on the bomb and you let Renard get away with it. \nHe draws her away, to a small alcove.  Takes something out of his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD. \nBOND The report King bought. It's a manual. Renard's men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead. \nM Then Robert was right about a Russian connection. \nBOND They're getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can't help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin... \nM The inside man? \nBOND Is maybe...the inside woman. \nNOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity of their exchange.  The room is lined with MONITORS and a huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path. \nM A woman? \nBut before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her. \nELEKTRA That's not right. \nA Technician comes over.  Tanner too, followed by Bond and M. \nTANNER What is it? \nELEKTRA It's an observation and repair rig. Travels along the pipe, checks for broken seals.  But it's not supposed to be there. \nBOND (thinks) Stop it. \nBond and Christmas waiting expectantly.  Tense silence. \nFinally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER.  Lights appear behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig tearing through the pipe. \nBond looks over his shoulder at Christmas' speedometer...she's only at fifty... \nBOND Faster! Get our speed up! \nChristmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer... \nBond's rig jolts as the other makes contact.  He cushions the blow with his feet.  Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across. \nThe bomb sits there, daunting, deadly. \nCHRISTMAS Tactical fission device.  Low yield. \nThey look at one another, then set straight to work. \nINT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS \nThe room is quiet, tense.  M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor, the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the doors. They are the only ones left.  Going down with the ship...if it goes.  M and Elektra watch the two lights now together on the console.  A tense silence.  Everyone's edgy. Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest.  She exchanges a glance with Gabor. \nINT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY \nCLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB:  the timer.  1:45 MINUTES. \nBond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're attempting.  The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29... \nOMITTED 217-218 \nINT. PIPELINE - DAY \nThe rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see.  But WHOOSH!  As the rigs hurtle past... \nINT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY \nThe pipe suddenly dips.  They cling on as the machine bucks like a rollercoaster.  Back on a straight... \nHer brow furrows. \nCHRISTMAS The plutonium is missing.  They've taken the core! \nBOND Then it's no longer a bomb? \nCHRISTMAS (back to work, urgent) It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if the trigger charge goes off... \nBond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel. \nHe stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43...  Makes a decision. \nBOND Let it blow. \nChristmas shoots a look, astonished. \nCHRISTMAS But we can stop it. \nTaking her arm... \nBOND Let it blow. \nShe can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead. \nBOND Trust me.  Leave it. \nHe grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb. \nINT. PIPELINE - DAY \nThe rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking her with him.  They tumble along the pipe.  Agile, Bond springs to his feet, pulls her up.  They run like hell for the hatch, into the darkness... \nEXT. PIPELINE - DAY \nThe pipeline.  A long beat, then... \nKABOOM!!  A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in every direction. \nAs the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has been destroyed. \nOMIT 223 \nINT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME \nOn the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP.... \nThe watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio earpiece in his ear, reports information. \nGABOR It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud. The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline... \nM And Bond? \nAn agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies. \nGABOR Nothing. \nM and Elektra share a look. \nELEKTRA Do you think he's dead? \nM can't answer.  She shakes her head. \nM We just have to wait. \nELEKTRA You're hurting me. \nHe senses something different between them.  She tries to hide it. \nELEKTRA Brought me something? \nHe smiles, grabs a case off one of his men, opens it up, pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal. \nShe looks at it with wary fascination. \nRENARD Go on.  It's safe.  Touch your destiny. \nShe traces a finger along the metal.  A flicker of wonder: \nELEKTRA Warm. \nRENARD (pointed) Is it? \nShe's sensitive to his buried frustration: \nELEKTRA I've brought something for you as well. \nINT. ROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER \nElektra opens a heavy door, she and Renard past through to... \nA SMALL ROOM...a window set in the stone on one side.  The other side is divided off by a WALL OF BARS, creating a cell which now contains: M \nThe cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner. M betrays no fear.  A quiet defiance burns in her. \nELEKTRA Just as I promised. \nRenard steps forward.  Bars separate him from M. \nRENARD My executioner. \nM Over-praise, I'm afraid.  But my people will finish the job. \nELEKTRA Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn't think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market. \nM Your father... \nELEKTRA Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back. \nElektra leaves.  Renard is left alone with M. \nM She's insane.  Is that what you did to her? \nRENARD No. I'm afraid it is what you did. \nHe crosses close to the bars. \nRENARD When I took her she was...promise itself. So clever, so vibrant, so...full of life force. And you left her there, at the mercy of a man like me. You ruined her. For what?  To get to me? She is worth fifty of me. \nM For once, I agree with you. \nHe shakes his head, amused by her pluck. \nM So she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father, on me. \nRENARD No. I wanted you. I wanted you for myself. \nHe takes something out of his pocket.  A small TRAVEL CLOCK. He sets it. \nRENARD Since you sent your man to kill me, I have been watching time tick slowly away, marching inevitably toward my own death. Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow, your time is up. And I guarantee you...I will not miss.  You will die. Along with everyone in this city and the future of the West. \nHe places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach through her bars.  He leaves.  We hold on the clock: \nEight p.m. \nEXT. CITY OF WALKWAYS - BAKU - DUSK (OLD SC. 174) \nValentin Zukovsky in the back of his chauffeured Rolls Royce...  We PULL BACK, to take in an amazing sight:  the car is on a network of raised walkways and platforms that extends as far as the eye can see.  A decaying legacy of the Soviet years. \nEXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.175) \nZukovsky limps purposefully away from his Rolls along a walkway leading to a Beluga fishery built over the water. \nINT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.176) \nNailed on the battered old door, the lid of a caviar jar, a label illustrated with a LINE DRAWING OF ZUKOVSKY. Zukovsky opens the door and finds himself... \nStaring straight down Bond's pistol.  Bond and Christmas are silhouetted by the gold dusk light.  At their feet lies one of Zukovsky's workers. \nZUKOVSKY What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing? \nBOND She's no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant. \nZUKOVSKY Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship. \nHands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening dress decidedly out of place here. \nZUKOVSKY Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears? \nBOND What's your business with Elektra King? \nZUKOVSKY I thought you were the one in her business. \nBOND She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn't even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for? \nZUKOVSKY As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks. \nZUKOVSKY Any luck reaching Yevgeny? \nOPERATOR Negative, comrade. \nHe moves to CHRISTMAS AND BOND, pouring over a large MAP OF ISTANBUL spread out on a table. \nCHRISTMAS (to Zukovsky) What is this place? \nZUKOVSKY Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit. \nBond notices THE BOA in the corner with some others. \nBOND Your old friend Dmitri. \nZukovsky nods to his old friend. \nZUKOVSKY Today, you are glad to have the Boa  on your side. \nZukovsky looks at the map. \nZUKOVSKY In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo. \nCHRISTMAS What class sub does your nephew run? \nZUKOVSKY C-class. \nBOND Nuclear. \nCHRISTMAS Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor. (the penny drops) He's not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub's reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown. \nBOND Made to look just like an accident. \nZUKOVSKY Mother of God. \nBOND The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea. \nCHRISTMAS But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe... \nBOND (chilled) Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world... \nCHRISTMAS The King pipeline. \nBOND Elektra would control it all. \nZUKOVSKY If what you say it true...it may be too late for Yevgeny. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY \nThe ancient arched underbelly of a waterside building. \nSomething is disturbing a large expanse of water.  A black shadow looms beneath the waves.  A SUBMARINE SURFACES. \nINT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY \nWaiting at the newly excavated quay:  Renard and his men. \nThe submarine's hatch opens.  A YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN EMERGES, vaguely resembling his uncle, Zukovsky. \nRENARD Captain... \nYEVGENY Sir. We are ready to load your cargo. We only have a few hours before we'll be missed. \nRENARD You came with a skeleton crew? \nYEVGENY That's all we can afford these days. \nRENARD Of course. We are grateful for your efforts. \nOne of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy and other food. \nRENARD We have brandy and other refreshments for your men. \nThe Captain nods, pleased. \nINT. DYE FACTORY \nBond and Christmas and Zukovsky watch as the radio operators scan the airwaves. \nZUKOVSKY If we're not in time and something has happened to him... you must let me kill them. \nBond stares hard at him.  A long beat. \nBOND Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky.  They have M. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBMARINE - DAY \nEerie, dark, the lights inside green and sickly. \nCLOSE ON \nA half-eaten sandwich. An empty glass of brandy on the floor, just near the hand it fell from... \nPULL BACK TO SEE \nThe dead face of Yevgeny, poisoned.  Others of his crew around, also dead. \nRenard and his men tour the grisly scene. \nBOND If I don't get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden's Tower, M is dead. \nBond runs out, into \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTeeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF. \nBond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the top of the roof... \nBoa has now been joined by THREE THUGS.  One attacks Bond as the Boa and the others move away... \nBond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof, gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls... \nEXT. BAZAAR \nInto the market below. \nChristmas, just coming into the square, sees the body falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond... \nBut the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth. \nShe turns and runs...the thug gives chase... \nON THE ROOFS ABOVE \nBond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of... \nEXT. MOVING BUS \nMotoring rapidly away from him.  He makes a spectacular leap to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus, dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks. \nON THE BUS \nBond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him. They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy over... \nThe thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS... \nBond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with his gun when... \nTHE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly ELECTROCUTED. \nThug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE BUS... \nEXT. STREET \nThug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR. \nON THE BUS \nBond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them. \nThe bus is hissing to a stop. \nThe Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.  Bond rushes forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.  The taxi jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to the street.  He springs to his feet. \nFifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for traffic.  The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley. \nEXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY \nThe Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water pipes and drink coffee.  The Boa is nowhere to be seen. \nBond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the cafe. \nEXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY \nBond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the back.  He looks inside - just a few children  at play.  Bond is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun - but the Boa knocks it out of his hand. \nThe Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail. He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach. \nBond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it. Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear. \nBOA For years I was told I could never take the great James Bond and his Walther PPK. What good is your gun now, Bond? \nBond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.  He slumps forward, his left hand touches something hot.  It's the iron basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.  Bond's fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.  He grabs it and with his last reserves - \nSwings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT SKILLET. \nThe Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of his face.  Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying to clear his head. \nThe Boa runs out the back door.  Bond finds his gun, holsters it and follows. \nEXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY \nBond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND SHOPPERS.  Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the crowd to... \nEXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY \nRUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.  Bond enters square in time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian steamer. \nAs the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom. \nEXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY \nBoa, breathing hard gets to the deck.  He lumbers across it but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck house.  The Boa goes sprawling.  As Bond comes for him he scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and swings at Bond.  But Bond is ready for him.  He wards off the blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.  He traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks in the solar plexus.  He Boa stages back to the railing.  A final kick from Bond sends him over the side... \nTHE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A SICKENING THUD. \nBond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his neck broken. \nBond sighs, turns... \nShe fingers the bolt.  Prepares to turn it the last time...His hand strains at its binding... \nBOND One... last... screw? \nELEKTRA (kissing his ear) Oh James. \nShe begins to turn the screw... \n... when SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are heard outside. \nBond is on the edge of consciousness. \nElektra freezes.  Gets off him.  Moves to a window. \nEXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY HER POV: \nBig, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of his men.  Two bodies in his trail.  He's on course for Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire. \nINT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY \nElektra moves to her gun.  Just then, Gabor crashes through a stained glass window, neck broken. \nTWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors burst open.  Zukovsky stands there.  A bloody giant. \nThey open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder.  Right now, he's unstoppable. \nA shocked silence after the shooting.  He eyes Bond in the chair.  To the room: \nZUKOVSKY I'm looking for a submarine.  It's big and black, and the driver is a friend of mine. \nThen his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from below.  He knows at once what it means. \nZUKOVSKY Bring it to me. \nShe picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun beneath it).  She proffers the hat... \nELEKTRA What a shame.  You just missed him. \nBLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat. \nHe staggers back.  Stares.  Slumps down.  Lowers his head to the ground. \nShe walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down, smiling a half-psychotic smile.  The gun is pinned. \nZukovsky is dying. \nBut he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going to shoot Bond! \nBond stares back.  Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for extreme accuracy... \nBLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist.  Splinters the wood there. \nELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky.  She didn't see where the bullet went, just that it missed Bond.  She watches his head slump further, staring at Bond... \nA look passes between the two men.  Comrades in arms.  The merest of smiles.  Then the light fades from his eyes.  Dead. \nELEKTRA \nturns back to Bond.  Smiles. \nELEKTRA Excuse me. \nShe picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it: \nELEKTRA Everything's under control up here.  Are you ready? \nRENARD (filtered) Yes.  Au revoir... \nLost for a moment, she breathes heavily.  She glances at Zukovsky's corpse.  Slightly puzzled, to Bond: \nELEKTRA Zukovsky really hated you. (beat) Time to say goodnight. \nAnd she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer twist... \nOne super-fast movement: \nBond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight.  He holds her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls her backwards, her hand scratching at his face. \nRipping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet.  Moves to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his fingers. \nTurns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs.  A moment's dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to Elektra? \nHe takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY \nThe submarine's engines roar to life. \nINT. TOWER - CONTINUOUS \nELEKTRA rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading to the various balconies of the minaret tower. \nINT. TOWER/M'S CELL - DAY \nBond stalks up after her.  THEIR VOICES ECHO through the intertwined stairs: \nELEKTRA James.  You can't kill me.  Not in cold blood. \nBut Bond isn't wavering.  Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun. \nINT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE LOWER DECK - MOMENTS LATER \nBond and Christmas get attacked.  A vicious, silent fight... Then the radio set sparks into life -- \nRENARD Open the tanks. \nBond is throttling the man with the cable.  Speaks into the handset. \nBOND (disguising voice) Tanks open. \nBut the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm: \nThe KLAXON RESOUNDS. \nINT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRenard looks up. \nRENARD (to self) Bond... \nHe flicks a switch; \nRENARD (into mic) Bond! You have decided to join me on this historic voyage.  Welcome to my nuclear family. \nINTERCUT: \nBOND ON AN INTERCOM: \nHis voice fills the control room. \nBOND You're really going to commit suicide for her? \nRenard responds, into the microphone. \nRENARD In case you've forgotten.  I'm dead already. \nBOND Haven't you heard the news?  So is she. \nRenard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he could feel in his skin...he SCREAMS... \nINT. SUBMARINE... \nThe scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the doomed craft. \nBACK ON RENARD, gasping, spent. \nRENARD You will die for this. \nHe strides through to the \nINT. REACTOR CHAMBER \nJams shut the hatch behind him.  Now moves through to the \nINT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR \nWhere he picks up the PLUTONIUM. Moves back into the \nINT. REACTOR CHAMBER \nSealing the other door behind him.  And now he opens up the cover of the glaring REACTOR... \nINT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nChristmas sees a panel light up: \nCHRISTMAS The cover is off the reactor. \nBond reads off more lights... \nBOND He's sealed himself in. \nCHRISTMAS He's going to insert the plutonium. \nThinking fast, Bond moves to some controls.  Hits switches. \nCHRISTMAS Do you know what you're doing? \nBOND Like riding a bike. \nINT. AIR TANKS, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nThe air tanks immediately filling with water. \nINT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nChristmas and Bond shift to the side.  Everything not screwed down starts sliding... \nEXT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS - LONG SHOT \nThe submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose dropping down and down... \nPretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a submarine hanging vertically, nose down. \nINT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nRenard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the nearest wall. \nINT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nBond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip.  He helps her up. \nINT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nChristmas, shivering in the rising water. \nCHRISTMAS Twenty. \nShe presses a button... \nINT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water. The hatch closes. \nThe whole world is at a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses. \nINT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS \nBathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor, Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of the door... \nKER-BLAM!  A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. \nThe door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond. \nBond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard, now a crumpled heap in the corner. \nBond moves down to the next door, opens it: \nBOND Christmas! \nAnd there she is, struggling, the water level way below still rising... \nHe lowers an arm, pulls her up. \nThey clamber up to the reactor: \nINT. REACTOR CHAMBER \nBOND'S POV: in the intense glow inside -- the overheating rod, protruding slightly. \nCHRISTMAS We have to get the rod out of the reactor! \nINT. REACTOR CHAMBER \nBond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD. Christmas comes up level with him: \nCHRISTMAS Melting down.  4000 degrees, the Zirconium casings on the rods crack. 5000, the plutonium melts.  In ten minutes, a hydrogen explosion. \nTHE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING... \nHe starts toward the reactor when suddenly \nRENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM. \nCHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life. \nTHE GAUGE HITS 4700 \nBOND AND RENARD \nstruggle...  Both slamming into switches and buttons. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED 314-316 \nINT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS \nTHE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900, EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK 5000 MARK.  Meltdown imminent... \nHe looks down the sub -- more water racing upward... \nBack to the pile.  Scans the scene, searching for an idea. Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure.  Thinks fast.  Grabs the hose, snaps it free... \nRENARD \nis recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him.  Raises it to Bond... \nBOND'S POV \nin the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from 5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us... \nBOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past -- impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot. \nRenard stares at Bond in horror.  Bond calmly takes the flare gun off him. \nBOND She's waiting for you. \nAnd he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water. \nChristmas looks down at the floating corpse. \nBond watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000. \nThe nuclear disaster looks like it's averted.  But suddenly water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's shell; it's going to sink. \nBOND We're sinking. \nBut she won't come.  As water courses over them: \nCHRISTMAS Help me.  We have to seal it. \nShe moves to the reactor, closing the cover.  Bond uses his strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place. \n", "test1_input": "BOND I have to go. \nELEKTRA Then take me with you. \nBOND No. You'll be safe here. \nELEKTRA I don't want to be safe! \nBOND I have to go to work. \nHe starts toward the door. \nELEKTRA Now who's the coward? \nHe stops, his back up...then heads out the door. \nIN THE HALLWAY \nHe passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside. \nCUT TO: \nEST. SHOT - EXT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT \nElegant, mysterious.  A modern day Casablanca. \nINT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT \nBond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino. He takes out the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room -- \nHIS X-RAY POV \nHe can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players.  All sizes of pistol, even the odd grenade.  The obvious side-effect of this view -- he can see through clothes. \nHis eyes alight on two girls walking away from him.  One of them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display.  She returns Bond's smile.  Her friend turns to look.  Bond's smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one breast. \nINT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT \nHe looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes. His old adversary, ex-KGB, VALENTIN ZUKOVSKY, talking to some suspicious types. Zukovsky looks across. Bond walks toward him. \nBOND Valentin Zukovsky. \nZUKOVSKY BondJamesBond. What brings you here? \nBOND You, of course. I need some information. \nZUKOVSKY Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family's, now it's mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble... \nBOND (looking about) Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat's nest. \nZUKOVSKY (offering hors d'ouevres) Have some of the rat's nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House. \nHe turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy. \nZUKOVSKY Let me introduce you to a former colleague of mine at the KGB. Dmitri Palov, you may know him as...the Boa. \nThe Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands. \nBOA The great 007. For years I have dreamed of closing my hands around your neck. \nBOND Boa. Have you had any therapy since Perestroika? \nZUKOVSKY Why am I suddenly worried I'm not carrying enough insurance? \nThe Boa leaves, glaring all the while. \nZUKOVSKY See?  You're upsetting my customers. What do you want? \nBOND How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons? \nZUKOVSKY What?  This is not possible. \nBond takes from his pocket the fragment of the PARACHUTE. Zukovsky examines the letters. \nBOND If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division. \nZUKOVSKY Where did you get this? \nBOND Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me. \nZukovsky shakes his head. Sighs. \nZUKOVSKY The Russian Army, they spend millions on flying skis, but they cannot afford to pay the soldiers. The men, they do what they have to do to feed their families. In this country, for the right price and a pack of cigarettes, you can get anything you want. \nHe notices Bond watching THE HOSTESS BAR...a dark alcove of the casino, where slinky HOOKERS flatter the guests. \nZUKOVSKY That too. Everyone does what they can to survive. \nBOND How high up does this...arms dealing go? \nZUKOVSKY Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you. \nBOND But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline. \nThis hits Zukovsky. He closes down. A chill between them. \nZUKOVSKY Poor Bond. The cold war is over.  What have you got left? Economic espionage. Murder in the boardroom.  So dull. \nBond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino. \nHIS POV:  ELEKTRA...more vibrant than we have ever seen her, living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a sparkling dress that fits like second skin.  Her hair is full and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild. \n", "test1_true": "Bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and turns away, making her way to the Roulette tables. \nBond follows her across the casino. They are like two cats, moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and sexy, all eyes on them. He takes note as she passes...MINIMUM $100, then $500, $1000... \nShe finally stops at the 'No limit' table.  Crowded with the nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks, South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink. \nZUKOVSKY is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the center. \nZUKOVSKY We've kept your father's chair free. \nELEKTRA And his account? \nZUKOVSKY You have a credit line of a million and a half. \nHe gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of CHIPS toward her. A WAITRESS is right there to take her order. \nELEKTRA Vodka martini. \nBOND Two. Shaken not stirred. \nHe leans in, smiling his charming smile as he says: \nBOND What the hell are you doing here? \nELEKTRA (smiling right back) Someone wants to kill me, I'd rather die looking him straight in the eye. (lightly) What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one? \nShe points to a SHOW GIRL in a feather headdress and pasties. \nBOND If this little show is for my benefit, I'll take you home right now. \nELEKTRA You had your chance, James. Now I'm looking for a bigger thrill. \nShe pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them stand on her bet.  The whole table exhales. Then, it starts: bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival. \nBond scans the room, vigilant, nervous... \nHIS P.O.V.  He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this way and that...he looks suspicious as hell. \nBond watches, his blood running, and then... \nDavidov slips into the HOSTESS BAR.  A HOOKER is soon wrapping herself around him. After a few words, she leads him off toward the back. \nBond returns to the game, shaking his head.  He watches as THE DEALER DEALS FROM THE SHOE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALON PRIV\u0090 - NIGHT \nA small room.  Lit by sconces that sport LIVE FLAMES.  Tacky- luxurious, a refracted Eastern reflection on an old west whore house. \nDavidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove.  He faces a small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see THE HOOKER behind him, on the bed. \nHOOKER You want to be...on top, or not on top? \nDAVIDOV On top. \nShe slowly pulls a pair of SILK ROPES out from her bra and DANGLES THEM. \nHOOKER Tied up, or not tied up? \nDavidov smiles, struggling with his belt.  He looks down, gets it, looks up...his heart stops...it is not the hooker in the mirror but... \nRENARD'S FRIGHTENING FACE. \nDavidov spins. \nHIS P.O.V.  Renard's henchman stands by the door, an automatic rifle cocked at Davidov. \nRENARD Dead, or not dead? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE \nElektra with black king showing. A seven beneath. \nBOND I understand it's normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end. \nELEKTRA Really? \nAnd with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a hit.  The Dealer gives her an eight.  She reveals her cards. \nDEALER Bust. \nHe rakes in her chips. But Elektra is undeterred.  She pushes another pile forward as the next deal commences. \nELEKTRA I like the deep end, James. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALON PRIVE \nThe HENCHMAN holds Davidov against the wall with his huge fist around his neck.  Near his head, the live flame of a SCONCE hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it. \nThe HOOKER, obviously one of Renard's gang, has finished donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun onto her shoulder. \nRenard looks distastefully at the room. \nRENARD Is this how you spend the money I pay you? And with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men? \n", "test1_id": 540, "test2_input": "Bond flicks a switch.  A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from the BMW to the window of the office.  He can HEAR a synthesis of Davidov's voice... \nDAVIDOV (V.O.) I'm running late...no, no, I'll make it...how will they know I'm your man?...romashka...romashka...alright. \nBond hears the click of a phone hanging up.  He flicks another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system activates in his WINDSCREEN... \nHe can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK. \nHe goes back inside. \nBOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the lock on the trunk.  It pops open. \nBond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside: \nA MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD EYES. \nBond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket. \nIt has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it. \nAT THE OFFICE \nDavidov is coming out... \nBond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car. \nAT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE \nDavidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then... \nHE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear... \nTHE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever was. \nDavidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT \nThe Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared airstrip. \nINT. CAR \nDavidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded area. \nEXT. CAR \nDavidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and opens the trunk. \nHe removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but something is different, the clothes not quite right and then: \nTHE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps... \nIt IS JAMES BOND. \nBOND Problem, comrade? \nDavidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes go wide and he crumbles, dead. \nBond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov. \nBOND Old habits die hard. \nHe straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He opens the lock. \nINSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags -- and a polaroid-type camera. \nHe picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in 'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass. \nBond goes to look in the dufflebag but... \nA PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP. \nHIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees, flying low, its red landing lights blinking. \nEXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT \nA door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits in the doorway. \nBOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking into. \nBOND Here goes nothing. \nHe hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to the plane.  He starts up the steps: \nTHE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him IN RUSSIAN. \nBond pauses.  And then, thinking, says: \nBOND Romashka. \nThe soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon. \nINT. PLANE \nFour soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a big, thick-necked tough. \nThey all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY. \nThe Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that sounds like...\"where's the rest?\" \n", "test2_true": "The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out shoes to the rest of the guys. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN \nA red dawn.  Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly- shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip.  The plane approaching. \nINT. PLANE - LANDING \nThe three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat amongst themselves. \nBond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly cargo. There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he clearly recognizes:  DANGER - RADIOACTIVE. \nBond looks out of the window.  Beneath a huge MESA, a huddle of low buildings. \nThey come to a stop near the end of the runway.  A SMALL JEEP is driving out to them. \nOne of the soldiers throws something to Bond. An ORANGE JUMPSUIT that says Miratom on the breast.  He catches it. \nPILOT (subtitles) You have fifteen minutes. \nEXT. AIRSTRIP/VALLEY/TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN \nBond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley - \nKABOOM! \nA cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side of the hill. \nEXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY \nThey turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around, IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and personnel quietly going about their business.  A vast protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building. \nINT. 'BUBBLE' - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY (CHRISTMAS JONES') POV: \nThe sound of breathing LOUD, we're looking from inside the visor of a protective suit.  It's hard to tell what's going on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue plutonium from inside a corroding WARHEAD... \nEXT. FACILITY - SAME \nAn officer eyes Bond's pass. \nCOLONEL AKAKIEVICH (subtitles) You are late. The transport documents? \nBond shows him the case.  Akakievich examines the documents. \nCOLONEL AKAKIEVICH (subtitles) They are waiting for you below.  It should be ready. Check with the IDA physicist. \nHe points toward the \"bubble.\" \nInside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box. \nAs Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit. \nMoving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN GIRL.  CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish hair, hot right now.  In one movement she unzips and steps out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off shorts, heavy duty boots.  A nasty-looking hunting knife strapped around her hips.  She has a deep tan and an incredible figure. \nShe grabs a bottle of water, guzzles. \nBond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly, also unable to take his eyes off her.  He spits on the floor and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear. \nCOLONEL AKAKIEVICH Not interested in men. Take my word for it. \nAkakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker.  Bond offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away. \nChristmas approaches.  He notices her IDA tag -- and an incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking him out as well. \nCHRISTMAS You new? \nBOND (Russian accent) Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...? \nCHRISTMAS Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I've heard them all. \nBOND Don't know any doctor jokes. \nShe is wary.  It's been a long time since a man this attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the building. \nCHRISTMAS What happened to Len Tashka? \nBOND Couldn't make it. Splitting headache. \nCHRISTMAS The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun. \nBond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS. \nBOND Will I need protection? \nShe squints at him, taken aback. \nCHRISTMAS There's no radiation danger down there. \nBond turns to go, knowing he misstepped.  Christmas then speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN. \nCHRISTMAS (subtitles) Where is this stockpile going? \nBond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN. \nBOND (subtitles) To the nuclear facility at Penza 19. \nShe nods. Watches him disappear into the building. \n", "test2_id": 541, "test3_input": "Zukovsky dives away -- into a CAVIAR PIT.

Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff. \nBOND And the payoff on the tables? \nZUKOVSKY A special job.  A...a...a submarine. \nCHRISTMAS What? \nZUKOVSKY To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet. \nBOND Where's the sub going?! \nZUKOVSKY No!  Get me out! \nBOND This is too big for even you.  Where is it? \nZUKOVSKY This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out! \nBut he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger. \nZUKOVSKY No! Bond! \nCHRISTMAS (alarmed) Bond! \nBond fires.  Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM. \nIt takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him.  He clings to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to safety. \nCHRISTMAS Commander Bond, you are dangerous, unpredictable, and a hothead. \nHe just looks at her. \nCHRISTMAS But then again, explosive devices are my specialty. \nZukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea. \nZUKOVSKY So.

But my people will finish the job. \nELEKTRA Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn't think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market. \nM Your father... \nELEKTRA Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother.

Is that what you did to her? \nRENARD No. I'm afraid it is what you did. \nHe crosses close to the bars. \nRENARD When I took her she was...promise itself.

She is worth fifty of me. \nM For once, I agree with you. \nHe shakes his head, amused by her pluck. \nM So she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father, on me. \nRENARD No. I wanted you. I wanted you for myself. \nHe takes something out of his pocket.  A small TRAVEL CLOCK. He sets it. \nRENARD Since you sent your man to kill me, I have been watching time tick slowly away, marching inevitably toward my own death. Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow, your time is up.

At their feet lies one of Zukovsky's workers. \nZUKOVSKY What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing? \nBOND She's no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant. \nZUKOVSKY Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship. \nHands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening dress decidedly out of place here. \nZUKOVSKY Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears? \nBOND What's your business with Elektra King? \nZUKOVSKY I thought you were the one in her business. \nBOND She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House.

Tell us, before its too late. \nBut it may be already: \nThe SOUND OF A HELICOPTER.  Zukovsky frowns, the SOUND GETTING LOUDER -- \nBond is the first to move as -- \nINT.

RAMP TO LOWER WALKWAY (OLD SC. 180) \nBond makes for his BMW, running down a flight of steps, onto a lower walkway when...THE SECTION AHEAD OF HIM EXPLODES...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a thrown grenade.  Bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the only way out is ALONG THE PIPELINES...he runs along a narrow section of pipe and then JUMPS DOWN to another walkway.  The PIPES are now above him...the chopper's relentless saws CUT THROUGH THE PIPE...GAS JETS OUT...Bond HURLS HIMSELF up a stairway. \nINT. CAVIAR FISHERY \nZukovsky and Christmas watch in horror as Chopper One blades away more roof above them. \nEXT. LOWER WALKWAY \nBond takes something out of his pocket, a remote control device...he presses some buttons...HIS CAR COMES TO LIFE...lights on, it drives toward him. \nHe rushes to meet it. Chopper Two follows behind Bond, slicing up the walkway just behind him.  Bond gets to the car and JUMPS IN as the chopper veers away. \nINT. CAR \nBond activates his missile device as he watches Chopper Two pass behind the factory.  Suddenly there's a huge roar behind him as the blades from Chopper One RIP THROUGH THE ROOF, SLICING HIS CAR IN HALF. \nBut Bond is undeterred.  He sets off the missile toward the disappearing Chopper One. \nEXT. CHOPPER \nA DIRECT HIT. Chopper One explodes and falls onto the walkway setting the scene ablaze. \nEXT. WALKWAYS - SAME \nZukovsky and Christmas see the explosion, then see Chopper Two dropped FOUR ARMED MEN onto a nearby walkway.  The men make their way toward the factory, firing at the guards. Zukovsky and Christmas are forced inside. \nANGLE ON BOND \nWho sees the danger to the others and runs off along the walkways back to the factory.  The Chopper follows him, shooting. \nBond outruns it, until, ahead of him A GRENADE EXPLODES, destroying the walkway and hurling Bond into the water. \nEXT. FACTORY \nThe gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's guards. Then, two of the assailants follow ZUKOVSKY and CHRISTMAS into... \nINT.

FACTORY \nBond finishes off the remaining two armed men in a furious gunfight and exits. \nEXT. WALKWAYS - SAME \nBond sees Zukovsky and Christmas swimming to safety.  The chopper bears down on him.  He leaps back to what's left of the building, picks up a flare gun.  He jumps down to a walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted GAS JET...he then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it approaches Bond for the kill.... \nBond fires the flare gun... \nTHE GAS EXPLODES! \nThe Chopper tries to pull away, but it's too late.  The flames engulf it, igniting a fireball. \nIN THE WATER \nZukovsky pulls himself back onto a walkway and heads for the factory, but speeding at him are to FREE-FLYING SAW BLADES from the chopper that has just exploded! \nOMITTED 231S to 231Z \nEXT.

Gets off him.  Moves to a window. \nEXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY HER POV: \nBig, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of his men.  Two bodies in his trail.  He's on course for Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire. \nINT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY \nElektra moves to her gun.  Just then, Gabor crashes through a stained glass window, neck broken. \nTWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors burst open.  Zukovsky stands there.  A bloody giant. \nThey open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder.  Right now, he's unstoppable. \nA shocked silence after the shooting.  He eyes Bond in the chair.  To the room: \nZUKOVSKY I'm looking for a submarine.  It's big and black, and the driver is a friend of mine. \nThen his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from below.  He knows at once what it means. \nZUKOVSKY Bring it to me. \nShe picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun beneath it).  She proffers the hat... \nELEKTRA What a shame.  You just missed him. \nBLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat. \nHe staggers back.  Stares.  Slumps down.  Lowers his head to the ground. \nShe walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down, smiling a half-psychotic smile.  The gun is pinned. \nZukovsky is dying. \nBut he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going to shoot Bond! \nBond stares back.  Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for extreme accuracy... \nBLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist.  Splinters the wood there. \nELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky.  She didn't see where the bullet went, just that it missed Bond.  She watches his head slump further, staring at Bond... \nA look passes between the two men.  Comrades in arms.  The merest of smiles.  Then the light fades from his eyes.  Dead. \nELEKTRA \nturns back to Bond.  Smiles. \nELEKTRA Excuse me. \nShe picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it: \nELEKTRA Everything's under control up here.  Are you ready? \nRENARD (filtered) Yes.  Au revoir... \nLost for a moment, she breathes heavily.  She glances at Zukovsky's corpse.  Slightly puzzled, to Bond: \nELEKTRA Zukovsky really hated you. (beat) Time to say goodnight. \nAnd she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer twist... \nOne super-fast movement: \nBond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight.  He holds her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls her backwards, her hand scratching at his face. \nRipping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet.  Moves to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his fingers. \nTurns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs.  A moment's dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to Elektra? \nHe takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY \nThe submarine's engines roar to life. \nINT. TOWER - CONTINUOUS \nELEKTRA rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading to the various balconies of the minaret tower. \nINT. TOWER/M'S CELL - DAY \nBond stalks up after her.

It affords a spectacular view of Istanbul.  Bond appears, has her cornered. \nBOND Call him off. \nHe holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth. \nBOND I won't ask again.  Call him off! \nShe looks at him seriously.  He's giving her a last chance, willing her to save herself and the city. \nELEKTRA (into walkie-talkie) Renard. \nBond waits... \nELEKTRA (to Bond) You wouldn't kill me.  You'd miss me. \nAnd her face breaks into a perverted grin and -- \nELEKTRA (into walkie-talkie) Dive!  Bond -- \nBLAM!  Bond shoots her. \nShe staggers back, shocked at her own mortality. \nBOND I never miss. \nHe looks out: \nEXT. BOSPHORUS - DAY \nSees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half submerged.  The hatch is still open. \nINT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY \nHe stares at her dead body a beat. And then, he crouches. He touches her cheek, just once, before he goes. \nBehind him, unbeknownst, M has seen it all. \nEXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY \nHe moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and \nDIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water.  Amazing. \nEXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - DAY \nHe surfaces close to the exiting sub.  Grabs a ladder, pulls himself up. \nThe hatch is closing...  He splashes through the water flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor shutting the hatch.

Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub. He creeps through... \nApproaches one man working some levers, smoking.  Bond holds his gun to his head. \nBOND How do you want to die?

That was his head banging. \nCHRISTMAS (stunned) James!... \nHe takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of the sub. \nINT. SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER \nA man is operating the tanks.  Through the intercom: \nRENARD (filtered) Flood tanks 4 and 5... \nThe man does as told.  When he's finished -- Bond knocks him out with the butt of his gun. \nINT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nSeveral men occupy the central control room, Renard at their centre.  Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the reactor. \nINT. OTHER END OF CONTROL ROOM - SUBMARINE - DAY \nFrom the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas, so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor because there are so many men in there. \nKeeping behind cover: \nCHRISTMAS Is there another way? \nBOND We go down to the torpedo bay. \n", "test3_id": 542}

His acting, performed just for his children, is quite magical. \nLIONEL \"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again.\" \nThe lads are enthralled.

I'm deeply shocked. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL You don't look it. \nCOSMO LANG My function requires me to appear serene. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL That may be increasingly difficult to maintain. I've been informed by no less an authority than the Prime Minister that our populace has no objection to Royal fornication, but will never tolerate adultery. \nCOSMO LANG Well, since we cannot acquire a new populace, perhaps we need a new King? \nWINSTON CHURCHILL My turn to be profoundly shocked. \nNeither look the slightest traumatized. \nCOSMO LANG Scoff, Churchill!

A fine high shot. \nLOCAL LAD (CONT'D) Nice one. \nThey go back to their game. \nBertie rings Logue's bell. A brief pause. Bertie glances nervously, hoping not to be recognized. Lionel opens the door. \nLIONEL To be honest, wasn't sure whether to expect you. \nBERTIE I wasn't sure either. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   55. \nLIONEL Something happened? \nBertie stares at his mentor.

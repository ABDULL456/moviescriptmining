{"train": "THE KING'S SPEECH \nWritten by \nDavid Seidler \nOPEN ON: \n1   INT. BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S)              1 \nA shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs - bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's \"Trumpet Volunteer\". \nA head emerges. \nWhite gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing naked wet body in white towels. \n2   INT.    DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY                        2 \nThe ritual continues with crisp military precision. \nCLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp, thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown. \nThis emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white shirt. \nTrousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet and gartered legs to be inserted. \nMirror-polished boots are laced tight. \nJacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received. \nGlistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling field of ribbons and medallions. \nEpaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted. \nPolished buttons are fastened. \nMulti-coloured collar clasped shut. \nWhite ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed and placed upon brilliantined hair. \nPAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which he's been bedecked. \nReflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3. \nBERTIE You look like a Christmas tree. \nHe smiles wanly. \n3   EXT.    INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY            3 \nTHE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill. \nLiveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess. \nBertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH - considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land, truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously, creating a happy chaos. \nElizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave. \nTwo little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and four, wave back from their nursery window. \n4   INT/EXT.    AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY                 4 \nBertie nervously lights a cigarette.    Elizabeth pats his hand. \nELIZABETH Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't rain. \nBERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators, prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs, agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of the day. \nA large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants. \nREVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back. \nThe first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Never trust the wireless. \nBertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour, which segues into a GARGLING sound. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     4. \n5   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                                5 \nA gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the control room. \nThe FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three... two... \nLIONEL (CONT'D) \"How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees?\" \nELIZABETH Pardon? \nLIONEL Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist. \nHe offers to shake hands.    She doesn't take it, even though she's gloved. \nELIZABETH (with sang froid) I'd be more comfortable in your office. \nLIONEL That's for clients. Where's Mister J? \nELIZABETH He doesn't know I'm here. \nLIONEL That's not a promising start. \nELIZABETH My husband's seen everyone. They were all useless. He's given up hope. \nLIONEL A bit premature. \nELIZABETH Because he hasn't seen you? \nLionel doesn't disgree. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) You're very sure of yourself. \nLIONEL I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured. \nELIZABETH Of course my husband wants to be cured! His position requires public speaking upon occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement may grow more frequent. \nLIONEL He should change jobs. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     8. \nELIZABETH He can't. \nLIONEL Indentured servitude? \nELIZABETH Something of that nature. \nLIONEL Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his personal history. I'll make a frank appraisal. \nELIZABETH Doctor... \nLogue tries to object but she over-rides. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) ...I do not have a \"hubby\". We never talk about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'. You must come to us. \nLIONEL Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf, by my rules. \nThe lady lifts her veil. \nELIZABETH Perhaps you'll make an exception? \nHe recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet refuses to be intimidated. \nLIONEL I thought the appointment was for \"Johnson\"? \nELIZABETH A name used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His Royal Highness was aboard. \nLIONEL I'm considered the enemy? \nELIZABETH You will be, should you continue to be un- obliging. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  9. \nLIONEL For my method to succeed there must be mutual trust, complete honesty, and total equality. That process takes place in my consultation room. No exceptions. \nELIZABETH In which case... (re-lowering her veil) I should have kept my pledge. I promised my husband I'd stop seeking \"The Great Cure.\" I've wasted your time. And mine. \nShe exits, closing the door firmly behind her. \nLIONEL Bloody hell, I buggered that. \nWACK! The sound of something solid meeting leather. \n11   EXT.    SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON              11 \nA foot kicks a ball. Lionel is returning home from work. He's a well-known fixture locally. Some lads are playing footie. One of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and entering a modest brownstone. \n12   INT.    LOGUE'S ENTRYWAY AND STAIRWELL - LATE AFTERNOON       12 \nAs Lionel mounts the stairs he's set upon by three sturdy boys - VALENTINE, IAN, and PETER - with handkerchiefs tied around the lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick swords. \nVALENTINE Stand and deliver! \nLIONEL (falling into the game) `ow dares molest...Jack The Ripper?! \nBERTIE Can I be a penguin instead? \nHe drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like a penguin. The girls giggle, but are undeterred. \nLILIBET The horsie story, please. \nBERTIE Ah well. \nCalled upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor impediment, and it fades. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Once upon a time there were two horsies. A white horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The white horse said \"neigh\". The black horse said, \"neigh\". The white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. The black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the end of the story. Now off to bed. \nAs the girls exit: \nLILIBET A silly story really. But Father tells it rather well. \nThe girls have gone. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                               13. \nBERTIE David called. He said come round to The Fort on Friday and stay for dinner. \nELIZABETH Will she be there? \nBERTIE I suppose. \nELIZABETH Seriously? \nBERTIE Seriously, she'll be there. \nELIZABETH I think I meant... is David serious? \nBERTIE About our coming? \nELIZABETH About her! \nBERTIE A married American? Twice divorced? He can't be. \nELIZABETH She can. \n15   INT. STAGE OF A LONDON THEATRE - NEW DAY                15 \nMovements behind a curtain. \nMUFFLED VOICE (UNSEEN) Now? \nFrom the auditorium: \nDIRECTOR Now! \nSomeone pushes through a gap. Its Lionel. \nLIONEL \"Now...\" \nFalters, begins again. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    14. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) \"Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York...\" \nHis elocution is crisp and flawless. His acting, however, is unconvincing. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) \"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths...\" \nDIRECTOR (interrupts crisply) Thank you. Beautiful diction...but I don't hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King. \nLionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity. \nLIONEL What do you suggest? \nDIRECTOR Continue to do whatever you do, and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction. \nCrushed, Lionel retreats behind the curtain. \n16   EXT.   BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW EVENING                         16 \nCold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights. \nOn the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers. Viewing stands are beginning to fill. \nThe King's voice is heard: \nKING GEORGE V (O.S.) Stride boldly up to the bloody thing, stare it square in the eye, and talk to it as you would to any decent Englishman. \n17   INT. THE KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - EVENING             17 \nThe King's study resembles a naval captain's cabin. Both men are uniformed for a state occasion. Bertie regards the BBC microphone as though it were an alien. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    15. \nELIZABETH You know perfectly well. \nAs they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads: PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS \"SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!\" \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Neglects to tell them what must be done, how its to be done, and who's to do it. \nBERTIE David has `the touch'. They adore him. \nAs the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's inside. Some point. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) I'll wager they're saying: There's the useless one who can't speak. \n23   INT. LOGUE'S WAITING ROOM - DAY                                23 \nBertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   19. \nELIZABETH There's no receptionist. \nElizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (loudly) The Johnsons. \nFrom the inner office. \nLIONEL (O.S.) Not finished yet. \nElizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav. \nBERTIE How'd you find this physician? \nELIZABETH (poker-faced) Classifieds; next to \"Saucy model, Shepherd's Market\". \nBertie smiles despite his mood. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Comes highly recommended. Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor. (realizes) Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?! \nBERTIE I'm not sure I want to see this fellow. \nELIZABETH I'm not sure he wants to see you. \nThe consultation room door opens and a working class young woman - ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She retreats rapidly back into the consulting room. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Perhaps this was a mistake. \nAfter an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be properly formal, and stutters: \nANNA You can go in now, \"Mr. Johnson\". \nBERTIE I'm not actually Mr ... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   20. \nANNA (whispers, terrified) I know. (then to Elizabeth) Dr Logue says... \nLIONEL (O.S.) Lionel! \nANNA Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it being a pleasant day, take a stroll. (to the consultation room) Was that alright? \nLIONEL (O.S.) Bloody marvellous. \nANNA (choking up) Thank you...Lionel. \nAnna flees quickly. \nLIONEL (O.S.) Mr. Johnson, do come in. \nThe Yorks look at each other. \n24   INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                        24 \nA totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey and smoky blue. \nBERTIE My wife's favorite colours. \nHere, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns. \nLIONEL Glad we have something in common. \nBertie's head bangs into one of the models. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) My lads build them. Make yourself comfortable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    21. \nBERTIE Please... \nLIONEL What? \nBERTIE I beg your pardon? \nLIONEL First recollection of the world? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     24. \nBERTIE (stutter growing in intensity) I'm not here to discuss personal matters. \nLIONEL Why're you here then? \nBERTIE (exploding) Because I bloody well stutter! And you bloody well can't fix it!!! \nLIONEL Temper. \nBERTIE One of my numerous faults. \nLIONEL Do you stutter when you think? \nBERTIE Don't be ridiculous. \nLIONEL One of my many faults. How about when you talk to yourself? \nBERTIE I don't talk to myself! \nLIONEL Come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, Bertie. \nBERTIE Stop calling me that! \nLIONEL Shan't call you anything else. \nBERTIE Then we shan't speak! \nSilence. The jug has boiled.    Lionel makes himself a cup of tea. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Must I pay for this? \nLIONEL Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   25. \nBERTIE Of course not! \nLIONEL Proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture. \nBERTIE When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!! \nLIONEL Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now. \nBERTIE (bitterly) Easy money. You're on. \nLIONEL See your shilling then. \nBERTIE Royals don't carry money. \nLIONEL How convenient. \nLogue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) I'll stake you. Pay me back next time. \nBERTIE If there is a next time. \nLIONEL Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on. \nDuring this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book. Bertie glares at it defiantly. \nBERTIE I certainly can't read The Bard. \nLIONEL `Easy money'. \nBertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse. \nBERTIE \"To be or not to be, That is the question. Whether it is wiser...\" There! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     26. \nReaches for the coin. \nLIONEL Not so fast. \nBERTIE I proved I can't read. \nLIONEL You proved you can't listen. \nHands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones.    Bertie doesn't want to take them. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) A princely bob is at stake. \nBertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial. LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music stops. \nDAVID She'll recover. \nBertie shoots him a look. \nBERTIE Father won't. \n28   INT./EXT. SHOOTING BREAK ON SANDRINGHAM LANE - CONTINUOUS      28 \nDavid drives.   Badly. \nDAVID He's doing this on purpose. \nBERTIE Dying?! \nDAVID Some sod tipped him off Wallis is getting a quickie divorce and we're going to make our marriage a fait accompli. As an act of pure spite, Father's trying to depart prematurely in order to complicate matters. \nThe break almost careens off the lane. \nBERTIE You believe that? \nDAVID Wallis explained it. She's terribly clever. \n29   INT.   KING'S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - DAY                       29 \nThe King is propped up in bed, wrapped in his favorite faded Tibetan dressing gown, hooked to an oxygen tank. He's surrounded by his wife, Queen Mary, his two eldest sons, his Secretary - CLIVE WIGRAM - his personal physician - DR DAWSON, and a NURSE. \nWigram presents a tray with papers and pen. \nWIGRAM The Instruments Of Succession, Your Majesty. \nThe King is so feeble he can barely make his mark. Glares at David. \nKING GEORGE V You're next? God help us. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                      30. \nHe waves them out of the room, but beckons Wigram to come close, and whispers something in his ear. \nWIGRAM At the appropriate moment, Your Majesty. \nThe King nods. \n30   INT.   DINING HALL, SANDRINGHAM - NIGHT                        30 \nClear soup is being served at the immense table.    Places set for five, but only Bertie and his mother are seated.    The clinking of silver and china. Finally: \nQUEEN MARY I want my jewelry divided equally. Elizabeth gets first choice. She's not greedy. \nBERTIE May I remind you, you're not the one who's dying, Mother. \nQUEEN MARY Where are the others? \nBERTIE Lord Wigram and Dr Dawson are making arrangements. \nQUEEN MARY What sort of arrangements? \nBERTIE They didn't say. \nQUEEN MARY And David? Fetch him. \n31   INT.   LIBRARY, SANDRINGHAM - CONTINUOUS                       31 \nDavid, hunched over a table, appears to be sobbing.     He doesn't hear Bertie's discreet knock. \nSeeing his brother crying, Bertie is deeply moved, puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. David pulls away as though touched by a leper and covers the receiver in his hand. \nDAVID I'm on with Wallis! (as though Bertie didn't exist) (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    31. \nDAVID (CONT'D) I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy. Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately. (kisses the phone) Til then, sweet love. (hangs up) Wally misses me terribly \nBERTIE Mother says you're late for supper. \nDavid glares at a clock. \nDAVID Clocks set five minutes in advance, so as not to be late. When I'm King I shall set them back! \n32   INT.   DINING HALL, SANDRINGHAM - CONTINUOUS                  32 \nBertie and David enter to find Wigram and Dawson with their mother. \nQUEEN MARY Lord Wigram has requested permission to order the coffin. \nNobody wants to take responsibility. The Queen looks to David. He nods. They're interrupted by a BUTLER. \nBULTER The Archbishop of Canterbury. \nHe notices something on his desk, the record Logue made. \nPOV: the label - His Master's Voice - stares up at him. \nHe releases his emotions in an outburst of anger. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) What's this bloody thing doing here?! \nELIZABETH Bertie... \nBERTIE The man was a total fraud! \nHe picks up the record and is about to smash it against the edge of his desk, then realizes the mess that would make and tosses it into a waste paper basket. Then changes his mind. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Would you like to hear? \nELIZABETH Not particularly. \nBERTIE Well   I think you should. You should know what   goes on. Telling me he could help me read   flawlessly. Lying bastard! Listen to this   babble! \nBertie takes the record from the trash and walks to a Victrola stand, lifts the arm, places the steel needle, expecting to hear his stuttering voice. Instead, what he hears is flawless and flowing: \nBERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE \"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: - Whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them?\" (the needle sticks) (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     35. \nBERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE (CONT'D) \"...sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? And by opposing end them? And by opposing...\" \nBertie lifts the needle. He and his wife stare at each other; there are tears in her eyes. \nThe ROAR OF A HUGE delirious crowd is heard, growing in volume. The roar becomes chillingly recognizable: \"Zeig Heil! Zeig Heil! Zeig Heil!\" \nGO TO BLACK: \nHitler, giving one of his mass rally speeches, continues. \nThe brass numbers 10 appears on the blackness.   It is: \n36   EXT.   10 DOWNING STREET - NEW NIGHT                            36 \nThe black front door of the Prime Minister's residence. The Fuhrer's tirade continues as CAMERA moves through the door into 10 Downing Street itself. \n37   INT.   10 DOWNING STREET - CONTINUOUS                           37 \nCAMERA explores the dwelling, during which Hitler grows louder and more shrill, until: \n38   INT.   BALDWIN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS                             38 \nThe glowing light of an illuminated dial of a radio, listened to by Churchill and Baldwin. They wear black armbands. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Turn that devil off! \nThe hysteria stops. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D) If only one could do that so easily in real life. \nBALDWIN Chamberlain thinks that Hitler can be reasoned with. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Neville is an old woman. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   36. \nBALDWIN That's the direction its going, Winston. You're out of step. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL We'll see who trips and falls. \nBALDWIN Enough pleasantries. I've asked you here because you seem to be the only sensible member of the King's camp. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Nice of you to say so, Stanley. \nBALDWIN Is he willing to be reasonable? \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Depends on the definition. \nBALDWIN (bluntly) Has he seen the light? \nWINSTON CHURCHILL He has. \nBaldwin brightens. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D) Our Monarch basks in the warming rays of a celestial orb. Her name is Wally. \nBaldwin's face clouds once again. \n39   INT.   LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY                  39 \nA headline screams: HITLER RATTLES SABRE. \nBERTIE What's your Myrtle got to do with me? Elizabeth doesn't much care for you either, but here I am. \nLIONEL That woman has style. \nBERTIE Which is why she dislikes you. You're far too familiar. (referring to the consultation room) May we discuss this properly? \n44   INT.   LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                 44 \nThey enter: \nLIONEL You look dreadful. \nBERTIE Another example of exactly the sort of thing you don't say to a Royal. And you're too close. \nLIONEL But you're not Royal in this room. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    40. \nBERTIE Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes you. \nHe starts to sit. \nLIONEL Not there! \nCRUNCH.   A model airplane was nestling in the armchair. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Curtis bi-plane, now a Curtis mono-wing. \nBERTIE Oh I say, I'm terribly sorry. Tell your lads I'll buy a new one. \nLionel takes out the box of model building gear the boys left. \nLIONEL You don't have any money. I'll fix it. So, Bertie, what brings you here? Your father's death? \nBertie is silent. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Mine lay rigid, fists clenched angrily at his sides, daring the Reaper: take me, you bastard! \nBERTIE What was he angry about? \nLIONEL I was a great disappointment. \nBERTIE Thought he'd be proud of you. \nLIONEL So did I. \nBERTIE A man of stature? \nLIONEL A clerk. \nBERTIE Oh. (pause) (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   41. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) I was informed, after the fact, my father's last words were: \"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.\" (pause) Couldn't say that to my face. (then) Your mother? \nLIONEL Coughed herself to death when I was young. \nBERTIE Oh. \nLIONEL I remember going to the theatre with her. Not real theatre...traveling players. \nBERTIE I've been to Australia. \nLIONEL Not where I lived. \nBERTIE (blurts) My brother. That's why I'm here. \nLIONEL What's he done? \nBERTIE Can't say. \nLIONEL I'm going home now. \nBERTIE You must undersand, I can't puh-puh-puh... \nHis jaw and throat muscles constrict. \nLIONEL Try singing it. \nBERTIE Pardon? \nLIONEL Know any songs? \nBERTIE \"Swanee River\". TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  42. \nLIONEL Very modern. \nLIONEL Now dope the other wing. Did David tease you? \nBERTIE They all did. \"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie\". Father encouraged it. \"Spit it out, boy!\" Thought it would make me stop. Is this necessary?! \nLIONEL Otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue. \nBERTIE I mean the damn questions! \nLIONEL Mandatory. Tell me more about your storybook childhood. What was your earliest memory? \nBERTIE You asked that before. \nLIONEL This time I'd like an answer. \nBERTIE Being born. \nLIONEL How can you remember that? \nBERTIE December 14th. \nLIONEL I don't understand. \nBERTIE \"Mausoleum Day\". Prince Albert departed on that date. I was named Bertie to placate Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief. (stutter growing in intensity) (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   46. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Let's stick to medical history please. I'm naturally left handed, which was considered inappropriate. \nLIONEL And? \nBERTIE I was punished. Now I'm right handed. \nLIONEL Anything else? \nBERTIE Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate. \nLionel waits. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Metal splints were made...worn night and day...very painful. Now I have straight legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it be: \"Myrtle says no?\" \nLIONEL You sound angry. \nBERTIE Yes, I told you, I have a temper. \nLIONEL Angry at me, or at your brother? \nBertie remains stubbornly silent.    Then blurts: \nBERTIE He's fallen in love! \nLIONEL How dreadful. \nBERTIE With the wrong sort of woman! \nLIONEL What's wrong with her? \nBERTIE She's American. \nLIONEL Some of them must be lovable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   47. \nBERTIE This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be happy, but the family, the Church, the nation, won't have it. \nLIONEL Can't they fornicate privately like adults? \nBERTIE If only! David used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment. But now... \nLIONEL \"Queen Wallis of Baltimore\"? \nBERTIE Please. \nLIONEL Does sound a bit iffy. \nBERTIE I made a smudge! \nLIONEL Touch it up. \nBERTIE You want me to beg for help? \nLIONEL I advise you never to beg. Especially if you might be King. \nBERTIE Don't say that! \nLIONEL I see. For reasons you cannot disclose, fearing ramifications you will not explain, you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith? You already owe me a shilling. \nBertie takes a coin out of his pocket, hesitates, then offers it to Logue. \n53   INT. LOGUE'S STUDY - NEW DAY                               53 \nBertie stands shattered, lost in his painful memory. \nBERTIE I couldn't say anything! \nLIONEL You could've refused. Don't you know any rude words? \nBERTIE What a bloody stupid question! I just said one. Bloody. Bloodybloodybloody! \nLIONEL Perhaps a touch more vulgar? \nBERTIE Certainly not. \nLIONEL To prove you know how. \nBERTIE Bugger! \nLIONEL A public school prig could do better. \nBERTIE Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard! \nLIONEL Hardly robust. \nBERTIE Shit then. Shit, shit, shit! \nLIONEL See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? You don't stutter when you swear. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                 57. \nBERTIE Because I'm angry! \nLIONEL Get angry more often. Do you know the f- word? \nBERTIE Fornication? \nLIONEL Oh Bertie... \nBERTIE Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck! \nLIONEL Bravissimo! Now a resounding chorus of... \nBERTIE Bloody, bloody. bloody! Shit, shit, shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck! \nA pounding on the wall. \nMYRTLE (O.S.) We have children...! \nBERTIE (whispers) This is your fault! \nLIONEL Sorry, pet! Won't happen again! \nMYRTLE (O.S.) I should hope not! \nBERTIE Apologies, Mrs. Logue. \nLIONEL First time I've heard you laugh. \nBERTIE Royals aren't allowed emotions in public. \nLIONEL Which explains a lot. \nBertie is in no mood to be provoked. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    58. \nBERTIE What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?! \nLIONEL Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed. \nWithout thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie supportively on the shoulder. \nBertie pulls back in offended shock.   All the warning signals instilled in him are going off. \nBERTIE Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous man, Logue. Who sent you? \nLIONEL Anyone in mind? \nBERTIE The lurking shadows. Courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased. \nLIONEL Your wife was the one who sought me out. \nBERTIE Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me! \nLIONEL But you don't share her belief? Why come here? \nBERTIE I'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue. \nLIONEL First class. \nA long pause as Myrtle digests this. \nMYRTLE What about your... \nLIONEL Willie's a problem...not much progress. The others have been referred. \nMYRTLE What'll you do when we get home? \nLIONEL Try not to act the toff. Teach perhaps. \nMYRTLE You could... \nLIONEL No! I'm not good enough! \nMYRTLE You gave it a try, Lionel. \nLIONEL Yes, I had a go. Thanks to your patience. (grief overwhelms him) I just bloody well wasn't good enough! \nMYRTLE (studying the tickets) Oh Lionel! This must've cost you. \nCHOP!   CHOP!    CHOP! The sound of an axe. \n56   EXT.    GROUNDS AND TERRACE, BALMORAL - NEW DAY                 56 \nA woodsman's axe CHOPS into the thick trunk of a massive tree. \nNearby, a bulldozer cuts into the green turf and rich soil. \nThe felling and earth removal are being watched by Churchill and Lang from a distant terrace. In the background a jazz band in white tuxedos syncopates pertly. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    63. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Five hundred year old oaks! Part of the hill! Removed to improve the view! \nCOSMO LANG How ever does she do it? \nInside the ballroom, seem through open French doors, an afternoon dance is being held. Churchill and Lang look in. \n57   INT.   BALLROOM, BALMORAL - CONTINUOUS                       57 \nAt the epicenter, a dashing couple: David, the very picture of insouciance, and clinging to his arm, dripping in jewelry, a rather small, angular, dark haired woman, with a high brow and square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical feature is her back, displayed fully by a dress that plunges to her nates. Surrounded by their entourage, they are the apex of chic. \nWatching from the sidelines: \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination? I realize of course, that may be outside your personal experience. \nWinston exchanges his empty champagne flute for a full one from the tray of a passing footman. \nCOSMO LANG You've the Devil in you today. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL If anyone should know, it would be Your Grace. \nCOSMO LANG All aspects of mankind are within my venue. Did you know, HM has trouble with his glands? \nChurchill almost chokes on his champagne. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL I'd not appreciated Your Grace was so well versed concerning things testicular! \nCOSMO LANG They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    64. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL A veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information. \nCOSMO LANG Apparently it affects the quality, although not the quantity, of HM's endeavors. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL And the brother? \nCOSMO LANG Unscathed. Two daughters. I shepherd my flock in all matters, Winston, including multiplication. \nThey make their way inside. In the distance an Austin Princess can be seen making its way up the stately tree-line avenue. \n58   INT.   AUSTIN PRINCESS, BALMORAL ESTATE - CONTINUOUS         58 \nBertie and Elizabeth are dressed for the party. \nBERTIE We must try to be pleasant. \nELIZABETH Your father not dead six months, and That Woman throws, \"A garden potty.\" P-o-t-t-y. She's sleeping in your mother's bedroom. And I know perfectly well she calls me `the Dowdy Duchess\", and \"Cookie\". \n59   INT.   BALLROOM, BALMORAL - DAY                              59 \nAt the buffet table Churchill helps himself copiously. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Has it occurred to you, as it has only occurred to me, that a Monarch with a gland problem, who realizes he cannot produce issue, might not wish to be King...? knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed. \nDAVID He's much maligned. By the Jews, according to Wallis. And she's very clever about politics. \nBERTIE The man's a monster! Our position must remain clear. \nDAVID Why's that, old chap? \nBERTIE We are a German family! \nDAVID Didn't bother anyone during WWI. And Kaiser Willie was our uncle. \nBERTIE Because we took an English name! Windsor. Because we are England. We are the heart and soul of this nation. That must never change. \nDAVID Are you already in charge? \nBERTIE I'm trying to warn you. \nDAVID Am I being threatened? \nBERTIE David, your role is to consult and to be advised. \nDAVID Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution. \nBERTIE Sounds like you haven't. \nDAVID I won't be a lackey to an unwashed politician like Stanley Baldwin! \nBERTIE He's your Prime Minister. \nDAVID And I'm his King! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   69. \nBERTIE If you refuse to listen to our Government, they have no choice but to resign. \nDAVID I'll form another. There's Winston. He'd love to be P.M. We'll create a King's Party. \nBERTIE To fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic? \nDAVID I'd risk anything and everything for Wallis. Don't I have rights? \nBERTIE Privileges. \nDAVID Not the same thing. \nBERTIE No. \nDAVID Yet an ordinary man may marry for love. \nBERTIE We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred to be profiles on a coin. If you were ordinary, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?! \nDAVID What's the point then? Just to look posh? You know...your speech is much improved tonight. Hardly a hesitation. Yearning for a larger audience, are we? \nBERTIE Don't say such a thing! \nDAVID Is my young brother trying to push me off the throne? Sounds positively medieval. \nBERTIE I beg of you, don't do this to my wife, my daughters, to me. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     70. \nDAVID The politicians will give in. See you at my Coronation...Bertie. \nThe champagne cork finally POPS. He strides off. \n61   EXT.   10 DOWNING STREET - NEW DAY                            61 \nEstablishing shot of the Prime Minister's residence. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.) Nice of you to invite me to your digs, Stanley. \n62   INT.   BALDWIN'S STUDY, 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY               62 \nBaldwin and Churchill are alone together.    No love lost between these two men. \nBALDWIN As you may have guessed... \nChurchill is silent.   Balwin waits, then: \nBALDWIN (CONT'D) ...I intend to resign. The Royal scandal has weakened my position considerably. \nChurchill, on the edge of his seat, can't suppress an anticipatory grin. Baldwin takes pleasure in deflating it. \nBALDWIN (CONT'D) No need to volunteer your services, Winston. Neville Chamberlain will take my place, once this Royal matter is settled. As Chancellor of the Exchequer he already lives next door. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL My opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough, Stanley. \nBALDWIN Will it? Well, enough chit-chat. The question of a morganatic marriage, as a possible solution, has been put to the Dominion Prime Ministers. After all, HM is their King too. \nELIZABETH A previous engagement. \nLIONEL Some other time, love. \nLogue ushers Elizabeth into the study, giving Myrtle a nervous little wave. She glares and exits. \nIN THE STUDY: \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle. \nBertie stifles a snort. Elizabeth glares at him. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) (to Elizabeth) Good of you to come. \nELIZABETH Harley Street is far too public. What is my function here? \nLIONEL For me to show you how to pitch in. \nELIZABETH Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type. \nLIONEL Piece of cake. (to Bertie) Please assume a supine position on the floor. \nELIZABETH What?! \nLIONEL Firm support is needed. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                      86. \nBertie dutifully lies on the floor. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now your stomach...deep into the diaphragm. Splendid. How do you feel? \nBERTIE Full of hot air. \nLIONEL Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker. Again... \nBertie inhales deeply. \nLIONEL (CONT'D) ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach. \nELIZABETH Good grief. \nLIONEL Gently of course. \nElizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking solicitously: \nELIZABETH Are you alright, Bertie? \nBertie nods. \nLIONEL Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm...and...up comes Princess Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff. Now comes the fun part. \nELIZABETH There's actually more? \nBertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     87. \nLIONEL You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds. There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer. \nELIZABETH Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On a public street? \nLIONEL Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech. \nELIZABETH They can also be considered quite dotty. Don't even contemplate it! \nBERTIE Sorry, dear, doctor's orders. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... (stops) She's right, those two chaps are staring at me. \nELIZABETH They're always looking at you. \nLIONEL (startled) You're followed? \nELIZABETH Royal scrutiny, Doctor, best get used to it. \nBERTIE ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... (to Elizabeth) Are you timing this? iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... ooooooooooooooooooooooooo... uuuuuuuuuuu. \n79   INT.   LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - LATER                            79 \nThe family eat in tense silence TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  88. \nVALENTINE May we be excused? \nLIONEL No. \nThe unhappy meal continues. \nPETER (mumbles) We don't want to hear you fight. \nCOSMO LANG They say he has epilepsy. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Patently erroneous. \nCOSMO LANG Fragile, prone to illness... \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Some correctness in that. \nCOSMO LANG ...and will die prematurely. They predict he'll be unable to complete the Coronation. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL What do you propose? Shorten the ceremony? Or no ceremony at all? \nCOSMO LANG My idea exactly! \nWINSTON CHURCHILL I believed so. But what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world. \nCOSMO LANG What we need, and what we'll get, may be two rather different things. Did you hear his pathetic attempt at the Accession Council? He'll never be able to speak in public. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet? Who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war? Who will address the far flung corners of the Empire, rallying all to our defense? \nCOSMO LANG Well... \nWINSTON CHURCHILL The Head of our Church? Is that what you have in mind? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   92. \nCOSMO LANG Would it be such a calamity? \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Best ask our new King. \nBertie has entered with Logue. Lang spins around. \nCOSMO LANG Your Majesty. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Excuse me, sir, duty calls. \nHe exits quickly. Cosmo continues nervously as they walk through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters. \nBERTIE Is this the scene of the crime? \nCOSMO LANG What a peculiar thing to say. \nBERTIE Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners. \nCOSMO LANG Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box. I have, however, categorically said no to the BBC's new \"radio-with-pictures\" gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms. \nBERTIE Radio with pictures?! \nCOSMO LANG It is called...\"television\". Happily, with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this \"TV\" thing has no future. We shall, however, be forced to permit cinema; the product of which I shall personally edit. \nBERTIE That'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts. \nCOSMO LANG Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet ceremony? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   93. \nBERTIE What exactly do you mean? \nCOSMO LANG Something...discreet...private. We could pre-record an edited version to be broadcast to the world. Or even find an actor with a similar voice. \nLogue has arrived and comes out of the shadows. \nLIONEL A King based upon deception? \nCosmo takes Bertie aside. \nCOSMO LANG If your gentleman from Security would give us space, we could discuss this in private. \nBERTIE You mean my bodyguard,\"Crusher?\" \nGiving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie confidentially. \nCOSMO LANG Fret not. As I assured our nation in my recent broadcast: \"When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech. But to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks.\" You see, I've paved the way. But should you wish to avoid further stress... \nLIONEL Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins? \nCOSMO LANG Pardon?! \nLIONEL If you wish to call attention to his anxiety. \nCOSMO LANG Does your bodyguard know to whom he's speaking? He certainly doesn't know his place! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   94. \nBERTIE Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist. \nCOSMO LANG Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance I would've made my own recommendation. \nBERTIE Dr. Logue is to be present at the Coronation. \n82   INT. AN OFFICE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT                    82 \nLang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone: \nCOSMO LANG I've made inquiries. \n83   INT. LOGUE DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                 83 \nLogue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him. \nMYRTLE A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm. \nLIONEL Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely. \nMYRTLE You look done in. \nLIONEL I've news for you. You're coming to the Coronation. \nMYRTLE I've news for you. I'm not! \nLIONEL You must. \nMYRTLE Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse? \nLIONEL Royal Box. You and I. \nStunned silence, then. \nMYRTLE Lionel...I'd need a new dress. \nLIONEL Rather thought you might. \nValentine calls from the next room: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     98. \nVALENTINE (O.S.) Dad! Phone! For you! \nLIONEL Won't be a sec. \nHe exits. Myrtle waits. Looks at herself, bemused, reflected in a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey. \n84   INT.   WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT                         84 \nThe last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang. He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself: \nCOSMO LANG \"The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of a King.\" \nHe exits. \nTHE CAMERA explores various elements: \nThe Throne of Edward the Confessor. \nBeneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone. \nLeaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next Coronation rehearsal. \nMajestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs. \nRows of pews, worn with centuries of use. \nGraves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen. \nThis Abbey holds the history of a nation. \nFootsteps resonate. \nLionel enters.   Trips over one of the gravestones. \nLIONEL Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...? \nLights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral. \nBERTIE This is not a rehearsal, \"Doctor\" Logue. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   99. \nLIONEL Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I wondered when that would happen. And I'd promised Myrtle a new frock. \nBERTIE (barely controlled) \"Just call me Lionel\"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve. \nLIONEL Want to hear my side of the story? \nBERTIE There isn't a \"your-side-of-the-story\". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life! \nLIONEL (softly) Wembley Stadium... \nBERTIE Because I have a right to be heard! \nLIONEL Heard as what?! \nBERTIE A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    103. \nLIONEL (quietly) Well then...you're cured. \nBERTIE Stop trying to squirm off the hook. \nLIONEL Bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. And you know it. \nBertie stares at him. \nA familiar voice is heard from the shadows. \nVOICE Your Majesty? \nThe Archbishop of Canterbury. \nCOSMO LANG You'll be relieved to learn I've found a replacement specialist. Impeccable credentials. \nThere's a long silence. \nBERTIE That won't be necessary. \nCOSMO LANG The matter's already been settled. For your own well-being. \nBERTIE What did you say? \nCOSMO LANG Your Majesty's function is to consult...and to be advised. You didn't consult, but you've just been advised. \nBERTIE Now I advise you, so listen carefully. ...in this personal matter I will make my own decision. \nCOSMO LANG May I remind you, you do not place the crown upon your own head. \nBERTIE And may I remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     104. \nCOSMO LANG This will end badly. \nLang turns on his heel. \nLionel ignores what has just happened. \nLIONEL In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. And you are King! \nThe faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard. \n85   INT. ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S SCREENING ROOM - NEW DAY      85 \nOn the screen: archive footage of the Coronation, capturing the pomp and ceremony. Cigar smoke rises up. The voices of Churchill and Lang can be heard. \nCOSMO LANG (O.S.) I was much moved \nWINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.) There were tears in my eyes too, Your Grace, particularly when I saw you and the Dean of Westminster cannoning into each other. \nCOSMO LANG (O.S.) That's been edited. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.) More tears when our new Monarch started towards his throne, only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops treading on his robe. \nCOSMO LANG (O.S.) To the world, all went splendidly. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels, bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms. \nThe footage freezes momentarily. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     105. \nCOSMO LANG (O.S.) Now, Winston, I have something which will bring tears to your eyes. \nThe archive footage continues, but it is not of the Coronation. David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany: Hitler gallantly kissing Mrs Simpson's hand while Goring and the Duke of Windsor beam; David giving the Nazi salute. FREEZE FRAME. The lights come on. For once, Churchill is speechless. \nCOSMO LANG (CONT'D) There's no doubt: David is planning a comeback. And will succeed if our King continues to falter. Though Bertie miraculously survived the Coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed. Soon he must broadcast to the world. Hitler will be listening. David will be listening. Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening. Everyone will be listening. God help us. \nBERTIE (V.O.) (stuttering very badly) \"In this grave hour... \" \n86   INT.

The Reader wishes he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth watch nervously. \nBERTIE `Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man.' \nBBC NEWS READER (placating) If you'll be so kind, to let me show you... \nBERTIE I already know. My father taught me. \nHe spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with the little finger, thumb to chin. \nThe Reader scurries off and tells the others. \nBBC NEWS READER His father taught him. I taught his father. \nBERTIE (testing the microphone) Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody bloody... \nELIZABETH Bertie, do make sure that's not switched on! \nLIONEL You're going to be splendid. And if you're not? \nBERTIE They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway. Right? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    110. \nLIONEL Bloody right. \nLang and Churchill have entered. Elizabeth forces herself to greet them graciously. \nELIZABETH Mr. Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of you to join us. \nCOSMO LANG Wouldn't miss this for the world. (to Churchill) Congratulations. Neville didn't last long, did he? Talking to Hitler. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL My tenure will be shorter, if the King fails tonight. \nBertie and Logue speak privately. \nBERTIE No matter how this turns out, I wish to thank you. For asking such dreadful questions. What can I do in recompense? \nLIONEL (lighty...yet seriously) I've always wanted to be knighted. \nBERTIE Sorry. That would raise too many questions. \nLIONEL (pause, then) Understood. \nBertie takes something from his pocket. \nBERTIE Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back. \nLIONEL Keep it for good luck. \nBERTIE No, you won this, fair and square. \nThe object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    111. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Made from the melted coin. Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend. May I call you that? \nLIONEL My greatest honour, Bertie. (then) One final question. \nBERTIE Oh dear. \nLIONEL Do you believe you're King? \nA very long pause. \nBERTIE Almost. \nThe red light on the microphone starts to blink.   Logue joins the others. \n", "test1_input": "The Archbishop and Churchill are watching the events from the shadows at one end of the balcony. \nBelow - a scramble to restore the Cross to the Crown, and replace both atop the coffin. \nCOSMO LANG Don't be disingenuous. For our late King's crown to fall from his coffin is not a fortuitous portent. What ever is going to happen next?

I'm deeply shocked. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL You don't look it. \nCOSMO LANG My function requires me to appear serene. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL That may be increasingly difficult to maintain. I've been informed by no less an authority than the Prime Minister that our populace has no objection to Royal fornication, but will never tolerate adultery. \nCOSMO LANG Well, since we cannot acquire a new populace, perhaps we need a new King? \nWINSTON CHURCHILL My turn to be profoundly shocked. \nNeither look the slightest traumatized. \nCOSMO LANG Scoff, Churchill! Go on... scoff! But you more than others know full well we'll soon be under siege from the forces of darkness. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL The winds of war...a gathering storm? \nCOSMO LANG Oh, you do have a way with words. And who would you suggest to rally the troops, the nation, the Empire, the world? \nINTERCUT to Bertie in the funeral cortege, looking frail and pale. \nCOSMO LANG (CONT'D) A man who cannot speak? In Nuremberg stadium, Herr Hitler mesmerizes millions, whilst the Duke of York cannot successfully order fish and chips.

The unwashed moralistic populace will adore that! \nCOSMO LANG The youngest, perhaps? \nINTERCUT to George, the Duke of Kent. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Now there's dimness. \nCOSMO LANG I must admit...unburdened with brain. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Thus we're left with David, the rightful heir, who speaks beautifully, even if he talks nonsense. \nBelow, the coffin is entering the Chapel. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D) Come, let us bury one king, before we attempt to bring another to his knees. \nThey exit. \n46   EXT.

CONFERENCE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS          47 \nBertie waits at a table with a group of immaculately attired courtiers and dignitaries. This is the Coronation Committee. The chair at the head of the table is empty, everyone waiting for its occupant. \nHe finally arrives. David. He gestures for Bertie to come into the corridor, but deliberately leaves the door open so the committee can hear snatches of Bertie's ensuing humiliation.

Speechifying. That's the word around Town. \nBERTIE Merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment... \nDAVID (OVER-RIDES) I'm the brother who speaks. Or do you wish to have a go? \nBERTIE Good lord no! I hope to... \nDAVID Replace me? Well...today's your chance. \nHe thrusts a document into Bertie's hands, then pokes his head into the conference room. \n", "test1_true": "BERTIE (whispers urgently) I'm not prepared! \nDAVID (whispers back) As a Boy Scout...and you are one, aren't you, very much a Boy Scout...you must always be prepared. Nice and loud, so everyone can hear. \nBertie looks at the pages, his throat constricts, his chest tightens and his hands begin to shake. \nBERTIE I...I...I thu-thu-think we should tuh-tuh- table the document. \nHe attempts to return it to David, but his brother won't accept.

See you at Balmoral this weekend, Buh-buh-Bertie. \nIn the room, they are appalled. \nBertie stands frozen and shattered. \n49   INT/EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS ON SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - NEW DAY49 \nThe lion rampant flutters on the bonnet of the Austin. Inside, Bertie, wearing a black armband, gestures for the driver to stop. Pulling his homburg over his brow, Bertie wraps his scarf around the lower portion of his face. Then catches his reflection in the rearview mirror. Tells his driver: \nBERTIE Wait down the road. \n50   EXT.   SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - CONTINUOUS                    50 \nNot wanting to draw attention to his destination, Bertie has disembarked several buildings away from Logue's address. He makes his way hurriedly. \nWACK. A soccer football hits him on the back.    He wheels around. \nThe group of local lads look at him unabashed. \nLOCAL LAD Kick it `ere, aye, Guv? \nBertie kicks it.   A fine high shot. \nLOCAL LAD (CONT'D) Nice one. \nThey go back to their game. \nBertie rings Logue's bell. A brief pause. Bertie glances nervously, hoping not to be recognized. Lionel opens the door. \nLIONEL To be honest, wasn't sure whether to expect you. \nBERTIE I wasn't sure either. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   55. \nLIONEL Something happened? \nBertie stares at his mentor. Nods. \nBERTIE (as they enter, referring to his hat and scarf) Do I look like a spy? \nLIONEL With a toothache. \nThey disappear inside. \n51   INT. STAIRWELL, LOGUE'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS                   51 \nBertie has to pick his way through discarded toys and sporting equipment, explaining to Logue: \nBERTIE I was totally unable to speak. \nLIONEL You seldom stutter with me anymore.

LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT                                  66 \nThe glow of a radio dial. Lionel and Myrtle sit in armchairs, the radio on a side-table between them. \nDAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. \nLionel gets up to turn it off as David's voice concludes: \nDAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D) We all have a new King. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all!

Someone I can talk to heart to heart. \nMYRTLE Using simple words and short sentences. I'm very ordinary. \nLIONEL That's why we're suited. I'm just an ordinary bloke. \nMYRTLE Ordinary? You're a man with wild dreams, Lionel. Mine are so very small. A job, a husband, a home. Raising our sons. That's all I ever wanted. \nLIONEL Me too. \nMYRTLE Is that why, every day, you've spent hours with a man who's about to be King? \nLIONEL That relationship is now past tense. \nMYRTLE Yet, for as long as you could, you did what you wanted. \nLIONEL I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I wanted. \nMYRTLE And failing that... \nLIONEL I certainly failed! \nMYRTLE A great healer. Always...'great'. Where does a shop girl fit in? \nLIONEL Very snugly, into my heart! Always have, always will. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   76. \nMYRTLE Trouble is, Lionel, when you say that, I still believe it. \n67   INT.   INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE - DAY                    67 \nThe Royal standard on a gleaming car's bonnet. \nBertie stands uneasily in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet as the driver opens the door. Bertie realizes its a Rolls. \nBERTIE Where's the Austin? \nDRIVER The Palace changed it, Your Highness. \nBERTIE I liked the Austin. \nDRIVER So did I, sir. \nThe two girls wave from their open playroom window, and call: \nMARGARET ROSE You look like a chicken. \nLILIBET A rooster. \nHe waves, and gets in. \n68   EXT.

PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - THAT DAY                        71 \nElizabeth is playing quietly with her daughters when the door opens and Bertie appears, still in full regalia, straight from the Accession Council. He holds his arm out, expecting them to run to him for a hug and kiss, his solace after the ordeal. They remain where they are. \nBERTIE Daddy's home. \nThey curtsy formally. \nLILIBET & MARGARET ROSE Your Majesty. \nBertie is devastated.

And... \nLIONEL And? \nBERTIE (blurts out) What's the one essential thing a King must do? He must believe he is King. How can I possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I beg you: get me through!

All he deserves. \nBERTIE What has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne? \nThey look at each other, unsure. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke. Which makes him a Lord at the very least. \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Very well, Lord E.W. it is. \nBERTIE And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons. Heading a King's Party. \nCOSMO LANG Unacceptable! \nBERTIE So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's Party? Is that acceptable? \nWINSTON CHURCHILL Certainly not. \nBERTIE But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords. \nCOSMO LANG (realizing) Oh I say... \nBERTIE The Duke of Windsor it is. Gentlemen. \nHe exits abruptly. \nChurchill and Lang gather their things stunned.

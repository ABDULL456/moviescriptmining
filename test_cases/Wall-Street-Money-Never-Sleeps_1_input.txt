BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Leverage is sexy. 
AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART As a circle forms on Sept 16th then travels down the trend line and stops. And as a circle is formed around the Sept 24th, we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
LCD reads 4:43 am. Jacob lays awake... staring at the ceiling. 
WINNIE (O.S.) I would hear him in the kitchen. Jacob turns to see she's awake. 
JACOB I'm sorry, you have an early train. I'm going to just go to the office now. She leans up. 
WINNIE He didn't want to keep my mother awake so he'd go into the kitchen and sit there. I could hear him because my room was right up the back stairs. I'd go and sit with him sometimes. We'd eat ice cream. Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I was only eight but I could tell he was worried about something and that made me worried. (softly, almost to herself) Then the market would go back up and he would sleep through the night again. 
JACOB It's not the market, Winnie. As he sits on the edge of the bed... 
JACOB (CONT'D) It's just that I haven't been able to sleep through the night since... The thought trails off... she leans up and kisses him. 
WINNIE I wish I could tell you something was going to come along that would make it better but I can't. It's just going to take time, Jacob. A lot of time. And she looks into his eyes... 
WINNIE (CONT'D) Have you been counting Fridays? He slowly nods. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) I still count Tuesdays. 
(BEAT) All seven hundred and twenty eight of them. He leans over and kisses her forehead. 
JACOB Go back to sleep. And he goes... After a beat, she sees Jacob's wallet. 
WINNIE (calling out after him) Jacob, you forgot... She jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him, but... it opens up and Winnie notices the picture inside. And she stops, staring at that picture. Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago. A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob. 
INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Jacob heads in and turns on Fox Business... 
BRIAN SULLIVAN (ON TV) It's a complete unmitigated bloodbath out there. The S&P tried to rally at about 10am but it was met with yet another brutal wave of selling and people... we're now at our lows for the day, the week, the month and the year. Jacob looks up at ticker on the wall. 
MCC $15.13 -3.40, ACN $10.10 -1.96, ISS $5.14 -1.89. 
And he stares at that ticker... at the The Locust Fund's methodical death. Suddenly... 
BRETTON WOODS (O.S.) Are you happy? He stands in the doorway holding a drink. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) We're done. And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass shatters. Jacob takes a step back. Bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to Jacob's desk and SWIPES it clean... papers flying about. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Finished... Now he picks up the chair... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Bank notices... ... throws it against the window... which cracks. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Margin calls... As he punches the monitor of Jacob's Bloomberg... 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) Redemptions... And Jacob just stands there... wide-eyed. Just looking at... 
BRETTON WOODS Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a beaten down mess of a man. 
JACOB What happened to composure, Bretton? 
BRETTON WOODS Well, I suppose it went to hell with your fucking insurance stocks. And Bretton calms down, walks to the window. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) It's not making sense to me anymore. The market always made sense to me and for the most part... I was better than it... quicker than it. 
(MORE) 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) But it's moving too fast now and it looks like the world is going to shit anyway. And he faces Jacob Moore. 
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D) If I unwind the fund now I'll still walk with six hundred million or so. And Jacob's face falls... this is news to him. 
JACOB What? 
BRETTON WOODS It's time to call it a day. Spend more time with my family. I suppose this moment comes for all of us. 
JACOB You still have six hundred million? Bretton vacantly nods. And Jacob Moore... trying his best to hide his disappointment...

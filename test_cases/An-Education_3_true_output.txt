MARJORIE Jenny used to love those books. 
DAVID Gosh. That dates me. He was writing them when I was there. 
JENNY I'd love to meet him. 
There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor. Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where, effectively, he is the one being asked. 
DAVID I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the uptake. Would Jenny like to come with me at the weekend? 
JACK Well, I don't know about this weekend. But one day, yes, thank you. 
JENNY How often do you see him? 
DAVID Oh, once every couple of years. But next time, eh? 
JENNY (disappointed) Hopefully I'll be there by then. So that won't be much use. 
JACK (dubiously) Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night? 
DAVID Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners. 
Jack chuckles knowingly. 
DAVID Clive will get her a room in college. That's easy enough. 
MARJORIE Sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up. 
JENNY Please, Daddy. It would be so helpful to know something about the place. 
JACK Would it be a bother to you, David? 
DAVID I'd be delighted. 
Jack, Marjorie and Jenny all beam. 
36   INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT                                         36 
Jenny opens the door for David. 
JENNY (sotto voce) That was scandalous. 
DAVID I told you. You owe me half-a- crown. 
He kisses her on the cheek and disappears into the night. 
37   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      37 
David and Danny are waiting for the girls to get ready. Danny is sitting sprawled in an armchair; David is pacing up and down. 
DAVID Come on! 
38   INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM. DAY                                  38 
An ornate four-poster bed occupies most of the space in the room. Helen is doing something to Jenny, but we can't see what. 
HELEN Nearly ready! 
39   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                     39 
DAVID How can they only be nearly ready? 
DANNY I wouldn't be surprised if three of them come out, you know. That's the only explanation. They're making themselves a friend. LADIES! Let's go. Please. 
40   INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM. DAY                                  40 
Jenny is wearing a floaty print dress that she has borrowed from Helen, and there are lots of other beautiful clothes strewn about the place. Jenny is sitting at the dressing table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She can't believe it. She looks in the mirror, and for a moment, she forgets to breathe. 
HELEN There. You'll do. You can keep it. I can only wear so many every day. 
Jenny emerges from her reverie. 
JENNY (thrilled) Really? Thank you. 
HELEN What about tonight? Will you be needing a nightie? Or not? 
JENNY A nightie? 
Jenny suddenly understands what Helen means.

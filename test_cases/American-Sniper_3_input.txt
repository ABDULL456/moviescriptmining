ON DANCE FLOOR 
Taya sees the nod from Biggles to Chris, we're going. She tenses up in his arms, her feet growing heavy. 
CHRIS They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. 
TAYA I'm so afraid. 
CHRIS Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan. 
He pulls her close, HIS EYES FIXED on someone else-- 
TAYA Your heart is beating out of your chest. 
CHRIS (nods, looking past her) I'm not the only one going to war. 
JEFF KYLE stands on the rail in MARINE DRESS UNIFORM. 
CAKE CUTTING - EVENING 
The boat rocks on choppy water. Taya dabs cake on Chris's nose and they kiss. THE BOOM of distant fireworks is followed by AIR-RAID SIRENS as shock & awe hit Baghdad. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
CHYRON: "OPERATION PHANTOM FURY: 2nd BATTLE OF FALLUJAH" 
MARC LEE (PRE-LAP) Welcome to Fallujah. The new wild west of the old middle east. 
44   INT. M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER, FALLUJAH - DAY        44 
SOLDIERS sit elbow to elbow. 6 SEAL SNIPERS and A SQUAD OF MARINES to watch their backs. CHRIS tucks the little blue Bible and American flag and into his webbing then removes his wedding band, hanging it from his necklace. 
MARC LEE AO2 (26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and handsome. He glows like a halo in a river full of shit. 
MARC LEE AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it. 
The rig hits a pothole and faces clench expecting an IED. 
MARC LEE You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do "overwatch" for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 
The truck battles to a stop. 
MARC LEE The city was evacuated. Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home. Move-- 
The hatch falls open-- 
45   EXT. HOSPITAL, NORTHERN BRIDGE, FALLUJAH                    45 
A gunmetal sky. The staccato pop of GUNFIRE in the distance. SNIPERS and SUPPORT cross an orchard. 
CHRIS walks upright. The Marine paired with Chris is a mouthy Arkansas boy, "WINSTON", skitters tree to tree. 
WINSTON Keep your head down, Tex. The Muj' got snipers too. 
CHRIS A sniper won't aim for your head. 
A DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex. 
WINSTON They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out-- 
46    INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX                                      46 
An open atrium eight stories tall. CHRIS and WINSTON walk past a giant pile of furniture and debris tossed down. 
WINSTON (CONT'D) --they call him "Mustafa." He was in the Olympics. 
CHRIS They got sniping in the Olympics now? 
They start up the stairs. 
46A   OMITTED                                                    46A 
47    INT. APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR                                 47 
Chris walks from APARTMENT TO APARTMENT, some vandalized, others untouched, checking sight-lines out windows. 
WINSTON (trailing Chris) What're we looking for? 
CHRIS You ever hunt? 
WINSTON I ain't that kind of red-neck. 
He unzips and peels off into the bathroom. 
WINSTON (OS) Fuck, fuck-- 
WINSTON FIRES TWO ROUNDS in the bathroom. Chris pulls a Springfield .45 as-- 
A GOAT 
Bounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors. 
RAILING 
CHRIS and WINSTON look down to the lobby, where Marines stand around the DEAD GOAT. 
CHRIS (laughing) You just got your first kill, Goat.

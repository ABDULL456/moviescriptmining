MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE 
With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs Map To The Stars Eddie. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey, Snake, man... Great shot! 
Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him by the collar, drags him off toward an exit... 
EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls Xi-Ping aside. 
CUERVO JONES That man in black. He's very dangerous. 
XI-PING One eye? 
CUERVO JONES Yes. We gotta dump him. 
XI-PING What does he want? 
CUERVO JONES (glances at the prototype) I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I do not need this. I got a war to win. 
ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM 
As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night, crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start their engines. 
Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him... 
PLISSKEN Where are they going? 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (groggy) Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you. 
Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The Stars Eddie's temple. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Bankrupt City. The Happy Kingdom. (beat) Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping. He is primetime, man - Mister Bad News. The rest of the city's joining up with 'em. (beat) You're shit outta luck, Snake. 
Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol. 
PLISSKEN Not yet. 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen... 
Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement... 
Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels, moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after them, ducking behind the row of cars... 
FORUM EXIST 
The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit... 
Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of the Caddy drifts closer, he springs... 
And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the front seat should be... 
BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM! 
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 
The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the driver and Xi-Ping instantly! 
In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the seat and grabs it. 
Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM! 
The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other. 
KAWHUMP! 
The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X- Ping flop under the monster wheels. 
Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him in total shock, but before he can speak... 
Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab Plissken... 
But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia under his arm, slides across the seat... 
... and sails out of the Cadillac...

RONNIE So basically, I'm in charge of this whole investigation. 
MARK There's no investigation. 
RONNIE Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it, but I'm gonna need a few things first. 
MARK You can't carry a gun. 
RONNIE Well, I'm gonna need a new title. Something to instill fear in the criminal mind. How about Director of Mall Intelligence? 
MARK Head of Mall Security. 
RONNIE That's perfect. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARK And it doesn't come with a raise. 
RONNIE Got it. 
MARK And the new title stays between us. 
RONNIE Understood. Thank you for this opportunity, Mark. I won't let you down. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAROLINA MALL - DAY 
Ronnie stands in front of a Cadillac with a boot on one of his tires. 
A local news camera crew comes up to Ronnie and the FEMALE REPORTER starts asking questions. 
FEMALE REPORTER Excuse me, sir, but we would like to ask you a few questions. 
RONNIE I'm sorry, but I can't answer anything. 
FEMALE REPORTER We heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women. Do you care to comment? 
RONNIE I'm not allowed to comment on that situation. 
FEMALE REPORTER So you admit there is a situation. 
RONNIE I'm trained to resist torture for up to 72 hours, you really expect me to break now? Get real, lady. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FEMALE REPORTER (to her camera crew) We're wasting our time here. Let's go find some police to interview. 
RONNIE Good luck. 
FEMALE REPORTER What's that supposed to mean? 
RONNIE It just means you won't find any police. 
FEMALE REPORTER Are you telling me the police haven't even been called! 
RONNIE (SARCASTIC) Ewww, alert the media. 
FEMALE REPORTER Jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you? 
Ronnie smiles like he knows a secret. 
FEMALE REPORTER Yeah, right. Why would they leave you in charge? 
RONNIE First of all, if there was a situation to be handled, I don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that I would be in charge. 
The Reporter waves for her crew to start filming. 
FEMALE REPORTER (setting a trap) Look, there is no way you're in charge of this investigation. 
RONNIE Well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole fucking operation. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE (CONT'D) I don't give a goddamn if you believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin' SHIT news lady. I'm the first line of defense against this pervert. As the law's right hand, I'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. I'm the defender of this war zone. Just me and my goddamn flashlight. 
Just then, SADDAMN, an angry Middle Easterner with shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him, comes running up to Ronnie. 
SADDAMN You motherfucker, you put a boot on my car! 
RONNIE (cop voice) I warned you about parking in the fire lane, Saddamn! 
SADDAMN Fuck you, Ronnie! Take that goddamn boot off of my car.

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Gobber and the recruits are seated at the top of an abandoned catapult tower, toasting campfire food around a roaring bonfire. 
GOBBER ...and with one twist he took my hand and swallowed it whole. And I saw the look on his face. (can't deny it) I was delicious. He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg. 
FISHLEGS Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon. Like if your mind was still in control of it you could have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or something. 
SNOTLOUT I swear I'm so angry right now. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot. I'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight, with my face. He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes. 
GOBBER (with a mouthful) Un-unh. It's the wings and the tails you really want. If it can't fly, it can't get away. A downed dragon is a dead dragon. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 40. ON HICCUP hiding his horrified look form the others. Gobber stands and stretches. 
GOBBER (CONT'D) Alright. I'm off to bed. You should be too. Tomorrow we get into the big boys. Slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare. (playful, taunting) But who'll win the honor of killing it? He hobbles off. The teens reflect. 
TUFFNUT (very matter of fact) It's gonna be me. 
(BEAT) It's my destiny. See? Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his arm. 
FISHLEGS 
(GASPS) Your mom let you get a tattoo? 
TUFFNUT It's not a tattoo. It's a birthmark. 
RUFFNUT Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before. 
TUFFNUT Yes it was. You've just never seen me from the left side until now. 
SNOTLOUT It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a birthmark or a today-mark? Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches him as he leaves the bonfire.

INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - MOMENTS LATER 
Hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to the drawing of Toothless. With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal stick and re-draws the missing tail. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - LATER 
CLOSE ON ... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals. They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered, and dunked in a barrel. The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a mechanical fin. 
EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DAWN 
Hiccup arrives, winded, straining under the weight of a full basket. He clicks the scale he found (like a jar top). Toothless approaches, sniffing him. 
HICCUP Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope you're hungry. Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Okay, that's disgusting. Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Uh..we've got some salmon... Toothless swallows it. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) ... some nice Icelandic cod... Swallows those too.

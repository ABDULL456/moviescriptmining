I: Never point guns at people. Extremely dangerous. Now what about this roasting dish? What are we going to cook it in? Withnail: You're the food and plummings man. I've no idea. I wish I'd found this an hour ago. I'd have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet down. 
[He pokes the chicken with the gun. It still has a few feathers.] 
Withnail: Shouldn't it be more bald than that? I: No it shouldn't. Right, we're going to have to reverse the roles. We can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the fire. 
[He tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to fit.] 
Withnail: Lets get its feet off I: No, it's going to need it's feet.

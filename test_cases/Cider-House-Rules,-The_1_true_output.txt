ROSE ROSE Not yet. What do you know about it? 
HOMER I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father? 
ROSE ROSE Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business. 
HOMER But you don't look very happy. 
ROSE ROSE *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby. 
HOMER Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you. 
She is taken back. 
HOMER What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go. 
ROSE ROSE You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*. 
She rolls over on the bed, facing away from him again. 
ROSE ROSE Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself! 
HOMER Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen... 
MR. ROSE (O.S.) (calling) Homer! Is this a workin' day or what? 
EXT. LOBSTER POUND - EVENING 
Homer and Candy are sitting at the dock. 
CANDY We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there... 
HOMER I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere... 
CANDY Well, we have to help her! 
Homer doesn't respond. 
CANDY We have to do *something*. Don't we? (beat) Homer? 
Homer looks out over the ocean; he remains unresponsive. 
EXT. CIDER HOUSE - MIDDAY 
Rose Rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when Candy arrives. 
CANDY Hi... 
ROSE ROSE Hi... 
She keeps setting the table. 
CANDY I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me. 
ROSE ROSE I don't need no more clothes, thank you. 
CANDY (softly) Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. (pause) I've been through this. 
Rose Rose looks down. 
ROSE ROSE You ain't been through what I been through, Candy. 
CANDY (doesn't get it) Yes, I *have*! 
Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand. 
CANDY Who's the father, Rose? 
Rose looks at Candy and shakes her head. 
CANDY You want to have the baby? 
Rose Rose shakes her head again, more emphatically. 
CANDY I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you... 
ROSE ROSE I can't go nowhere. 
CANDY Why? 
Rose Rose stays silent. 
CANDY Is it the father? Does he know? 
Rose Rose turns away from Candy. 
CANDY You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy? 
ROSE ROSE (almost wistfully) No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...

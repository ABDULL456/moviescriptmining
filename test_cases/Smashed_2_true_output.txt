53   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  53 
Kate walks in to her class to find -- 
TEACHERS SURPRISE! 
-- a GROUP OF TEACHERS -- including Principal Barnes and Mr. Davies -- standing in the room, which has been decked out for a -- 
-- BABY SHOWER. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I just had to tell everyone so we could celebrate. 
KATE (shock) Oh...you shouldn't have. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES You don't have to thank me -- just open your presents! 
Kate looks at her desk which is stacked with PRESENTS wrapped in pink and baby blue wrapping paper. There's also a CAKE. 
KATE Wow... 
PRINCIPAL BARNES Go ahead. 
OTHER TEACHERS `C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love what I got you! Is it a boy or a girl? 
LATER 
Kate opens a present -- a MOBILE. 
KATE (seems nauseous) Oh, it's so...nice. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES (enthusiastic) It's to hang over the crib! 
KATE Uh-huh... 
MONTAGE: Kate opens presents while the teachers CLAP. 
Eventually, Kate begins to CRY -- which everyone assumes are tears of joy. 
Principal Barnes takes a bite of cake. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES Mmmm...it's so moist. 
Kate glances at Mr. Davies, who cringes. 
54   EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  54 
Kate walks to her car. 
MR. DAVIES (O.S.) Kate! 
Kate looks back to see Mr. Davies running over -- but she doesn't reply or slow down. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Kate? 
KATE (stops) What? 
MR. DAVIES Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You have no idea how much this has been eating me up. 
Long beat. 
KATE What you said to me was really fucked up. 
MR. DAVIES I know. 
KATE What were you even thinking? 
MR. DAVIES I wasn't -- I was just...I try to be really honest. 
KATE I get that. But you can't force your "honesty" on everyone you know. 
Mr. Davies nods. He looks really embarrassed. 
KATE (CONT'D) (changing tone) I'm flattered that you have...feelings for me. I am. But I'm married. 
MR. DAVIES I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize to your husband if you want.

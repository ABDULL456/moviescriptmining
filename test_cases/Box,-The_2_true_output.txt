INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER 
An OFFICER removes a document from a PRINTER and approaches Burns's office. 
OFFICER #2 We ran those plates for you, sarge. Jim takes the document from him. It is a blow-up of a driver's license that belongs to ARLINGTON STEWARD. In the photo... his face is not injured. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Norma and Arthur are pacing around the kitchen... thinking. The PHONE rings... Norma answers it. 
NORMA Hello? 
JIM (PHONE) The car is listed to an Arlington J. Steward... do you want his address and phone number? 
NORMA Yeah. Norma begins to write them down. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Norma is dialing a number with the phone in her lap. 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) Hello? 
NORMA Hi... I'm trying to reach an Arlington Steward. 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) 
(LONG BEAT) Mrs. Lewis, I presume? Norma's eyes widen. She nods to Arthur and points to the phone. He rushes into the family room to pick up the other PHONE so he can listen in. 
NORMA Yes. 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) I assume that you pushed the button. 
NORMA Yes. 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) There is the myth of Prometheus and Pandora... Prometheus gave Pandora a box... and warned her not to open it. But she did not listen, and when Pandora opened the box... 
(MORE) 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D) she unleashed a torrent of sorrow and misery. Norma stares at Arthur... unable to speak. 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D) Your descent into oblivion has begun. The question remains... what will the cuckold of a husband do... to prevent the death of his beloved Pandora? Arthur stares at Norma... unable to speak. 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D) Because really... Mr. Lewis... do you really know your wife? 
ARTHUR Who is this? 
FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) I am the mother of Prometheus... and if you want to save yourself... I suggest that you go to the Richmond Public Library, and find the book with the following call number: F2988.34 Norma is writing the number out on a piece of paper. She disconnects. Arthur steps into the kitchen. 
ARTHUR Norma... 
NORMA Arthur... 
ARTHUR Tell me this isn't real. Tell me this isn't happening. 
NORMA This isn't real. This isn't happening. 
ARTHUR I don't think I believe you, Norma. 
EXT. STEWARD RESIDENCE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur backs his car out of the driveway and into the street. Norma rides shotgun. Walter is circling around on his bike with some friends in tow. 
NORMA We're off to run an errand. Be back in a few hours, okay? 
WALTER Okay. He watches as they drive off.

{"test1_input": "Liz... a little girl, still crying. \nFLASH FORWARD TO: \nINT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT \nLiz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs. \nThe rubber bands on her wrist vaporize. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT \nThe glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT \nIn their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on a panel. \nThey silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low rumble shakes the room. \nThrough the VIBRATING glass window they see... \nCORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE \n...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making the vision both terrifying and strangely serene. \nORDERLY Oh my -- \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM (SET)- NIGHT \nAs the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything. The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf. \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT \nThe top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window, showering glass into the streets below. \nOMIT \nINT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR \"A\" - DAY \nMyers pushes the breakfast cart. On it, three dozen pancakes and a mound of bacon and toast. \nHe opens the door to Hellboy\u00b4s den. \nINT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DAY \nInside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old man. \nHELLBOY How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here! \nBROOM That's not how she feels. She may never feel it. \nMyers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore him. \nBROOM It's her choice -- (beat) She's human -- \nHELLBOY Oh, as opposed to -- ? \nBroom grows silent. \nHellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every time he goes at the round stumps. \nHELLBOY Mmmh -- \"Pamcakes.\" We're going out -- \nMYERS Professor, that girl you were talking about -- \nHELLBOY (whirls around) Hey. You: think twice -- \nMYERS I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back. \nHELLBOY (chuckles) What landed you this job, pushing \"pamcakes\"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise? \nMyers murmurs -- \nHELLBOY What was that?? \nMYERS Hostage negotiations. \nHellboy's face lights up. \nOMIT \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY \nPart of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris. \nMyers arrives in a taxi cab. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY \n", "test1_true": "A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him. \nDOCTOR MARSH She's been like this since it happened. There were no casualties. But it's put a big dent in our Thorazine supply... (dubious look at Myers) Are you sure you want to go in? \nMyers nods, loosens his tie and enters. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - PADDED CELL - DAY \nLiz doesn't acknowledge Myers' presence. He kneels and looks up at her. \nMYERS Miss Sherman? I'm Agent Myers, FBI. \nLiz turns away. \nMYERS Miss Sherman? I'm Agent Myers, FBI. (no response) The hospital called us. They don't feel they're capable of caring for you any longer, and -- \nSilence. \nMYERS Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name -- \nLIZ (sighs) 60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED \"LIZ\". \nMYERS It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John. \nShe looks at him. He offers his hand. She looks away. \nMYERS Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks. \nLIZ Doesn't sounds like him. \nMYERS Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice. \nLiz turns to the 2-way mirror. Both their reflections are there. \nLIZ Choice, huh? That's cute. I've quit the Bureau thirteen times. I always go back. (snaps two rubber bands) Where else would I go? \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nINT. BEAM TUNNEL AREA - BENJAMIN INSTITUTE - DAY \nAn explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted walls and steel columns. \nClay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them -- MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS. \nHellboy and Abe bring up the rear. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY \nThey enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets, typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase (\"VIRILITER AGE\") encourages them to behave like men. \nQUARRY (reads a map) We're in the cellar of the Benjamin Institute. Turn-of-the-century orphanage. Closed since they moved the sewers in '51. \nAbe removes his gloves, hyperextends his palm and senses the air. Then the surface of the water. \nABE There's a pulse. And it's coming from -- \nDebris and dust seem to float from the water's surface and towards Abe's hand. \nABE there -- \nThey point their flashlights at a bulkhead. \nABE cistern on the other side. Most of the eggs are there -- \nThey move some filing cabinets and stare at a blank concrete wall. \nAGENT QUARRY No way in. \nCLAY We should go back and request permission to -- \nBAMMM!!! Hellboy's stone hand cracks the concrete. He starts pounding, again and again, like a jack hammer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. (SET/LOCATION BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY \nMakeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING. \nAt a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his own. \nHis face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw gums and taut skin. \nAs Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles blindly on the table. \nHe opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY \n", "test1_id": 2700, "test2_input": "Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench. \nNext, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking citizens. \nIlluminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, blood dripping from his forehead and nose. \nHellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps the tongue with his stone hand -- \nHELLBOY Second date. No tongue!! \n-- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are fine. \nUsing the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window. \nSammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged glass. \nSammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel. \nHellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems lost, when... \nWHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight for Sammael. \nIt splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks. \nOMIT \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SAME \nHELLBOY I hope that hurt. \nHe gives the cats to the young girl -- \nYOUNG GIRL Thank you -- \nHELLBOY My job. \nOMIT \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS (NEXT TO STATION) - SAME \nHellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the platform. \nHELLBOY (a whisper) This time. Stay dead, willya?? \nHe moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out. \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY \nUnder the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending. \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY \nBadly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not there. \nHe quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT. \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nAbe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling shower stall. Behind him, two SHAPES come to the surface. \nShaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS (NEAR THE STATION) - DAY \nHellboy's locator belt crackles to life. BLUE. \nHELLBOY Abe -- ? \nINT. BEAM-SUPPORTED UNDERGROUND TUNNEL/ STORAGE ROOM - DAY \nBack in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers spill all over. \nMOSS Jesus -- \nTheir locators light up. \nQUARRY Abe -- \nSuddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their flashlights over the columns... Nothing there. \nQUARRY Moss, what the hell was that? \nThen, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps. \nAgent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. Useless: the things plow on. \nMoss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few seconds, a green light beeps, READY. \n", "test2_true": "The men pause: silence! \nQuarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling. \nQUARRY Whatever it was -- \nBAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare: \nTWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head. \nMoss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, breaking his spine. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nHellboy enters to find Abe, bleeding but alive, leaning against the tile, blue blood all around him. Hellboy tries his walkie-talkie. Turns on his locator. It sparks. It's damaged and broken. \nHELLBOY (into his walkie-talkie) We need an ambulance. Now!! Over!! \nINT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY \nClay stumbles around, lost. He stops under a grate. \nHELLBOY'S VOICE (on the walkie-talkie) Who's there? Clay? Come in, someone. \nCLAY Clay, Code 30, this is Clay, over... \nBehind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long blade. Clay turns in time to see Kroenen coming at him. He fires. Kroenen stabs. \nTwin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils. \nINT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH - CONNECTING SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nHellboy hears the gunfire, starts running. \nINT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) \nClay falls to the floor. \nKroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest. Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet. He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor, then lies down and plays dead. \nHellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay. \nHellboy looks demolished. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. TAXI CAB (MOVING) / EXT. BPRD ADJACENT AVENUE - DAY \nAn ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She passes it to Myers: \nLIZ It feels good to be outside!! It's been so long... \nHe can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the bulletproof acrylic divider. \nMYERS Hey!! The music!! Turn down the music!! \nDRIVER Yeah, yeah, music!! \nHe merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the same volume. Myers looks back at Liz. \nShe is halfway out the window, sitting on the door. \nMYERS Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe, Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman? \nShe takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the other window, hands her the photograph. \nMYERS Nice view -- \nHe waves at her. For the first time, she smiles. \nMYERS A smile, huh? That's good. \nShe takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful. \nLIZ Don't get used to it. \nMyers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD. \nINT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - DAY \nUnconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast: a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place. \nSHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if in a trance. \nMANNING'S VOICE He'll make it -- \nHellboy turns, Manning is there: \n", "test2_id": 2701, "test3_input": "LIZ What -- ? \nMYERS That you feel that way about me. \nLIZ You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same. \nINT. TUNNEL \"C\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY \nHellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath. \nLight filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly hear Liz and Myers. \nINT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY \nLiz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel \"B\". They find themselves calf-deep in brown water. \nMyers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone. \nMYERS Watch out. It's slippery... \nHis light shorts out. She shines her light past him. \nLIZ Oh, my God... \nMyers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent eggs. \nSAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils constrict. A snarl... \nA SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself off. A THIRD ONE raise its head. \nMyers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!! \nMyers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured. \nLIZ (into the radio) Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big Red butt over here! \nSomething stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again and again. \nINT. TUNNEL \"C\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY \nHellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously. \nHELLBOY Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!! \nThe rocks below him start to crumble. \nEXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY \nIn an \"ANT FARM\" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers. \nINT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY \nDust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles. \nOne of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed. \nTwo eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two new ones. Liz sprints to safety. \nHELLBOY Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two alone. \nHellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz. \nLit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back. \nHellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. They're FIVE. \nHellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy is in trouble. \nLiz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her body. \nLIZ (at Myers) Hit me. \nMYERS What? \nLiz is desperate, crying. \nLIZ Hit me -- (beat) All of my life I've run away from it... Now I want it to happen! Do it. \nHellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers. \nMYERS I can't, I -- \nLiz slaps him. \nLIZ I know now: I love him. I've always loved him. \nA beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's. \nLIZ Go now. \n", "test3_true": "The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce. \nOn top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy. \nHELLBOY (weak) Liz... \nThe water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands. \nThe fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all. \nINT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY \nThe screen FADES TO WHITE and then... \nSilence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat. \nHellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, on her side, unconscious. \nMyers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd comedy. \nIlsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him with a hammer -- \nFADE OUT / FADE IN \nOMIT \nINT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nHellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church- like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar. \nOff to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts. \nNext to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from Lapikov. \nLiz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key. \nGRIGORY \"And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit...\" \nHellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't bend. \nGRIGORY (gestures at the stone piece) These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world. \nILSA (to Hellboy) You are the key! The right hand of doom! \nHellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS -- \nILSA (triumphant) What did you think it was made for? Open the locks. \nHellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first time. \nMYERS Don't do it!! Don't do it!! \nIlsa kicks Myers in the face. \nILSA Silence!! \nThe open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. The altar's clockworks monitors its progress. \nILSA Imagine it: An eden for you and her -- \nHELLBOY No. \nGrigory turns to Hellboy. \nGRIGORY No? (reasonable) In exchange for her life then, open the door. \nIn torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no. \nGRIGORY As you wish. \nHe leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. Then she goes limp. \nGRIGORY She's dead. \nHELLBOY Noooo! Noooo!!! \nHe struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the eclipse. \nGRIGORY Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back... (beat) Open the door and claim her. \nHis head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed. \nHe drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper. \nHELLBOY For her. \nGrigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. It lands near Myers. \nGRIGORY Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: \"The crossroads.\" (beat) And crossroads I have become. (beat) Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key. \n", "test3_id": 2702}

{"train": "\"HELLBOY\" \nby \nGuillermo del Toro \nPRODUCTION DRAFT \nOMIT \nINT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1 \nIn a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry. \nGEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his seventies. \nOLD MATLIN Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely. \nSuper: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer. \nOLD MATLIN I haven't talked about it for years, you know? (looks at the camera) Everyone called me crazy... \nMatlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives. \nOLD MATLIN But I have the negative. \nSomeone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, dramatic effect. \nTECHNICIAN'S VOICE Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape. \nOLD MATLIN It all started back in \u00b444. I was a Corps photographer aboard an allied submarine... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT \nYOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges. \n35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons. \nOLD MATLIN'S VOICE ...off the coast of Scotland. Classified mission. I was 21... \nSGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform soaked in sweat. \nOLD MATLIN'S VOICE We had an English civilian on board. Not much older than me but already an advisor to President Roosevelt. \"Paranormal\" advisor, I kid you not -- \nWhitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a small... \nINT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT \nWithin, an incongruously proper young Englishman \"reading\" an ancient set of Tarot cards. \nOLD MATLIN'S VOICE His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor -- \nWHITMAN -- Broom! Topside, now. \nTREVOR \"BROOM\" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON... \nWHITMAN The sooner we're done, the better. \nBroom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much like a carpenter's tool box. \nBROOM This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that. \nWHITMAN Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now. \nHe moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets. \nBefore exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT CARD: THE DEVIL. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nINT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT \nSuper: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND. \nIt's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short tunnel carved into the mountain. \nWhitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside Broom. \nBROOM Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word?? \nWHITMAN (impatient) What is it? \nBROOM In private, if you don't mind... \nEXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS \nGRIGORY This will guide you back to me. \nHe pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling. \nGRIGORY I grant you everlasting life, youth and the power to serve me. \nHe dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation and a ritual. \nVON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA. \nVON KRUPT It's time. \nOMIT \nEXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT \nGrigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights. \nVON KRUPT Five years of research and construction, Grigory. Five years!! \nHe strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella to shield her master from the pouring rain. \nVON KRUPT The furhrer doesn't look kindly on failure. \nGRIGORY There will be no failure, General. I promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll deliver one. \nKroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE. \nGrigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses. \nEXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT \nThe Americans fan out, unseen. \nBroom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid a German foot patrol. \nOther GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest. \nEXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT \nGrigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind him. \nGRIGORI Tonight, We will open a portal and awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven Gods of chaos. (beat) Our enemies will be destroyed. In an instant, all impurity in this world will be razed and from the ashes a new eden will arise. \nHe looks down at the machine and whispers -- \nGRIGORY Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung. \nHe flexes his fingers and in response -- \n-- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body. \nIlsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel. \nILSA More Power!! Don't let the level drop!! \nOne of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it. \nA blade of light opens in the air! \nBurning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire. \nEXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT \nThe edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light tears loose and flies in. \nEXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT \nThe six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin. \nWithin their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another... \nFleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison. \nEXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT \nGrigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, his face distorted by ecstasy and pain. \nCLICK. Someone shoots a photograph. \nEXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT \nIt's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him down and pulls out a large bayonet blade. \nWHITMAN Listen to me, you moron: you do that again, I'll carve you a new -- \nToo late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them. \nEXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT \nWHITMAN What are you two talking about?? \nMATLIN A red ape. \nBROOM It's-not-an-ape -- \nThey hear the labored breathing of a living creature. \nMATLIN It's got a big stone -- in its hand -- \nBROOM I think that is its hand. \nHissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone saint. \nWHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom stops him from firing. \nBROOM Wait -- \nIn deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna. \nBroom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED THING shrinks back. \nBroom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons around it. \nThe creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the chocolate. \nYOUNG SOLDIER Jesus! would'ya look at the size of that whammer! \nWhitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms. \nBroom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers snatch the candy. Broom smiles. \nBROOM It's a boy. Just a baby boy. \nEXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT \nThe soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, patting him gently. CLICK!!! \nOLD MATLIN'S VOICE Best photo of my career -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DARKROOM - BACK TO INTERVIEW 1 \nOLD MATLIN and no one has ever seen it. They keep saying he's not real, but I want to set the record straight before I go. \nMatlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. He smiles, full of memories. \nOLD MATLIN Here. The real picture, not the retouched one in LIFE magazine. (hands over the photograph) This is him. The very same night we found him. The night Broom gave him that name. (beat) Can I say it on TV? He called him -- \nEXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - BACK TO '44 - NIGHT \nBROOM (smiles at the creature) HELLBOY. \nInside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily. \nCUT TO: \nHELLBOY - MAIN TITLE \nMontage: Tabloid covers and news clippings screaming HELLBOY SIGHTING IN RENO!! GOVERNMENT DENIAL!!! etc. \nTV Newscasters read lurid copy. SPRINGER excerpts (fist fight included) feature the show's theme: I WAS HELLBOY'S BRIDE!! \nSome blurry, grainy footage depicts Hellboy crossing an alley. Much like Bigfoot in the woods. \nTOM MANNING (V.O.) Look at that. That's a costume. These people amaze me. \nINT. STUDIO T.V. HOST SHOW - INTERVIEW #2 - DAY \nMANNING is a balding, official-looking guy in a suit. \nMANNING With their conveniently blurry footage of their beloved \"Hellboy.\" And they claim that he works for the FBI-? \nSUPER ON TV: \nTOM MANNING, F.B.I. \nHEAD OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS. \nManning on a TV SHOW a la Regis Philbin. \nTV HOST As the head of your division, you -- You have seen dozens of pictures like this!!! \nMANNING Exactly -- so, why is it that they're all out of focus? C'mon!! God knows, people manage to get good pictures at a wedding!! \nHe shows a blurry picture. \nMANNING That's the alleged best man -- ? \nEXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY \nLeaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN. \nLeaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the door. \nBroom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street vendor. \nIn an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED, BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens. \nBROOM (seeing this) Son... \nTV HOST Mister Manning, what about the \"Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense?\" The FBI has been known to conceal -- \nTOM MANNING That word -- conceal -- \nTV HOST from the American public -- \nTOM MANNING Phil -- Phil -- hold your little green horses. Let me tell you and the American public one thing -- this \"Bureau for -- what was it? \nTV HOST Paranormal Research and -- \nTOM MANNING -- Defense, right, well -- I'm here to clear up this once and for all. (he looks at the camera) There-is-no-such-thing. \nBroom smiles. \nOMIT \nEXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY \nOn a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the rock below. \nSUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK, N.J. \nEXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY \nA dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old fashioned buzzer under a sign reading \"WASTE MANAGEMENT\" \nA crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers. \nINTERCOM VOICE Yes? \nMYERS (shivering) John Myers, F.B.I. Transfer from Quantico. \nA beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen scanner pop out. \nINTERCOM VOICE Look at the birdie, son. \nMyers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers appear. CLACK! The gate opens. \nEXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY \nThe moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance. \nINT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY \nSeated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers approaches. \nMYERS Hello, I'm -- \nLOBBY GUARD -- Late. Five minutes late. \nMYERS Yes, I -- \nLOBBY GUARD -- Section fifty-one. Step back. \nMYERS Pardon? \nLOBBY GUARD Two steps back, please. \nConfused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND HOLDING A SWORD. \nLOBBY GUARD Watch your hands and elbows. \nImmediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's on a small elevator. \nINT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY \nThe panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes on. \nINT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY \nHe's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving up and down in the distance. \nINT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK \nThe elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the floor is a huge number: 51. \nRight in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door. \nThey go through a series of pneumatic doors. \nBROOM In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born. \nWorkmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. Myers stares. \nBROOM 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies. \nMYERS 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. \nBROOM (enigmatic smile) Did he, now? \nThey reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 4 feet high. \nBROOM Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead. \nBroom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away. \nMYERS You're not coming? \nBroom signals \"no.\" \nBROOM I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud. \nThe door closes behind him. \nCLAY They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded. \nMYERS Grounded? Who's grounded? \nCLAY Okay. You saw the fish man, right? \nMyers nods. \nCLAY Well, come on in and meet the rest of the family. \nClay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open up. \nINT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT \nClay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the furniture. \nThere are Zippo's everywhere, from every era. \nOn a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD. \nCLAY (sotto voce) He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised -- \nMYERS Who?! \nClay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape. \nMyers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats playfully paws at it. \nMYERS (sotto voce) You're kidding -- \nHELLBOY Those comics -- They never got the eyes right. \nThe voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful. \nMYERS (to Clay, sotto voce) Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real -- \nCLAY (sotto voce) Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens. \nMyers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub. \nHELLBOY What's with the hair, Clay?? Finally got those implants?? \nAgent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp. \nCLAY It'll fill in. Where do you want your dinner, Red? By the couch? \nOn a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face and raven-black hair. \nHELLBOY Who's the squirt? \nCLAY Agent Myers is your new liaison. \nHELLBOY Got tired of me? \nCLAY Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field. \nBANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers jumps. \nHELLBOY I don't want him. \nCLAY Manning says I'm too soft on you -- (sotto voce, nudging Myers) The candy. Give him the candy. \nMyers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths. \nThe GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops. \nFBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed cops and securing the doors. \nTHREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, sealing off the area. \nSTONE All areas secured. \nFrom a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear. \nCLAY (into a handheld radio) Seal the doors. Red and Blue are coming in. \nThe truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing HELLBOY and ABE. \nCLAY Okay, boys, let's synch up our locators. \nAbe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking. \nOMIT \nINT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT \nAs BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase. \nCLAY (reading a report) At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead -- \nHELLBOY Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions. \nBROOM Apparently not everything was fake. \nBroom stands at the base of the marble staircase. \nHELLBOY (surprised to see him) Father...? \nMyers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze from that of the fragile old man. \nINT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT \nThey approach an oversize set of brass doors. \nAbe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids and concentrates. \nTwo agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of bullets of all colors and shapes. \nBROOM A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite. \nHELLBOY Who wards off demons. \nBROOM Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow -- \nHELLBOY Reliquary -- \nBROOM A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy. \nHellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader. \nHELLBOY Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works. \nABE (pulling his hand away) Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry. \nAbe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of ancient magic. \nHELLBOY Oh, well. Lemme go in and say \"hi\". \nAs HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow illuminates him. He steps inside. \nINT. \"MAGIK EXHIBITION\" HALL - NIGHT \nBLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen display case. \nHe moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and statues startle him. \nOn the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of uniforms and hats. \nHELLBOY (whispers into radio) Blue: It stinks in here -- Finely aged roadkill. \nThe sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to discover -- \nA huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, but the jaws are shiny with blood. \nHELLBOY Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed. (beat) Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out -- \nABE (in earphone) Red, I found something -- \nINT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT \nAbe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one of the books. \nABE There's not much here: the entity's name is Sammael, the desolate one, son of Nergal -- \nMyers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there. \nHELLBOY What do you think you're doing?? \nMyers proudly shows him the gun. \nMYERS Helping you -- I just -- \nHELLBOY No one ever helps me. It's my job. \nHe grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too much. \nHELLBOY Damn -- Okay. Here -- \nHe hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet. \nHELLBOY (throws it at Myers) -- Then load this. \nIn the packet: A SINGLE BULLET. \nHELLBOY It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin. Load it. \nKLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it. \nMyers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows like a chemical flare. \nMYERS Jeez... What the hell is that? \nHe's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, a big, black stinger is gleaming. \nHellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe grape. \nHELLBOY Lemme go ask -- \nHellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle. \nBAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- BAM!!!! \nINSIDE GUN SHOT \nThe glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards -- \nEXT. ALLEY \n-- Sammael, still in mid-air. \nIt hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!! \nWith a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles after it. \nEXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT \nOn the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP. \nHe hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him. \nMYERS Wait! No, what are you doing? \nLOADING DOCK / ALLEY \nSammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full tilt. \nA ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A few workers load pumpkin boxes in it. \nWORKER 1 What the hell is that?? \nWithout slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area. \nA small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch. \nFull of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick- or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON. \nHellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof. \n3 WORKERS (chorus) Whoa-whoa-whoa- \nHellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: CRASH!!! \nThe driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, showered by thousands of glass shards. \nMyers is a few steps behind. \nMYERS (into headset) We'll hit the street in a minute. We're heading towards civilians... \nHe squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The vendors are yelling at him. \nMYERS Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick or treat!! \nEXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nSammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re- knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A deep wound. \nSammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking THIRD RAIL a few feet away. \nSammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike. \nHELLBOY Screw you. \nHellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still. \nWreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar. \nHELLBOY I'm fireproof. (puffs smoke, kicks the body) You weren't. \nOMIT \nEXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nA huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses. \nMyers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. His radio beeps. \nHELLBOY (V.O.) Myers??? How's your arm? \nMYERS My arm is fine. Where are you?? \nMyers moves away from the POLICE OFFICERS. \nMYERS (sotto voce) Where are you??? \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) \nHellboy walks away from the smoking Sammael carcass. \nHELLBOY I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up. \nEXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - SAME \nMYERS Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you -- \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) \nHELLBOY No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break. \nMYERS (V.O.) No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are -- \nHELLBOY Myers? \nMYERS (V.O.) Yes? \nHELLBOY Goodbye. \nHe turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness of the tunnel. \nIn the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred body. \nINT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT \nAn abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. Kroenen stands next to it. \nILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's body. He cradles it like a precious stone. \nGRIGORY (smiling) Sammael has fulfilled his destiny... Die in peace and be reborn again and again... \nHe closes his fist. \nILSA Only seven more days to the eclipse, Grishka... \nRasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in fascination. \nGRIGORY The child will be there. And so will we all -- Won't we? \nBehind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL silhouettes appear. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nEXT. MACHEN LIBRARY ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nA sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside. FBI agent TOM MANNING emerges. \nINT. \"MAGIK EXHIBIT\" HALL - NIGHT \nManning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning up. The dead guards are carried out. \nMANNING Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor. \nBROOM I thought you liked being on TV. \nHELLBOY Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough -- \nBROOM Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before. \nHELLBOY How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!! \nBROOM I worry about you. \nHELLBOY Me?? C'mon -- \nBROOM Well, I won't be around forever, you know? \nHELLBOY Oh, stop that -- (grimaces in pain) Damn! Be careful, there -- \nABE Red. How long was it latched onto you? \nHELLBOY I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow! \nMYERS You want me to hold him down? \nHELLBOY (snickers) That's right, Stud, hold me down. \nABE Professor... \nBroom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the depths of the wound. \nBROOM (sharp, to Hellboy) Don't look! Turn around. \nHELLBOY Is it bad? \nBroom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS. \nHellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits it in a glass container. \nABE Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs. \nHELLBOY Didn't even buy me a drink. \nINT. MEDICAL BAY. EXAMINATION TABLE - LATER \nThe computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs. \nABE The eggs are very sensitive to heat and light. They need a humid, dark environment to breed. \nAbe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm. \nMYERS Down there. Did you ever loose track of him? \nHELLBOY Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head -- \nBroom frowns, worried. \nBROOM (to Hellboy) We can't risk it: You'll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to bottom. \nMyers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal THING wiggles. \nINT. BROOM\u00b4S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMyers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank. \nMYERS I'm in way over my head, I know that much. \nBROOM You're doing fine. \nAt the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting in the shadows near the door. \nMYERS No, I'm not. He respects Clay. Not me. I don't know why you chose me, Sir. But I'm not qualified. \nDiscouraged, Myers heads for the door. \nBROOM (very quiet) I'm dying Agent Myers. \nShocked, Myers looks over at Broom. \nBROOM And as a father, I worry about him. (directly to Myers) In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart... \nMYERS Oh, please. I'm not \"pure of heart.\" \nABE Yes, you are. \nBROOM What I ask from you is -- Have the courage to stand by his side after I'm gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be. (beat) He was born a Demon... You will help him become a man. \nOMIT \nINT. B.R.P.D. ARCHIVE / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nDozens of HELLBOY clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12, dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side. \nMyers works at a computer workstation. \nLiz... a little girl, still crying. \nFLASH FORWARD TO: \nINT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT \nLiz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs. \nThe rubber bands on her wrist vaporize. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT \nThe glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT \nIn their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on a panel. \nThey silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low rumble shakes the room. \nThrough the VIBRATING glass window they see... \nCORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE \n...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making the vision both terrifying and strangely serene. \nORDERLY Oh my -- \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM (SET)- NIGHT \nAs the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything. The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf. \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT \nThe top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window, showering glass into the streets below. \nOMIT \nINT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR \"A\" - DAY \nMyers pushes the breakfast cart. On it, three dozen pancakes and a mound of bacon and toast. \nHe opens the door to Hellboy\u00b4s den. \nINT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DAY \nInside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old man. \nHELLBOY How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here! \nBROOM That's not how she feels. She may never feel it. \nMyers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore him. \nBROOM It's her choice -- (beat) She's human -- \nHELLBOY Oh, as opposed to -- ? \nBroom grows silent. \nHellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every time he goes at the round stumps. \nHELLBOY Mmmh -- \"Pamcakes.\" We're going out -- \nMYERS Professor, that girl you were talking about -- \nHELLBOY (whirls around) Hey. You: think twice -- \nMYERS I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back. \nHELLBOY (chuckles) What landed you this job, pushing \"pamcakes\"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise? \nMyers murmurs -- \nHELLBOY What was that?? \nMYERS Hostage negotiations. \nHellboy's face lights up. \nOMIT \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY \nPart of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris. \nMyers arrives in a taxi cab. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY \nSammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench. \nNext, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking citizens. \nIlluminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, blood dripping from his forehead and nose. \nHellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps the tongue with his stone hand -- \nHELLBOY Second date. No tongue!! \n-- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are fine. \nUsing the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window. \nSammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged glass. \nSammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel. \nHellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems lost, when... \nWHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight for Sammael. \nIt splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks. \nOMIT \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SAME \nHELLBOY I hope that hurt. \nHe gives the cats to the young girl -- \nYOUNG GIRL Thank you -- \nHELLBOY My job. \nOMIT \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS (NEXT TO STATION) - SAME \nHellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the platform. \nHELLBOY (a whisper) This time. Stay dead, willya?? \nHe moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out. \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY \nUnder the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending. \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY \nBadly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not there. \nHe quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT. \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nAbe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling shower stall. Behind him, two SHAPES come to the surface. \nShaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY TRACKS (NEAR THE STATION) - DAY \nHellboy's locator belt crackles to life. BLUE. \nHELLBOY Abe -- ? \nINT. BEAM-SUPPORTED UNDERGROUND TUNNEL/ STORAGE ROOM - DAY \nBack in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers spill all over. \nMOSS Jesus -- \nTheir locators light up. \nQUARRY Abe -- \nSuddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their flashlights over the columns... Nothing there. \nQUARRY Moss, what the hell was that? \nThen, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps. \nAgent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. Useless: the things plow on. \nMoss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few seconds, a green light beeps, READY. \nMANNING But not everyone was so lucky. (beat) Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless. \nHELLBOY I knew those men better than you did -- \nMANNING Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then. \nHe turns to leave. Hellboy gets up. \nHELLBOY No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I? \nMANNING That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. (beat) You know monsters. \nHELLBOY What are you trying to say? \nMANNING In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you. \nHELLBOY (a deep sigh) I wish I could be more gracious but -- \nBAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand and raises it above his head. \nManning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous thing. \nINT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY \nA new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer stations and tactical glass boards. \nLiz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks around and sees BROOM coming down the hall. \nBROOM Welcome back. \nLIZ It's only for the weekend, Professor Broom. Then I'll be on my way -- \nBROOM (impeccable courtesy) Come and go as you please. (beat) Find your way back. We've made quite a few changes -- \nCRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs. \nNext, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed. \nMANNING (gasping) I want that thing locked up, starting now -- Now!!! You hear me??!! \nHe flees. \nLIZ (to Broom) Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home. \nMortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps through the hole in the wall. \nHELLBOY (seeing her) Liz? Liz!! \nShe spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers. \nHELLBOY You!!! You did it, buddy -- \nMyers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone now. \nHELLBOY (oblivious) Woo hoo!! \nINT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY \nA familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway. \nShe reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, then lets it snap. \nLIZ A little something I learned in therapy. I'm depressed -- (snaps a rubber band) One rubber band. I'm impatient: two rubber bands... \nHe sits by her side on the bed. \nMYERS I'll get you a fresh pack. \nINT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK \nA cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it in a brimming wastebasket. \nHe's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload of CHILI. \nMYERS Where do you -- \nHELLBOY Shh! Just a second. \nMyers sets the tray on the table. \nHELLBOY Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for \"need\" -- \nMYERS \"Need\" is a good, solid word. \nHELLBOY Nah, sounds too \"needy.\" \nMYERS Start in, you got nachos coming. \nAs he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly stops writing. \nGRIGORY If only you had him destroyed sixty years ago, none of this would come to pass. But, then, how could you have known? \nBroom is speechless. \nGRIGORY Your God chooses to remain silent. Mine lives within me. \nRasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving and twitching beneath his human skin. \nGRIGORY In the frozen waters of the Malaya Nevka, in the darkness of the void: every time I died and crossed over, a little more of the Master came back with me. He disclosed to me the child's true name... Would you like to know it?? \nBROOM I know what to call him. Nothing you can say or do will change that. I call him son. \nDiscreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the book. Kroenen settles in behind him. \nBROOM I am ready. \nGRIGORY Good. Now, I'll add two crumbs more: (Kroenen displays his knives) Grief and revenge... \nKroenen's knife goes in. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nThe pigeons flutter on the rooftop. \nThe pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side. \nKID Just go down there and tell her how you feel! (Hellboy shakes his head: no) My mom says -- \nHELLBOY It's not that easy, okay? (beat) Plus, you're nine. You're not old enough to give me advice. \nKID (shrugs) Who are those guys?? \nHellboy turns and sees -- \nTWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner. \nAgent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers, talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears. \nHELLBOY Something's wrong -- \nOMIT \nINT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAgents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through. \nINT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he respectfully steps back. \nBroom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet, a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper. \nWith tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz, then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his chest. \nHELLBOY Father -- I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. \nManning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost master. \nHELLBOY I wasn't here. You died alone -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOMIT \nEXT. BPRD BUILDING - DAY \nIt's raining like hell. \nThe PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents. \nThe hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away. \nWatching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain bounces off his wet overcoat. \nLiz observes him, worried. \nLIZ'S VOICE He hasn't spoken to anyone in three days. Not a word. He doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep... \nINT. MEDICAL BAY - DAY \nAbe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside down, solving a RUBIK'S CUBE. Liz stands by the tank. \nLIZ I've never seen him like this. Never. (beat) Should I stay? With him, I mean? \nShe smiles faintly. \nABE Listen -- I'm not much of a problem solver... (displays the cube) Three decades and I've only gotten two sides. (beat) But I know this much: if there's trouble -- all we have is each other. And I'm stuck here. (beat) So -- Take care of the big monkey for me, will you? \nGENERAL LAPIKOV It's a pleasure doing business with you. Perhaps you have other interests. \nGrigory's voice drips with serene brutality. \nGRIGORY Enjoy the bright metal you've earned. There will be no further transactions. (beat) Only closure. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE NIGHT SKY (MATTE SHOT) - NIGHT \nA massive CARGO PLANE slices the white eye of a full moon. A map details the plane's journey over the Black Sea. \nSuper: RUSSIAN AIRSPACE - BLACK SEA. \nINT. CARGO PLANE - NIGHT \nAs the plane engines DRONE, Myers supervises BPRD agents Lime and Stone, who stencil a large crate: FRAGILE! LIVE CARGO. \nHellboy and Liz stand around a brightly-lit work table. \nHellboy shows them the medieval illustration of Sammael. \nHELLBOY \"One falls, two shall arise.\" So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. \nMANNING When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. \nMANNING shows them a set of GRENADE BELTS. \nMANNING We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use... \nHELLBOY (interrupts) Those things never work. Never. \nMANNING Each of us gets a belt. \nHELLBOY (shrugs it off) I won't take 'em. They never work. \nManning looks at Hellboy, irate. \nMYERS I'll carry his -- \nHellboy wraps Broom's rosary on his wrist. \nHELLBOY Boy Scout. \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nTwo gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow-covered Soviet roads. \nSuper:  VOLOKOLAMSK FIELDS, MOSCOW. \nEXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - IN THE TRUCK CAB - DAY \nMyers and LIZ struggle with a Moscow map. \nLIZ (into a radio) Sparky to Big Red... \nPopping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the truck bed. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY \nFastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small breathing holes have been drilled in the sides. \nHELLBOY'S VOICE Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers? \nEXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK CAB- DAY \nLiz snickers. \nMYERS We're almost there. \nINT. INSIDE THE CARGO BOX - DAY \nHellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark. \nLIZ'S VOICE (on radio) We're leaving the main road, so hang on -- \nThey hit a series of bumps. The box rattles and shakes. Hellboy bangs his head. The vehicle lurches to a halt. \nHELLBOY (on the radio) This better be the place or I'll puke. \nMotors are turned off. The crate is opened. Liz peeks in. \nLIZ Come out and see. \nEXT. 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY - DAY \nAcross a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal structure. \nThey step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead. \nSomewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING. \nMANNING What's that -- \nHellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: \"IT'S SOMETHING BIG\" \nThey stare into the darkness. \nMANNING We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart -- \nHELLBOY Don't move. We -- \nMANNING -- should go back. Now! \nHELLBOY No. Don't -- \nMANNING I'm in charge. We go back! \nHellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the CORPSE with it. \nAnother door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward. \nHELLBOY Son of a -- \nWhoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under the door. \nHellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his feet. \nThe pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door -- \n-- and makes it into the hexagonal building. \nINT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY \nHellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of rusty steel blades. \nFaint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously proceed... \nINT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY \nThere. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE. \nAbove him, ropes, hooks and pulleys. \nINT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY \nManning rest his hand too close to a blade. \nMANNING Ouch!! \nINT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY \nKroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself up. \nINT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY \nHellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back into the chamber -- \n-- Kroenen is gone. \nHELLBOY (to Manning) Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach -- \nHellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab. \nINT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY \nHellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. Manning moves along behind him. \nThe record finishes playing. Silence -- \nSWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- \n-- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate blocks. \nKroenen hauls out one of his long swords. \nHELLBOY Screw that. \nHellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, smashing its lenses. \nHELLBOY You killed my father -- \nBAMMM!!!! another hit. \nKroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls off. \nLIZ What -- ? \nMYERS That you feel that way about me. \nLIZ You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same. \nINT. TUNNEL \"C\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY \nHellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath. \nLight filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly hear Liz and Myers. \nINT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY \nLiz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel \"B\". They find themselves calf-deep in brown water. \nMyers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone. \nMYERS Watch out. It's slippery... \nHis light shorts out. She shines her light past him. \nLIZ Oh, my God... \nMyers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent eggs. \nSAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils constrict. A snarl... \nA SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself off. A THIRD ONE raise its head. \nMyers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!! \nMyers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured. \nLIZ (into the radio) Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big Red butt over here! \nSomething stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again and again. \nINT. TUNNEL \"C\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY \nHellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously. \nHELLBOY Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!! \nThe rocks below him start to crumble. \nEXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY \nIn an \"ANT FARM\" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers. \nINT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY \nDust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles. \nOne of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed. \nTwo eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two new ones. Liz sprints to safety. \nHELLBOY Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two alone. \nHellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz. \nLit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back. \nHellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. They're FIVE. \nHellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy is in trouble. \nLiz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her body. \nLIZ (at Myers) Hit me. \nMYERS What? \nLiz is desperate, crying. \nLIZ Hit me -- (beat) All of my life I've run away from it... Now I want it to happen! Do it. \nHellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers. \nMYERS I can't, I -- \nLiz slaps him. \nLIZ I know now: I love him. I've always loved him. \nA beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's. \nLIZ Go now. \nHELLBOY (closing his eyes) Anung-un-Rama... \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nHellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nHellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a winter's night. \nInebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone turns black as obsidian. \nMYERS No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!! \nHELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock. \nA beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky. \nEXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT \nVisible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's more intense, with ripples and haloes. \nINT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT \nAgain, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. The ruby beam pierces the darkness. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nHellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: a burning glyph. \nMyers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his skin, but he manages to free one hand. \nEXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT \nOGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the frame. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nHellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He turns it. \nMyers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it -- \nINT. THE SKY - NIGHT \nIN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nGrigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs. \nGRIGORY The final seal. Open it! \nHellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers her full in the face. She staggers back and down. \nMYERS (to Hellboy) Remember who you are!!! \nHe throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy catches it. It smokes in his hand. \nHe tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts. \nHellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory. \nWith a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the stumps. \nHe stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn. \nThe final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken. \nIlsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended. \nGrigory crumples in agony. \nThe burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet. \nGRIGORY You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you. \nHELLBOY I can live with that. \nHe breaks Myers' chains, helps him up. \nINT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nHellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers stands by his side. \nHe kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down the steps. \nMyers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER. \nGRIGORY Child... \n", "test1_input": "The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible force. He starts floating in mid-air. \nThe blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding an imaginary doll. \nHis arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, gaining strength. \nWith a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guard's body in opposite directions. \nWith a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. Grigory looks at Ilsa. \nGRIGORY Ready the welcome, my love -- \nIlsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto the floor. \nGRIGORY Salt. Gathered from the tears of a thousand martyrs. Restraining the essence of Sammael, the hell hound, the seed of destruction. \nGrigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle. \nThen, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL. \nIt roars!!! \nCUT TO: \nOMIT \nINT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT \nAbe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions for the others to stay back. \nHe extends his open palm and \"feels\" the air near the old man's back. \nABE Professor..? You -- are very sick -- \nBROOM I don't want Hellboy to know -- \nBroom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away. \nBROOM Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world. And they are back -- in my lifetime, they are back. To finish the job. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT \nA small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music on picnic tables. \nOn a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack. \nBehind the bench, HELLBOY smiles. \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nDry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a... \n...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden surrounds the building. \nWatching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER. \nINT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nDOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line patients, distributing pills. \nBehind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands circle her wrist. \nNear a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something. \nDOWN'S PATIENT (pointing) There's a big red guy down there! \nDOCTOR MARSH (readying more pills) That's fine, darling, Santa's not here for another month. \nDOWN'S PATIENT Not Santa. Big and red. With gold eyes. And he has beer! \nHearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below seems empty. \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT \nLiz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it... \nLIZ Back so soon? \nVisible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack. \nHELLBOY Uh, I brought beer. \nLiz shoots a Polaroid. \nLIZ To wash down my lithium pills? (beat) I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm still a patient. \nShyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm. \n", "test1_true": "HELLBOY Just a scratch. (shrug) I wanted to see you. \nLiz sighs. \nEXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT \nHellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz. \nHELLBOY We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me -- (Liz smiles) Come back, Liz. Come back. I -- \nLIZ No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it. \nAround her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at the pale flame. \nLIZ I'm learning where it comes from. (beat) And for once in my life I'm not afraid. \nShe clenches her fist and puts the flame out. \nLIZ Looks like your ride is here. \nThe garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the vehicles. \nHELLBOY The Nanny Squad. \nANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS \nClay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns to Broom: \nMYERS Sir, may I go first?? \nCLAY (to Broom) Not so fast. He barely knows him -- \nBROOM (cuts him off) Then he should make it his business to change that. \nANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS \nLiz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder. \nLIZ Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out here. If you truly care about me, don't come back anymore. \nHellboy smiles sadly. She walks away. \nHELLBOY Goodnight, then. \nLIZ Goodnight. \nShe doesn't turn back. \nHELLBOY Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do -- \nFeeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his feet, a pool of his own blood. \nHe sees Myers tentatively approaching. \nHELLBOY What took you so long? \nMYERS C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up. \nHELLBOY What are you, a Boy Scout? \nMYERS No. I never was. \nHELLBOY (weak) Could've fooled me. Go away. \nHellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. Help him up. \nCLAY C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there. \nHELLBOY This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me? (points at the doorway) Her. \nLiz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. A few of the agents help him to the vehicles. \nMyers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes inside. \nOMIT \nINT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY \"A\" - NIGHT \nIn the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him. \nAbe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm. \nABE You were burned by some organic acid. \nHELLBOY I'm lucky that way. \nUsing a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a GRUNT. \nBROOM Son. About Rasputin -- \n", "test2_input": "The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack. \nHELLBOY Are you coming or not? \nClay smiles uncertainly back. Hellboy moves in. \nCLAY (to Quarry and Moss) You two, check this dump, then join us -- \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nA large oval room of rusting metal, with pipes spilling water through a large GRATE on the floor. \nAbe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out. \nABE I'm glad I'm not human. This place would be an embarrassment. \nBelow, a vast cistern. Abe drops in two CHEMICAL FLARES. \nINT. UNDERWATER - CHAMBER (SET TANK) - DAY \nThe flares sink, illuminating floating office furniture and torn paper... \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION: R. WAREHOUSE CELLAR) \nIn the lower depths, they pass shadowy industrial ruins. Settling on the bottom they reveal the hulk of a waiting SAMMAEL. \nOMIT \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nAbe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices synchronize. \nHellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone. \nHELLBOY There you go, Doctor. This should cover your tailfin -- On loan from the Vatican, a bone from Saint Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky. \nAbe ties the reliquary around his hand. \nABE Remind me why I keep doing this. \nHELLBOY Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind. \nABE Oh, right -- \nAs transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives. \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY \nUnderwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel. \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY \nWaiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans from the past. \nSome of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866. \nClay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a hand mirror. \nCLAY See? It's thicker. Isn't it? It's not that doll-hair thing -- \nSuddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer caught in headlights. \nHELLBOY Son of a -- ! \nThe figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand. \nCLAY Red, wait! \nClay tries his radio. Static. \nCLAY Red's on the move!! I'll cover him!! \nHe pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy. \nINT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY \nClay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth. \nCLAY Damn it, Red. \nINT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY \nAbe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent egg! \nSuddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing. \nHe places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one. \nSome of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines. \n", "test2_true": "on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up -- \n-- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!! \nThe monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure. \nSammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to reach deeper, screaming in rage. \nAbe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles. \nINT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY \nThe bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND SAMMAEL. \nINT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY \nHellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs the air, then steps through a non-descript portal. \nINT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY \nHellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens of old photos of children. \nHe discovers the Sammael engraving. \nHELLBOY \"Sammael: seed of destruction. Death becomes the fertile ground.\" \nSuddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam. \nHELLBOY (turning) Didn't I kill you already? \nSammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service shaft... \n...and it's a long way down. \nWhen Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side. \nOMIT \nINT. SERVICE SHAFT (NEW LOCATION SET) - DAY \nThey crash through pipes, wiring and ducts and slide off down a duct and into -- \nINT. SERVICE SHAFT 2 (SET) - SAME \nanother passage. There they bounce off of dripping water pipes and jutting steel I beams, until they finally break through a mesh/insulation ceiling and directly onto -- \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY \nA subway platform. Full of people. \nThe two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change. \nThe dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform floor. \nSammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of turnstiles, uprooting them all. \nSammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS from the fleeing public. \nA mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant. \nSammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars -- \nThen, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's stone hand emerges, triumphant. \nHELLBOY Hey, Chunk-face! \nHe climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls. \nHELLBOY You can do better than that. Big monster like you. \nHellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael again and again. \nHELLBOY See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit people! \nSammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds itself in the tile wall. \nSammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut. \nHellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, scraping a jagged line with his stone hand. \nHe slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a wooden bench, breaking it in two. \nSammael climbs up into the mezzanine. \nHellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS abandoned on a bench. \nYOUND GIRL My kittens!! My kittens!!! \nHELLBOY Aw, crap. \n", "test3_input": "MYERS I admire him. He's a force of nature. \nLIZ He's just pushy. \nMYERS No... He's determined. Unstoppable -- \nLIZ Cocky. \nMYERS Strong. \nLIZ A brute. \nMYERS My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects. \nLiz half-smiles, sips her coffee. \nMYERS He -- loves you. \nLIZ I know. \nMYERS What about you? \nLIZ Don't know. Really. I grew up with him. (beat) I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here -- \nAs they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof tops. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nHellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at Myers and Liz -- \nMyers offers her cream and sugar. \nHELLBOY No cream and sugar, moron. She takes it black. \nShe takes the coffee, waves off the half and half. \nHELLBOY Toldya. \nTrying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz gestures vigorously. His smile fades. \nEXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT \nMYERS It's freezing, isn't it? \nLIZ Coffee's warming me up. \nBy now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park near a train track. \nMYERS What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey, entertainment capital of the world. \nShe cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down. \nLIZ You offered me a cup of coffee. I've got one, so just sit down. \nMyers is falling for her. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT \nHellboy leaps off a building. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nTwo red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing, Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds. \nHELLBOY Hi... \nThe kid stares at him. \nKID You're Hellboy. \nHELLBOY Shh. I'm... on a mission. \nHe watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench. \nHELLBOY Don't tell anyone, huh? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT \nBroom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his head. \nLIME Should we send out some scouts? \nBroom motions for him to stop. It's useless, \nBROOM No. Enough. He will never change -- always a child. Always. \nINT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He flexes the shiny fingers. \nKroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him: Grigory. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nThe pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses of milk and a plate of cookies. \nKID My Mom baked 'em. \nHe sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting and laughing. \nHELLBOY That's it: she's laughing. I'm done. \nHellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them down. \nKID They don't look like spies. \nHELLBOY Come on! Look at him, those shifty eyes, that -- phony grin...!! (seeing the last cookie) You gonna eat that? \nBelow, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead. \nHELLBOY Oh, the yawning trick. That's so 1950's! Watch his arm -- \nHe looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it. \nEXT. NEWARK N.J. STREET - LIZ AND MYERS - NIGHT \nMYERS We all have a side that we try to hide... \nMyers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back. Something hits him in the head. \nMYERS Hey! What the hell? \nHe gets up, annoyed. No one in sight. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nHellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid \"gives him five\". \nINT. BROOM\u00b4S OFFICE - NIGHT \nKroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a MICRO-SCANNER. Broom watches as computer enhancement fills out a couple of missing areas. \nCyrillic letters are now legible. \nBROOM (pensive) SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16... Moscow. \nBroom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an Orthodox priest's black cassock. \nHe pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: \"His mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16\". \nBROOM It's Rasputin's mausoleum. \nTCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken. \nBROOM I see the puppet. But -- where is... the puppet master? \nIn the dark, a voice hisses -- \nGRIGORY Very good, Professor Broom. \nBroom turns. Grigory steps from the shadows. \nBROOM It was you: The scraps of paper, Liz's sudden relapse and return... \nGRIGORI (nods) Bread crumbs on the trail. Like in a fable. They both distract him and guide him exactly where I need him. \nBROOM Moscow. \nGRIGORY His destiny. \nHe touches Broom's forehead, lightly -- \nGRIGORY You raised the child. Nurtured him. So, In return... Would you permit me? A brief, brief glimpse? Of the future -- \nFLASH!! \nA nightmarish tableau... \nEXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK \nThe ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against the blood-red sky. \nDominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly fire. \nINT. BROOM\u00b4S OFFICE - NIGHT \nStartled, Broom snaps out of it -- \n"}

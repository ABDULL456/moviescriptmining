Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape. 
ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING 
Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight. 
ANGLE - THE VANITY 
as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white makeup and smears it on. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder. 
ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE 
Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning. 
ANGLE - ERIC WALKING 
A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its wake and crosses over to -- 
MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY 
waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence, in the distance, the church looms. 
ANGLE - ERIC 
He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch. 
CREATURE KID Trick or treat! 
Eric smiles.  Not tonight. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down. He holds for a moment then moves on. 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow flaps past, leading him. 
NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between Eric and the huge double doors. 
Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy extends a skeletal hand.  STOP. 
SKULL COWBOY Stop screwing around. 
TIGHT ON ERIC 
Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me? 
SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D) Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again. 
ERIC Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die. (beat) I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included. 
STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY 
Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them. 
SKULL COWBOY Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return. (beat) No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing. 
ERIC Fine with me. 
He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast. 
SKULL COWBOY You'll be alone. 
ERIC I'm already alone. 
INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT 
Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's arrival.  He speaks into a headset. 
GRANGE We've got company. 
LAO (O.S./FILTERED) Is he inside? 
GRANGE'S POV - ERIC 
Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie. 
RESUME GRANGE 
As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle. 
GRANGE He's just out front talking to himself.  You tell me.

EXT. THE GHOST 
Heads into the beacon light. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces. 
DEAKINS Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the chin with the fire extinguisher. 
HALE His head snaps back as Deakins pulls. 
HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened. 
EXT. ABOVE GHOST 
The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind. 
HALE'S POV As he rockets up out of the cockpit. 
HALE When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on. 
EXT. ON THE GROUND 
Terry, on the radio with Clyde. 
TERRY Somebody ejected! 
INT. COCKPIT 
Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down -- is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and punches them. 
INT. BOMB BAYS 
The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING mission mode button and the cockpit lights up. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at a screen, puzzled. 
WILKINS They're not due for another halfhour. 
INT. GHOST COCKPIT 
Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject. 
DEAKINS (into helmet mike) This is Deakins! Hale lost it! I have to punch out! Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
CU RADAR SCREEN The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus of "What the hell?" and "Jesus." 
WILKINS That's not good. 
EXT. MCMURRAN RUNWAY 
Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is... 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES 40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look. Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into... 
THE HELICOPTER And it lifts up and flies off. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS

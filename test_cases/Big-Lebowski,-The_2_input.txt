DONNY Are these the Nazis, Walter? 
Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three men: 
WALTER They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of. 
The Germans stop conferring. 
DIETER Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up. 
KIEFFER Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee sreaten you. 
He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the firelight. 
WALTER Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you. 
DUDE Hey, cool it Walter. 
Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans: 
WALTER There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules. 
DIETER Zere ARE no ROOLZ! 
WALTER NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES-- 
KIEFFER His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She sought we'd be getting million dollars!  Iss not fair!

DUDE Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him. 
WALTER AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK! 
The Germans confer again, in German. 
Donny is visibly frightened. 
DONNY Are they gonna hurt us, Walter? 
WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE: 
WALTER They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards. 
THE CONFERENCE ENDS: 
DIETER Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen. 
WALTER Fuck you. 
The Dude is digging into his pocket. 
DUDE Come on, Walter, we're ending this thing cheap. 
Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's. 
WALTER What's mine is mine. 
DUDE Come on, Walter!. 
Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet: 
DUDE Four dollars here! 
He inspects the change in his palm. 
DUDE Almost five! 
DONNY (tremulously) I got eighteen dollars, Dude. 
WALTER (grimly) What's mine is mine. 
With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber. 
DIETER VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY! 
WALTER (coolly) Come and get it. 
DIETER VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! 
WALTER Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist. 
DIETER I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU! 
WALTER Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman. 
In a rage, Dieter charges. 
DIETER I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

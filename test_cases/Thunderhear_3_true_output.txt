EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out. In the dark we cannot latch onto features. 
Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as -- 
Ray leaps out, M-16 in hand. 
RAY FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop it, drop it! 
Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the Indian's back. The Indian drops what he's holding. And turns around. It's not a he. We've seen her before. At the Powwow. Maggie Eagle Bear. Her hair is pulled back tight, braided. 
Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still cautious 
RAY Turn around, put your hands on the roof of the truck. 
She does what he tells her. As Ray moves in on her, he notices an INDIAN CHILD sitting in the passenger seat, looking out into the highbeams, frightened. 
Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed, pats down her boots. 
MAGGIE You're the Indian FBI. 
RAY That's right. Turn around. 
Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye. He looks self- conscious in the cowboy hat. 
MAGGIE The people are glad they sent you. They usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop it, Motherfucker", stick a gun in your face, frisk ya down. Even if ya got a child with ya. No, it's good to have ya. It's gonna be was-te times on the res. 
Ray is looking down at what she dropped. A bundle lying in the grass. He bends down, starts to untie it. 
MAGGIE I was gonna warn ya about messin' with somebody's medicine bundle but I forgot you know all about that stuff. 
IN THE BUNDLE -- an eagle skull, tobacco strings, sage, sweet grass, and several white eagle feathers. 
RAY This Jimmy's? 
MAGGIE You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine. 
RAY Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes? 
MAGGIE Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this? 
RAY He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he? 
MAGGIE -- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him. 
RAY Who did? 
MAGGIE You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here? 
RAY A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine. 
MAGGIE Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again. 
Ray doesn't have a clue as to what this radical bullshit is about. 
RAY Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world. 
MAGGIE I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray. 
If this information doesn't throw Ray, the use of his first name does. 
MAGGIE Are you gonna keep that medicine bundle or are you gonna respect its power? 
Ray is holding the medicine bundle. He deliberates, then hands it over. She takes it with careful hands, casting a somewhat surprised look up at him. 
MAGGIE Thank you. 
RAY When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay? 
Maggie gets in the truck, starts it up. She looks out at him, studying him. Trying to figure him out. HEADLIGHTS are coming fast from down the main road. 
MAGGIE Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is. 
RAY Move it, Magdelana. 
Maggie drives forward, turning down another little wagon road, and bumping into the black night only moments before, Cooch's Le Baron pulls in. 
SA Miles and Sherman's vehicle pull in behind it. The regional feds fall in behind Cooch, everyone, packing rifles. 
COOCH Ray, you alright? 
Ray turns, nodding. An FBI van pulls in from the other direction and FOUR AGENTS empty out, wearing FBI windbreakers and heavily-armed.

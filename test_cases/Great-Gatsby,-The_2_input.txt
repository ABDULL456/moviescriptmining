TOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... 
DAISY'S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. 
TOM (O.C.) (CONT'D) I'd like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I'll make a point of finding out. 
As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby's "guards." 
CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby's gate, GATSBY'S COAT OF ARMS READS: "Ad Finem Fidelis" ("Faithful to the End"). 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... 
Nick descends the stairs, drunk. 
NICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... 
Gatsby is not amused. 
GATSBY She didn't like it. 
NICK Of course she did. 
GATSBY No, she didn't like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It's hard to make her understand. 
NICK You mean about the party? 
GATSBY The party!? I couldn't care less about the parties! You see... (SHOCKING INTENSITY) (MORE) 
GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. 
NICK What...? 
GATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents' house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we'll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. 
NICK I wouldn't ask too much of her... 
GATSBY Ask too much? 
NICK No. 
Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. 
GATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- 
NICK Jay... You can't repeat the past. 
Gatsby wheels around... 
GATSBY Can't repeat the past? 
NICK No. 
GATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You'll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything's been so... so confused since then... 
Gatsby looks out to the green light. 
NICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... 
GATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. 
NICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... 
IN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY'S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
I/E. DAISY'S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT 
PUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping... 
NICK (V.O.) Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy's house by colossal accident. 
Amidst the many revellers, DISCOVER: Daisy, hurrying through the crowd. 
GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I'd never been in such a beautiful house before... 
Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... 
At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer's uniform. 
NICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. 
Daisy's Mother stops her on the steps. 
DAISY MOM Daisy, don't scamper. (WHISPERS) There's so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family's... 
CLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... 
GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. 
Against his better judgement he follows Daisy up... 
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT 
Checking to make sure no one has seen, Daisy slips quietly through a set of doors, into the conservatory... Gatsby is not far behind... A secret rendezvous. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
GATSBY I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her...

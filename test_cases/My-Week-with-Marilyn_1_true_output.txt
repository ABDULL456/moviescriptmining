BOOTH. DAY. COLIN pushes open the door to the projection booth. The screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in The Prince And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a toast to the American President. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 68. 
OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly. 
VIVIEN I didn't think she would be so beautiful. She... shines on that screen. 
OLIVIER You shouldn't upset yourself. You are ten times the actress she will ever be. 
VIVIEN If you could see yourself. The way you watch her... 
OLIVIER There's never been anything between Marilyn and me. She laughs hysterically. 
VIVIEN Only because she didn't want you. 
OLIVIER You're imagining things. 
VIVIEN Do you think I'm a fool? You didn't think the little tart could resist the great Laurence Olivier. She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred seething in her expression. VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But she saw through you, didn't she darling? Take away the actor and what's left of the man? You can't even play the husband properly without a script. (slaps him hard across the face. ) I hope she makes your life hell! 
OLIVIER Vivien..! She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters. OLIVIER looks at COLIN in muted apology. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 69. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) She hasn't been well. There was a baby... she... we... lost it... COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) (After a pause) Do you have a cigarette, Colin? COLIN hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers". OLIVIER grimaces wryly. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Not one of those awful things. COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales deeply. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Vivien's right... I did think I would fall shatteringly in love with Marilyn. What a joke. He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Remember, boy, when it comes to women you are never too old for humiliation. 
CUT TO: 
95 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 95 
The set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again there is no sign of Marilyn. The actors, RICHARD WATTIS and PAUL HARDWICK amongst them, sit apathetically in full costume, while ORTON stands with his arms folded. Technicians chat or sit idly. As COLIN watches, OLIVIER looks across at MILTON who shrugs hopelessly. 
CUT TO: 
96 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING 96 
ROOM/PARKSIDE. DAY. COLIN pours whisky for OLIVIER. MILTON comes in. 
MILTON Marilyn won't shoot today. She's gone back to Parkside. She's upset about Arthur leaving England. 
OLIVIER He's only going to visit his children. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 70. 
MILTON You don't leave Marilyn alone. She can't handle it. She thinks everyone's going to abandon her. The phone rings. OLIVIER picks with a sudden burst of optimism. 
OLIVIER Perhaps she's come back. (Into the phone) Yes? 
ROGER 
(OFF) Sir Laurence? It's Roger. 
OLIVIER Oh, Roger. What's up? 
ROGER 
(OFF) Is Colin there, Sir? He frowns and looks at COLIN in bewilderment. 
OLIVIER Yes, he's here. (Pause) It's for you. Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him. 
COLIN Roger? CUT TO PARKSIDE, where, to Colin's astonishment MARILYN comes on the line (Roger is not in shot). 
MARILYN 
(ON PHONE) Colin, why don't you drop by here on your way home? CUT BACK TO PINEWOOD - MILTON recognises Marilyn's voice instantly. 
MILTON What the heck? 
OLIVIER Why is Marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant? COLIN looks around helplessly. 
COLIN Yes, I'm sure I can do that. CUT TO PARKSIDE. MARILYN smiles. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 70A. 
MARILYN 
(ON PHONE) Good. Don't tell anyone though. She hangs up. CUT TO PINEWOOD: COLIN replaces the phone in its cradle. MILTON and OLIVIER stare at him.

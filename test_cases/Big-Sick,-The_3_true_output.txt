KUMAIL These cookies are really good. 
NAVEED They're biscuits! Listen to yourself. You hardly sound Pakistani. "Cookies"? You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus. You're such a burger. 
KUMAIL I'm not a burger. 
NAVEED Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger. 
KUMAIL I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually a British term. 
NAVEED Well thank you for that information that no one gives a shit about and you should listen to mom and grow a beard. 
KUMAIL It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's all patchy. 
NAVEED Try being a man and conditioning like I do. 
KUMAIL What's the whole thing with Muslims growing beards anyway? It's such an arbitrary thing. Like who decided that? Oh, we have to have beards. 
NAVEED Yeah. There are a billion of us and you are the only one with the truth. Is that right? The sun is just shining down on you right now. It's just parting like "ahh". 
KUMAIL You know, I have to tell you something, Bhai. 
NAVEED Here we go. Yeah? 
KUMAIL I've been dating this girl. 
NAVEED Acha. 
KUMAIL 
She's white. 
NAVEED I thought you were going to say you were involved in a hit and run or you got caught forging some checks. But a WHITE GIRL? Such a cliche. 
A white family stares in their direction. 
KUMAIL It's okay! We hate terrorists! 
NAVEED Listen. I understand. You're in America. You wanna mow a few lawns and see what it's like. But eventually you have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I hung out with other girls. But then I married Fatima. We hardly spoke two words to each other the first few months! But now, Kumi, she's like my best friend. You have to break up with her immediately. 
KUMAIL If I find someone who's as good for me as Fatima is for you, Mom would understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't love me less? 
NAVEED She would definitely love you less. Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the word when guys stop returning girls' calls? 
KUMAIL Ghosting? 
NAVEED Yes. (dead serious) You have to end it now or Mom will fucking ghost you. 
Naveed gets up. 
NAVEED (CONT'D) Now come on. 
He exits, leaving Kumail alone at the table. 
INT. GRAD PARTY - LATER 
Kumail and Emily are sipping wine out of plastic cups. 
EMILY I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd say it's very fruit forward. 
KUMAIL Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice that's gone bad. How do you know so much about wine? 
EMILY Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my first marriage and I drank a lot and one way to cover drinking is to know a lot about wine. 
KUMAIL I'm sorry wait, what did you say? 
EMILY That knowing a lot about wine sort of covers for drinking a lot. 
KUMAIL No, the huge piece of information you're trying to blow right past. 
EMILY Yeah. I was married. 
KUMAIL You were married? 
EMILY I was. I was married. Do you want to talk about something else? 
KUMAIL Yeah, cause I don't really have any questions other than...when did you get married? When did you get divorced? What's his name? How tall is he? Did you love him? I guess I have a couple of questions. 
EMILY Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in college. Everyone I knew was getting married super young, so we did. And one day I was at a restaurant and I saw this couple making out and I thought "I don't think about my husband like that, but I guess that's okay" and then another part of my brain was like "NO IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE". I feel like this is freaking you out. Does this freak you out?

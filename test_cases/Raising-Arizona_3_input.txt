HIGH ANGLE CELL 
Looking down from the ceiling. In the foreground, lying on the top bunk, hands clasped behind his head as he stares off into space is MOSES. Moses is a gnarled, elderly black con with wire-rimmed spectacles. On the lower bunk, also with hands clasped behind his head and staring off at the same spot in space, is Hi. 
VOICE OVER I tried to sort through what the Doc had said, but prison ain't the easiest place to think. 
MOSES An' when they was no meat we ate fowl. An' when they was no fowl we ate crawdad. An' when they was no crawdad to be foun', we ate San'. 
HI You ate what? 
MOSES (nodding) We ate San'. 
HI You ate sand?! 
MOSES Dass right... 
PAROLE BOARD ROOM 
Hi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. 
CHAIRMAN Well Boy, you done served your twenty munce, and seeing as you never use live ammo, we got no choice but to return you to society. 
SECOND MAN These doors goan swing wide. 
HI I didn't want to hurt anyone, Sir. 
SECOND MAN Hi, we respect that. 
CHAIRMAN But you're just hurtin' yourself with this rambunctious behavior. 
HI I know that, sir. 
CHAIRMAN Okay then. 
HIGH SHOT 
Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling. 
VOICE OVER Now I don't know how you come down on the incarceration question... 
Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. 
VOICE OVER ...whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge. 
He spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the back door. Locked. 
VOICE OVER ...But I was beginning to think... 
As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. 
VOICE OVER ...that revenge is the only argument makes any sense. 
FLASH 
On Hi against the mug-shot wall. 
ED Turn to the right! 
SHERIFF (O.S.) Don't forget his latents, Ed! 
CLOSE ON HI'S HAND 
We see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet. 
HI (O.S.) Hear about the paddy-wagon collided with the segment mixer, Ed? Twelve hardened criminals escaped. 
Ed's hand lingers on top of his.  Hi's other hand enters to rest on top of hers. 
HI (O.S.) Got a new beau? 
ED (O.S.) No, Hi, I sure don't. 
Hi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's. 
HI (O.S.) Don't worry, I paid for it. 
LOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR 
The surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the foreground. 
Hi is being escorted past him to his cell. 
VOICE OVER They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and for once they may be right. 
Halfway up the corridor Hi points casually at the floor. 
HI You missed a spot. 
The Mopping Con turns to watch him recede. 
CON Grrrr... 
HIGH ANGLE CELL 
Same high shot with Moses on the top bunk, Hi on the lower. 
VOICE OVER More and more my thoughts turned to Ed, and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment. 
MOSES An' momma would frow the live crawdad in a pot of boiln' water. Well one day I decided to make my own crawdad... 
We begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring Hi. 
VOICE OVER ...an' I frew it in a pot, forgettin' to put in the water, ya see... 
Moses' voice is mixing down as we lose him from frame.

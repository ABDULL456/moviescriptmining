INT. A SUBWAY STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
The train pulls up and begins to empty, crowding the platform. 
INT. A SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS 
John exits the train, stuffs his hands into his pockets, and seeks to disappear into the crowd... 
...as KIRILL and TWO GUNMEN spot him. 
They move towards him... 
...following... 
...hands reaching beneath their jackets, fingers curling around triggers as silenced pistols are slipped free by steady hands. 
KIRILL Babushka. 
John slows his stride, hands out to his side, mind racing. 
SMASHCUT TO: 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
With consciousness fading, John leans back upon the floor, listening to the voices of his assailants. 
With his face hidden within his mask, Kirill chuckles - enjoying this- as he sucks on a fresh mint. 
KIRILL (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Then shit... let the fuckin' babushka fade away and let's get the fuck outta' here. 
SMASHCUT TO: 
EXT. A SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS 
John tenses, his features hard. 
Kirill grins, willing for John to give him reason to fire. 
Suddenly, a frail commuter stumbles into their midst- 
THUMP!   THUMP!   THUMP! 
-killing each with a single, silenced round to the heart. 
Kirill is dead before he hits the ground. 
Amidst a growing sense of chaos, MARCUS shares a parting glance with John, slips the pistol in his pocket, smiles, and tips his hat down low over his eyes. 
John returns the nod and disappears in the opposite direction. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A PARKING LOT - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
EXT. A PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
John walks up to an old, FORD LTD sedan. He reaches up into a rear wheel well, and rips free a set of keys which had been duct-taped within. 
He opens the trunk: we recognize the suitcases therein as his own. However, there is also a LARGE DUFFEL BAG as well which he opens, studies its contents, and -satisfied- zips shut. 
He closes the trunk, opens the front door- 
INT. A SEDAN - CONTINUOUS 
-slides inside, starts the engine- 
EXT. A PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
-and drives off. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. A STREET - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
A number of the quaint old buildings share both English and Russian signs. 
EXT. A STREET - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
With his hands stuffed deep into his pockets, John exits an alleyway and ducks into- 
INT. A CAFE - CONTINUOUS 
-where he motions "one" to the waitress.

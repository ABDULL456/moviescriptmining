49. EXTERIOR ONE-WAY STREET. 49. PETIE speeds limo the wrong way past one-way sign into path of oncoming speeding cop car. In the nick of time, PETIE turns a hard left skidding around corner onto bumpy cemetery road behind church. Cop car swerves right to avoid collision and careens into CABLE TV installation truck. COP jumps out of car and starts firing at limo. 
50. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 50. CHARDONNAY puts tape into limo cassette player and the entire GANG starts singing along with original gangsta rap song entitled "SHE'S A BANKABLE BITCH (and we don't need no pitch)." 
51. EXTERIOR CEMETERY ROAD. 51. COP fires again and hits limo trunk lock. Trunk door flies open and HONEY screams her lungs out, holding on for dear life. HEAVY METAL KIDS, hanging out in graveyard look up and see RAVEN yelling out car window with HONEY in trunk. 
RAVEN (Imitating "The Exorcist") Your mother sucks cocks in hell! HEAVY METAL KIDS look at each other in horror and run 
away in fear. Limo bumps down road at high speed and trunk door bangs shut, knocking HONEY into submission. Limo makes a fast right. 
52 SUBURBAN INTERSECTION. 52 Traffic is stopped in both lanes for a red light. PETIE screeches to a sudden stop. HE checks rear-view mirror and realizes they have escaped their POLICE pursuers. 
PETIE 
(TO GANG) We did it. PETIE grabs RODNEY from back seat and gives him a big kiss. A SUBURBAN LADY pulls up in her car next to limo on right. 
SUBURBAN LADY Sinclair, is that you? PETIE turns down radio and GANG freezes. 
CECIL (Suddenly turning into his old self) Hi, Mrs. Waltrup. 
SUBURBAN LADY Did you win the lottery? 
CECIL 
(POLITELY) No, ma'am, we were at a movie premiere. 
SUBURBAN LADY I don't go to the movies much, I wait for the video. 
CECIL Not me, I like the big screen. 
SUBURBAN LADY Say hello to your mom and dad for me. 
CECIL I sure will. SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off. 
CECIL (Smugly, to GANG) Casting has been completed! PETIE peels out in other direction. 53. Cut to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE," a run-down, 53. seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is interrupted by faint sirens in the distance. Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large industrial garage doors swing open and the white limo speeds inside. 54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54. "dressing room"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell fit for a movie queen. HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's chair with her name printed on the back, still wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown. LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror. We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his fingers. HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film crane. "Otto Preminger" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep. 
CECIL .Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented and I'm your new director... HONEY stares in confused horror. 
CECIL I'd like you to meet your co-stars ...I call them the "Sprocket Holes." HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now changed from their theater uniforms into their own scary "terrorist chic" fashions, gather around CECIL in a "crew-shot from hell" pose. 
CECIL This is Cherish... CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed "riot-girl" style, in a "SINEMA" T-shirt, steps forward. We see "Andy Warhol" tattooed on her thigh. 
CHERISH Hi, I played you in lots of porno movies. "Some Kind Of Happiness"? I've already shot it - only it's called "Some Kind Of Horniness." 
(PROUDLY) But that's all behind me. I'm an outlaw cinema girl now. 
CECIL Lyle? LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a "Herschell Gordon Lewis" tattoo across his skinny chest. 
LYLE Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your leading man. I've had a boner for you for years. HONEY pales. 
CECIL (Getting off crane and stepping towards HONEY) Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny... CHERISH starts writhing sexily. 
CECIL .but our film comes first. CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES undulate in sexual frustration. 
CECIL .And now for the crew. PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we 
see her "Sam Peckinpah" tattoo on her arm. 
PAM I'm Pam, the director of photography and you'd better hit your mark! CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's head, revealing the "Spike Lee" tattoo on her stomach. 
CHARDONNAY .and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH! I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound. LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding staple gun like a weapon.

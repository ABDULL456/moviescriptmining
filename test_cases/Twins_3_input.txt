C37   INT. BAR - DAY (LATER)                                          C37 
A booth at the back of the restaurant: Vince is seated with the two Klane brothers. He hands over the money he picked up from the BMW -- $4000. The smaller Klane counts it quickly. BURT KLANE This is only four thousand -- 
VINCE The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune. 
Bob suddenly punches Vince in the side knocking the breath out of him. BOB KLANE (ominous) Shut up. (CONTINUED)

LINDA I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him. 
BURT KLANE There you go -- (he counts Linda's money) -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow.                        * 
VINCE Twenty -- ?   But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again. BURT KLANE That's just the interest.    The                       * twenty's the principal.                                * 
37    INT. BAR - NEAR DOOR - DAY (LITTLE LATER)                    37 Linda is walking Vince out. VINCE That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me -- LINDA It's your birthday?   Why didn't you tell me? VINCE (suddenly honest) I can't take the kindness.    It gives me the shakes. LINDA You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict. They kiss.

A38    EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - MAGIC HOUR                A38 Vince brushes himself off, hesitates a moment, pulling on his left ear with his right hand. 
Immediately behind him, facing the opposite direction, is another man, also pulling on his left ear with his right hand. It is Julius -- 
-- Their backs are to each other. Without ever catching sight of one another, they move off, going their separate ways. Now, from this --

38     EXT. DOWNTOWN HOLLYWOOD STREET - NIGHT                     38 
Downtown Hollywood in all it's sleeze. There's a wax museum and a scientology center and every fast food place imaginable and people shouting as they sell things, "flowers" and street food and there's a porno house               * showing Tight 'n Tender and there's young people dressed like punks and old people boozed out and pimps and druggies and guys slumped unconscious in the gutter and crowds of tourists walking this way, that way, and there's noise and litter and one more thing -- -- There's Julius, case in hand, staring around, taking it all in. We're a long way from his island now. He studies all the humanity swirling around him -- CUT TO: 
CLOSEUP ON JULIUS And you can see it on his face:   He loves it. 
JULIUS (almost a whisper) ... How wonderful...

CUT TO: 
TWO HELMETLESS MOTORCYCLISTS 
watching Julius. More specifically, they are watching the expensive-looking leather-edged suitcase he carries in his hand. They look at the case a moment more, then Biker #2 gets his MACHINE PURRING softly. 
A45   EXT. WINDOW OF FREDERICK'S OF HOLLWYOOD - WINDOW - NIGHT A45 
You never saw such lingerie. 
PULL BACK to reveal: Julius, staring at it, shaking his head. JULIUS (to himself) What an amazing country. CUT TO: 
BIKER #1 ROARING up beside Julius, smiling ingratiatingly. BIKER #1 Got a light, pal? JULIUS Sorry, but I don't smoke... pal?

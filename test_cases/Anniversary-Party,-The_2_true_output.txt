MONICA (CONT'D) Would you sign it for me. (digs for a pen) I'm sure this is inappropriate. 
JOE We're way past inappropriate. 
Monica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest and moving toward her throat.  Manages not to burp. 
MONICA (as he signs it) I'll treasure this. 
He moves towards the doorway, Monica at his heals. 
JOE I need to leave you now. 
MONICA I will treasure this. 
JOE (shouting down the hall) Sally!!!! 
INT. DAILIES ROOM - LATER - DAY 
Sally's team prepares clues for charades.  Sally writes them down, throws them in a bowler hat.  Her teammates are Panes, Sophia, Mac, Ryan, Sanford and Jeffrey. 
SALLY Panes? 
PANES From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle... 
MAC What? 
SALLY Trust him. 
PANES It's Shostakovich. 
Ryan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out, delighted. 
SALLY Sandy... 
SANFORD The Wind Up Bird Chronicle. 
SALLY (turns to him) Ryan? 
RYAN (pleased) I didn't know you had this. 
SALLY Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us? 
RYAN Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it? 
JUDY Good idea. 
RYAN There's not a chance in hell anyone will get it... 
MAC Down by Law. 
SOPHIA Who's not going to get that in fifteen seconds. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Joe's team works on it's clues.  Teammates: Gina, Cal, Clair, Skye, Monica, Jerry and Mary-Lynn.  Everyone is talking over each other and fighting for attention.  There are a lot of strong personalities here. 
JOE Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal. 
CAL Why last? 
MONICA The Katzenjammer Kids. 
There's a hush. 
MONICA (CONT'D) You know.  It's the Funnies.  The Katzenjammer Kids.  It's my mother's favorite charade's clue.  No one ever gets it. 
Pause. 
JOE Alright.  Good.  Fine, I vote for that. 
He writes it down. 
MONICA With a "Z."  K. A. T. Z.

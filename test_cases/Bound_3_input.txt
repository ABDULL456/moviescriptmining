CAESAR Violet! 
He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency door. 
CAESAR Fuck! 
INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as he charges after her. 
CAESAR Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now! 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the clippers. 
INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT 
Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators. 
She pounds the button and waits. 
VIOLET Come on.  Come on, please. 
She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens. 
Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the exit.  When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of the elevator -- 
And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close. 
CAESAR Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch. 
Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the stairs. 
INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket and dials a number. 
Mickey answers on the car phone. 
VIOLET Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey! 
MICKEY (V.O.) Violet? 
Whispering, she acts terrified. 
VIOLET He made me help him, Mickey, God, I was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's coming - Oh God! 
She hangs up, eyes blazing. 
INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
The elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door. 
VIOLET Corky? 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut rope. 
VIOLET Corky! 
She looks at the wall separating the apartment. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT 
Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door. 
Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but -- 
The money is gone. 
Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag. 
The tracks lead to the bathroom. 
Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to Corky's empty boots. 
Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench. 
At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as -- 
The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch. 
Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down on his arm. 
He screams as the gun hits the floor.

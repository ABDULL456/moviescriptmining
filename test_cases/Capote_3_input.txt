JOURNALIST #2 Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, sexual molestation of the women? 
DEWEY No. 
JOURNALIST #2 Anything else stolen? 
DEWEY Kenyon's radio seems to be the only... 
JOURNALIST #3 The boy was sixteen? 
DEWEY Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen. 
JOURNALIST #2 It's her friend that found them? 
DEWEY Laura Kinney. 
JOURNALIST #2 Spell that? 
DEWEY I assume you're okay with the Laura part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave her be. 
Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself heard above the rest: 
OLD MAN There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, a whole bunch of Mexicans... 
DEWEY (standing, stubs out cigarette) George, it's good to see you again. I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. We're going to find whoever did this. Four good people from our community are dead. Let's remember that. Okay with you? (holds up a notice) The West Kansas Farm Committee's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest. Please print that. (moving to the exit) Thank you all for coming. 
The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches his eye. Dewey exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 
Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back, looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks almost to himself. 
TRUMAN Mr. Dewey's protective of the Clutters. I wonder how well he knew them... 
Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice. 
TRUMAN He was foxy with that old man. (turns to Nelle) Are you ever gonna let me drive? 
NELLE Truman, you're a menace. You can barely see over the wheel. 
Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back. 
NELLE This make you miss Alabama? 
TRUMAN (rolling window down, shakes his head) Not even a little bit. 
He leans his head out, closes his eyes. 
EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET 
Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway. 
CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse. 
FADE OUT. 
EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING 
A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth. 
TRUMAN Hello. 
Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up to a group of THREE GIRLS. 
NELLE Morning. 
GIRL #1 Hi. 
NELLE Can any of you tell me where I'd find Laura Kinney? 
GIRL #1 Oh, um... 
The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, 
NELLE (gently) Is that her? With the tall boy?

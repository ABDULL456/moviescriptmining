Earthquakes. Floods. Ice storms. War. Riots. Chaos and injustice. \nNARRATOR(CONT'D) Climate. Nations. Borders. All were in upheaval. Humanity itself turned as violent as the planet. Civilization threatened to collapse. And then... a solution was found. The crumbling, teetering legal system was merged with the overburdened police, creating a powerful and efficient hybrid. Trained equally in jurisprudence and combat, these new guardians (X) of Society could dispense both justice and punishment. They were (X) police, jury and executioner, all in one. They were... The Judges. \nthru OMITTED thru \n5 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 5 \nIt looks like the beginning of time... or its end. Nothing grows here. Nothing could. This is the CURSED EARTH. With a WHIRR, a SHUTTLE appears in the sky. We PAN it to a GIANT CITY WALL. A LOCK-LIKE GATE chugs open. The shuttle ENTERS. \n6 INT.

Elevated skyways are filled with traffic. Flying Barges and Shuttles service the highest levels. Dominating all is a building shaped like an EAGLE: The Hall of Justice.

While we were blinking, he kicked a fallen weapon up from the floor and caught \nDREDD No... Death. He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's ARMOR, pings off.

Its actions are less smooth than before, and its voice seems off, too. \n(CONTINUED) \n55 CONTINUED: 55 \nFOOD ROBOT Ummm, umm, yumm! Healthful and nutritious food rations, ready to eat! Dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd. Hershey follows. She watches, puzzled, as he steps in the automaton's path, takes an assault rifle from another Judge and AIMS it! \nDREDD \n(TO ROBOT) Halt! You have ten seconds to surrender. Ten. Nine. \nHERSHEY \n(PUZZLED) Dredd, It's just a servo-droid - \nDREDD (aside to Hershey) The guide wire in the floor isn't working. (to the robot) Five! Four! \nFOOD ROBOT Ah, just put your credit in your selection and - credit in the slot and-and - shit! The robot stops.

But - I - I had no choice, judge - He sees Dredd's impassive face, turns to Hershey's more sympathetic one. \nFERGIE(CONT'D) They were killing each other up there, I had to get out! I only hacked the droid to save my life! It was the only way! \n(LEAVING) I pray you're right, Dredd. \nWITH DREDD \nS Ch As Griffin leaves, Dredd turns.

But Fargo won't let him she hook. \nFARGO Most of my time where? \nDREDD At the Academy... Sir. \nFARGO Don't you mean at the Academy wiping Cadet's Asses? That is what they say in the squad room, isn't it? \nDREDD It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City.

KIRILL OK.     Merry Christmas.   Drive safely. 
Ozim giggles.      Anna departs. 
20   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                               20 
Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars. The women are all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking, still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's bike. 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) Nice bike. 
ANNA What? 
NIKOLAI Nice bike. 
ANNA Thank you. 
NIKOLAI A Ural. You don't see them anymore. 
ANNA It was my dad's. 
NIKOLAI How much do you want for it? 
Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit and tattoos say it all. 
ANNA (irritated) It has sentimental value. 
Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers.

NIKOLAI `Sentimental value'.   I've heard of that. 
Anna puts her helmet on.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D) You're not staying for the party? 
ANNA No. 
NIKOLAI Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead? 
Anna mounts her bike. 
ANNA It's Christmas. Everything's closed. 
Nikolai smiles. 
NIKOLAI Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know? 
Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette. 
21   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                        21 
Sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken. 
STEPAN Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve? 
Stepan takes a large sip of vodka. 
ANNA I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit. 
HELEN (softly) For as long as you want. 
STEPAN I knew he would run away from you.

ANNA He didn't run away. You make me sound like a burning building. 
STEPAN Black men always run away. 
HELEN Oh Stepan! 
STEPAN What?   I am allowed to be honest?

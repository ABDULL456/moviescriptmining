CATHY There are some mixed signals coming out of here, aren't there? (phone rings; she answers) Hi. Working... I can't write down a number now. Call me back. (to Matt) The script? 
MATT It's really good. I get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity. 
CATHY I want to hear everything. You want to go page by page? 
MATT If it's okay. I kind of work on these things in a private... it's just... it's a little better for me if I don't... 
CATHY (hurt) Okay. 
MATT Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me. 
CATHY Please. I understand. 
An uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses him. A sound escapes him. They get up and begin walking to the bedroom. 
MATT I swear to God, I don't know which thing I want more, the sex or the conversation afterwards. 
CATHY (a smile) What do you mean? 
INT. CATHY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
As they enter and move to the bed where Matt starts undressing. 
MATT I mean I haven't been to bed with anyone since Jeannie got here... I haven't talked to anyone the way I need to. (cradling her breast) I haven't seen anything this beautiful. I haven't felt this good about life. I mean, I've been lonely, Cathy. 
CATHY (as he enters her) I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've never felt more like turning my phone off. 
She twists her body gracefully, sexily towards the phone. 
MATT You can't shut the phone off. I left this number with Jeannie's sitter. 
CATHY I don't understand what you're worried about. 
MATT I'm not worried. But if the phone was off, I would worry. 
CATHY But I get a lot of calls. 
MATT Oh. 
CATHY I could put the machine on 'monitor,' but it's going to be... I don't know. 
MATT It will be okay. I think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone. Turn it off, monitor, whatever. 
CATHY Okay. 
She twists toward the phone again--not quite so beautifully. 
OTHER ANGLE 
As she hits the "monitor" button, then turns back to him. 
CATHY You look so serious. 
MATT I am so serious. 
CATHY'S POV 
Matt totally there... this is major for him, then he does something sensitive... reads her concern over the depth of his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't help it. 
ON CATHY 
She likes him. 
THE COUPLE 
As they make love... their union thrown off kilter by the phone messages which roll in periodically as they thrust and sweat towards intimacy. 
YOUNGER MALE VOICE (broadly) Hi, Cathy... All my magazines came today... Read the new Vanity Fair, they take apart three people we hate... Spy is bad this month... Scorsese didn't get the Time cover, the plane crash did... ha, ha, ha... Why aren't you at the office? You know, I'm getting to the point where I prefer to reach people's machines... Bye. 
The love making continues as the calls continue. 
MALE D PERSON VOICE Cathy? Are you there? Hello... Are you there?? I'm going to count to ten. One, two, three... (then to someone passing his office) Did you go to the screening last night? What did you think? That makes two bombs in a row for her. (into phone) ...four, five, six... Pick up if you're there. I've got major gossip... major screwup. It could be good for us. 
Cathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divided by the offer on the phone... she shakes it off. 
MATT Is this the kind of crap you listen to all day? 
CATHY Please, we're making love here. 
BURKE'S VOICE (incredibly depressed) If the TV show bombs, there's going to be a dance party on my grave. I don't give a crap. Nothing seems to have a point anymore. I'm really questioning everything... including action-adventure... Don't tell anyone I'm down. Even destroy the message tape. Don't tell anyone I said to destroy the message tape. Don't even give hints that there's something you can't tell them, but you wish you could... I'm losing it. I'm losing it. I'm losing it. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. 
The sound of a hang up... the couple having more difficulty making love...

JUNO (aghast) Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay? 
MARK God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh? 
JUNO My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross. 
MARK That suits you. 
JUNO Uh, thanks. 
MARK You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this. 
JUNO I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys. 
MARK You're something else. 
A door suddenly slams upstairs. Vanessa's home. 
MARK Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here. 
JUNO Why? What the big deal? 
MARK Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.' 
JUNO I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage. 
Juno jumps up and rushes out. 
MARK Wait... aww, crap! 
INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
Vanessa slides her BRIEFCASE off her shoulder and ventures into the living room. She's struggling to carry some oversized shopping bags. 
VANESSA Mark? Are you home? I want to show you some things I picked up. 
Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ULTRASOUND photo. Mark trails behind her. 
JUNO Hi Vanessa! 
Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound. 
VANESSA Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong? 
JUNO Nothing... 
VANESSA Then what's going on? 
JUNO I went to the doctor today. 
Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled. 
VANESSA Is the baby okay? 
JUNO Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this... 
She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her arm around her. 
VANESSA What... 
JUNO This is the baby. Your baby. 
Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief. 
VANESSA Oh my God... 
JUNO (kindly) Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"

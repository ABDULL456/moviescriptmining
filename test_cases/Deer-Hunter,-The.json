{"train": "GUYS IN THE CAR (chanting) Do it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do it! Do it, Nick! Go! \nThe car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep. \nNICK Back! All hands to the rear! \nALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE. \nGUYS IN BACK SEAT Easy... 'At's it, easy! Easy, Nick... Easy! \nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY \nThe Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground and skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER. \nINT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes. ANGELA leans forward into a mirror. \nANGELA (sincerely) I do. \nA pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again. \nANGELA (CONT'D) (heartfelt) I do. \nANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse. \nANGELA (CONT'D) I do, I do, I do!!! \nANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and unrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself on the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the pillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it out she sees that something is written on the back: \nANGELA (CONT'D) (reading, slow) \"This is it -- more or less... Love, Mom.\" \nANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of Michaelangelo's \"David\". ANGELA stares at the figure for a long, long moment... \nANGELA (CONT'D) Oh, wow. \nINT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY \nThe place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret from the hunters, some power beyond their own. \nJOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting congratulations. \nINT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nLINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder. There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud... and then silence. \nLINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it all on a tray. \nINT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through the open window, snow is blowing in. \nLINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the tray on the bureau and kneels beside him. \nLINDA Daddy? \nFATHER (mumbles) Go... fucking hell! \nLINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins cursing again. \nFATHER (CONT'D) Fucking shit... all around, like a sea! Like an ocean! \nLINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in the face and pushes her violently across the room. \nLINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her. \nFATHER (CONT'D) Fucking bitch... All bitches! \nHe swings, catches her in the face again, hard. \nLINDA Daddy...! Daddy, it's me! \nFATHER Hate 'em. Fucking bitches! \nLINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. \nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY \nSeven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently through the falling snow. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY \nThe WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive -- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter comes from inside. \nNICK I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too. \nMERLE (with a glance to the window) I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo. \nNICK (laughs) Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo? \nMERLE Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do. \nNICK (laughs) You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac! \nMERLE Yeah. (he grins) When it comes to hunting, that's true. \nCursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open. NICK and MERLE go out. \nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY \nNICK Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys! \nALBERT It won't open. \nNICK You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there. \nALBERT Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it. \nNICK Here. Hit it here. \nALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps open. \nALBERT Hey, that's neat. \nNICK nods. \nALBERT (CONT'D) That's new, isn't it? \nNICK Couple of weeks... Listen -- \nALBERT I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been. \nVINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him. \nVINCE Hey, guys... \nJOHN Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville. \nALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest, thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent, mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up. \nBRIDESMAID 1 Albert, what are you doing! \nBRIDESMAID 2 Hurry up, you guys! \nBRIDESMAID 3 Who's got their carnations? \nBRIDESMAID 4 Here. They're right here. \nBRIDESMAID 1 Look at you! You're all a mess! \nBRIDESMAID 3 Put on their carnations! \nBRIDESMAID 1 Who's got a pin? \nAs the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a small suitcase in her hand. \nNICK (crosses) Linda... \nLINDA Hi. (forces a smile) Nick, your shoes are soaking. \nNICK Linda, what's the matter? \nLINDA (tries to toss it off) Oh... You know... \nShe fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks around, pulls her inside the trailer. \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY \nNICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her suitcase in her lap. \nLINDA (with great effort) I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because... \nNICK Sure. Are you kidding? Sure. \nLINDA I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking -- \nNICK (kneels in front of her) Linda... Hey, Linda... \nNICK What kind of beer would you like? \nLINDA (laughing) I don't know. \nNICK (to Merle) Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life. \nNICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub, finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks transformed. She begins chattering and laughing. \nMERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk. \nMERLE Sorry. \nLINDA (laughs) It's okay, Merle. \nNICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves. \nMERLE (catching Linda's expression) I guess you like Nick. \nLINDA (nods) Yes. \nMERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be trying to contain a floodtide of emotion. \nMERLE Fuckin' Nick... (clears his throat) Fuckin' Nick... gives. (he nods, bangs his fist on the table) Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives. \nINT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT \nThe rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing and low moans. What light there is comes from the colored glass ball revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now playing sweet and low. \nThe front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform. On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are brightly polished. \nSERGEANT Pow! \nThe SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance floor. \nINT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT \nThe SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS, plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at the end of one of the white trestle tables. \nINT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her feet and marches around holding her above his head. \nGIRL Albert, what are you doing... Albert! \nINT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT \nVINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED. \nVINCE Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass! \nJOHN Oh, well... \nVINCE Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now. \nVINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass. FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts his hand right back where FRED had it. \nINT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT \nNICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the SERGEANT. \nMERLE Nick, he just came back. \nNICK From Nam? \nMERLE Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son! \nMERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to the SERGEANT. \nMERLE (CONT'D) We, ah... We're going too. \nThe SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile. \nSERGEANT Pow! \nMERLE What? \nThe SERGEANT keeps smiling. \nMERLE (CONT'D) (to Nick) What'd he say? \nNICK Pow. \nMERLE Pow? \nSAL All set, hon? \nANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down. Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark naked, running in front of the car with colored paper streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a realm of pure ethereal space. \nNICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes. \nGUYS Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin' Merle!... Unbelievable! \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nThe road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes straight and disappears down the hill. \nALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly. NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the hill. \nEXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT \nMERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow. \nNICK comes to a stop a few feet away. \nNICK Merle? \nMERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he gives NICK an almost feral grin. \nMERLE You think we'll ever come back? \nNICK (startled) From Nam? \nMERLE Yeah. \nNICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say. \nMERLE (CONT'D) I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that. \nNICK (half laughing) Merle -- \nMERLE Promise! You gotta promise! \nNICK You got it. \nMERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had been pressing on him. \nMERLE (with a laugh) Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do it! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT \nNICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming past. \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nNICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles. \nGUYS (singing) Let me be free! Let me be free! If... you... will let me be free... You'll... always be happy... with me-e-e-e!!! \nALBERT (making a trumpet sound) Wa-wa-wa!... Waaaaa!!! \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nTale Cadillac comes blasting by... \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nNICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced conversation. \nALBERT She fucked you? \nJOHN She fucked me. \nALBERT She fucked me too. \nJOHN She fucked you? \nALBERT She fucked me too. \nThere is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes open. \nJOHN She fucked us both. \nJOHN You just put mustard on your Hershey bar. \nALBERT (nods) Good... Pass the beer. \nVINCE (pointing to a location beside the road) Here, here! This is it! \nMERLE (milk slopping over him) Watch it, shithead! \nVINCE (pounds Nick on the shoulder) Here! This is it! \nALBERT It is not! \nVINCE It is too! Now you passed it! \nMERLE It's ahead, by the tree. \nNICK It's ahead, Vince. \nVINCE That isn't it! There's no way that's it... Unless they changed it. They might have changed it. \nNICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder. \nVINCE (CONT'D) They changed it. That's what they did. This is it but they changed it. \nEXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN \nThe sky is just turning grey. A cold wind is blowing, moaning in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open roadway. The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos. \nVINCE This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it. \nALBERT You're full of shit. \nVINCE Who's full of shit? \nALBERT You're full of shit! \nVINCE I'm telling you, they changed it! \nALBERT They did not! \nVINCE They did too! \nALBERT Jesus, it's freezing! \nNICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the corner of the seats. \nNICK Whee-uu! \nALBERT Jesus! \nJOHN Holy shit! \nVINCE Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks? \nMERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks over. \nVINCE (CONT'D) (rummaging around in the mess of things he has brought) Never mind, Merle. Never mind, I got 'em... Where the hell are my pants? Anyone see my pants?... Who the hell took my pants! \nVINCE begins plunging around. \nOTHERS Fuckhead! Watch it! \nVINCE Somebody took my pants... I know I brought pants. \nVINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with nothing and steps out of the car. \nVINCE (CONT'D) All right. All right, you guys. Whoever took my pants, I want 'em back! \nEXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATER \nShots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHN stand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at each other. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down vest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsack lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it contains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots. \nMERLE Sure I got boots. I got boots right here. \nVINCE Then lemme have 'em. \nMERLE No. \nVINCE (both hands in the air) No!!!? \nMERLE No. \nVINCE What do you mean, no??? \nThe GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags him of f to the table. \nINT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY \nSAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger than SAL, and he is trembling with terror. \nSAL Hey, listen, you can do it. (Sal nods, smiles) Believe me, you can do it. We can both do it. Then we go home, see? Then we go home! \nSAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around, cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD. \nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR. \nSAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry. \nINT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY \nA half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back, DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the floor. \nOn the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn at the knee. \nMERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND LOOKING OUT AT THE \"PITS\". \nEXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY \nThe pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip. \nSUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR. \nINT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY \nMERLE turns away from the \"pits\". He looks down at SAL, then he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as if he had been having a long argument. \nMERLE I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come. \nNICK What are you, God? \nMERLE Listen, asshole, it's up to us! \nNICK They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now! \nMERLE What are you, hoping? \nNICK What else? \nMERLE I thought you might be praying. \nNICK I'm doing that too. \nMERLE I suppose you wish you were somewhere else? \nNICK What do you think? \nMERLE Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out! \nNICK You're right... Okay, you're right. \nMERLE (grabs him) Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!! \nNICK (stands) Okay, okay! (he straightens his shoulders) Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal? \nMERLE Forget Sal. \nNICK What do you mean? \nMERLE I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick. \nNICK Forget Sal? \nMERLE Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you! \nNICK Merle... \nMERLE LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO! \nA shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn. \nThrough the bars of the \"tiger cage\" we see the V.C. GUARDS coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the pearl-handled revolver. \nNICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him. \nMERLE (CONT'D) (calm) We gotta play with more bullets. \nNICK We what? \nThe GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin shouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his lips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and then nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right in. \nMERLE (CONT'D) He's terrific! Great fucking guy! \nThe GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder and begins sticking in two more cartridges. \nMERLE (CONT'D) KA-POW!!! BA-ROOMIE!!! \nMERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing his finger at him, as if in fury. \nMERLE (CONT'D) Both of us may have to pull on this, so get your shit in fuckin' shape!!! (to the GUARDS) Him or me!!! Now we got it, him or me!!! (he rubs his hands and sits back down) Place your bets, motherfuckers! Now we're going! Now we got a game! \nThe GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins it. \nMERLE (CONT'D) Watch! Now watch! He's going to get it. And then KA-POW! BA-ROOMIE!!! \nThe muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are yelling and shouting. \nMERLE You guys think I'm in trouble, right? \nMERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it... \nMERLE (CONT'D) No way! Never!!! (he begins to chant) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA! MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA! MERLE LIVES LONG! Lemme hear it. Come on, motherfuckers, lemme hear it! \nMERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him JOIN IN: \nMERLE (CONT'D) (with GUARDS) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA! MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA! MERLE LIVES LONG! \nMERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD IN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution. \nMERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an empty chamber. \nMERLE (CONT'D) See! Nothing to it. \nHe pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage. \nMERLE (CONT'D) You got an empty chamber and it's in your mind! Just put that empty chamber in the gun! \nNICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty chamber. \nThe GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE. \nMERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated, his brow furrowed in a mighty frown. \nNICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if throwing back a challenge. \nMERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no longer possessed the strength to pick it up. \nMERLE (CONT'D) (gloom) Who's for Merle? (he thumps his fist on the table) Is anyone for Merle??? \nMERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table, still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body sag over it. \nMERLE (CONT'D) Who here is for Merle...? \nThere is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the rain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The GUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by MERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little children. \nMERLE (CONT'D) Who... here... is for Merle...? \nMERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very dramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in. \nMERLE (CONT'D) (with GUARDS) MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA! MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA! MERLE IS MAGIC -- HA! \nMERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin. TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47, they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor. \nIt is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on -- uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal... \nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY \nBarely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE. \nINT. THATCHED HUT - DAY \nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and lets go with the AK 47. \nEXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY \nMERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals. As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope. \nMERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath, SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo with an expression of pure terror. \nSAL Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home? \nThere is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible. MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK. \nGENERAL (CONT'D) (as they take off) Y'know, there's more fucking maniacs coming out of this conflict... \nMERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below the REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands. \nEXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY \nMERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS, HOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a speck in the vast human torrent. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY \nThe room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby hydraulic mechanism. \nEXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY \nBlack BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot concrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE PFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets into the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT. \nINT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY \nNICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair. Suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in. \nDOCTOR Is your name Solomon? \nNICK shakes his head. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Are you sure? \nNICK nods. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Lemme see this. \nThe DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Is this yours? \nNICK nods. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) This isn't yours. This can't be yours! I'm going to take this one off and cut it up... (he extracts a pair of scissors and does so) Shred it... so no one gets a hold of it. What I'm going to do now, I'm going to give you this one. (he staples a new marker around NICK's neck) There. How's that? Does that feel better? \nNICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) That one's yours. \nThe DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek and whine... \nNICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently, then closes his wallet and puts it away. \nINT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY \nBanks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is playing. \nNICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again, peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back. NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone -- and then he stops, frozen with fear. \nGUM CHEWER BEHIND Go on, babe. Take it. 'S all yours! \nNICK (mumbles) You go ahead. \nCAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY \nNICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his eye. \nNICK (calling) Sal...! Sal!!! \nNICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even looking. \nVehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close. \nNICK (CONT'D) Sorry... Thought you were someone else. \nThe SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a long swallow. \nINT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT \nThe place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene contortions. \nNICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention. \nNICK I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say. \nBAR GIRL Everybody love Linda. \nNICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion. Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again. \nNICK (CONT'D) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow... \nNICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious determination, as if this link were the last, as if by staring at it hard he could make it hold. \nNICK (CONT'D) (his voice thin, cracking) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow -- \nThere is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE. \nNICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he crosses toward it. \nEXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT \nA tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the right temple. \nMAN (V.O.) If you are brave and lucky I can make you rich. \nNICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S accent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a bottle of champagne and several glasses. \nMAN (CONT'D) You have played? \nNICK stares at the MAN, nods. \nMAN (CONT'D) Once you have played it is not so hard. Cigarette? \nNICK shakes his head. \nMAN (CONT'D) You seem... disturbed. \nNICK I... No. You do this for money? \nMAN Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve. (smiles) But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do. (gives NICK a glass) Where did you play? \nNICK Up north. \nMAN Ah yes. Of course... So few survive. (smiles) La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release? \nNICK Playing. \nMAN (raises his eyebrows) Playing? \nNICK We... Three bullets. \nMAN And then you... \nThe MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a pistol. NICK nods. \nMAN (CONT'D) How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are? \nNICK Nick. \nARMAND Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you know that I have a cousin who is called Nicholas and a nephew Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit, en famille. In the family. \nThere is another SHOT from inside and another round of APPLAUSE. \nNICK I have to go. \nARMAND But you must come in. \nNICK No, I -- \nARMAND But I insist. \nNICK I have to go. \nARMAND You are frightened, no? \nNICK nods. \nARMAND (CONT'D) Of what is there to be afraid? The war? The war is no problem. It is a joke, a silly thing. I make one call and get you out. \nARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss. NICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow. \nNICK See, I'm going home. \nARMAND Ah yes. Of course. (smiles) To the girl who waits. \nNICK (gives him a look and sits) Yeah... Do you mind if I sit? \nARMAND But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --? \nNICK (weary, shaking his head) No. None of that. \nA huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing angrily, as if it were full of bees. \nThe TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in his cab and pulls away. \nINT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK \nNICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw swallows. . \nNICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like that of an animal run to the ground. \nNICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands and looks out. \nEXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK \nThe five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the pale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged clouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire. \nINT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK \nNICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly -- stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair, then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and fast as he can. \nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN \nThe banner stretching to the house across the street has been whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats, and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car. The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard. The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties. She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave them in the back seat and take off again. \nJOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way. \nLINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of coffee. \nEXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN \nNICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway, watching. \nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN \nLINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer. \nEXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN \nNICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket, drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs. Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it with his fingers. Then he starts down again. \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN \nCakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is trying her God-damnedest. \nThere is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses to the door and opens it. \nNICK Guess who. \nLINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in. \nLINDA (throws herself in his arms) Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back! \nShe hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull apart. \nLINDA (CONT'D) I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... (back in his arms) I thought someone stole you away! \nNICK No. \nLINDA Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! \nThey pull apart. \nLINDA (CONT'D) How are you? \nNICK Fine. I'm fine. How are you? \nLINDA Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound? \nNICK (anger) That was nothing. That wasn't anything. \nLINDA But -- \nNICK It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it. \nLINDA I made you a sweater. (she gets it) Here... You have to take that off. \nNICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him \nLINDA (CONT'D) I couldn't remember your exact size. \nThe sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to NICK's knees. \nLINDA (CONT'D) (smoothly) Oh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a little too big... (she pulls the sweater back off) ... but I can easily fix that. Easily. One thing about wool sweaters, they are such a cinch to fix. \nALBERT It's Nick! \nVINCE Nick...? (sees him) Jesus, Nick! \nVINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the same. \nVINCE (CONT'D) Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right? \nALBERT Yeah. \nNICK I got delayed. I -- \nALBERT (hugs him) Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean... \nVINCE Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think? \nALBERT I know, but... \nVINCE What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe! \nALBERT Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired. \nNICK I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine. \nTHEY start for the cars. \nNICK (CONT'D) How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been? \nVINCE Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat. \nALBERT Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married! \nNICK Married? \nALBERT Tell him, Vince. \nVINCE Yeah. I did. Yeah...What the hell. \nVINCE makes a gesture, shrugs. \nNICK (after a beat) Well, who'd you get married to? \nVINCE Aw, it's a long story! \nALBERT Tell him, Vince! \nVINCE Well... you remember Cynthia? \nNICK Cynthia! Sure. \nVINCE (nods) That's who. \nNICK (fast recovery) Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great! \nALBERT Show him the gun. Hey, show him the gun, Vince. \nVINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and Weston in a holster on his hip. \nNICK What the hell's that for? \nVINCE What's it for?? \nALBERT He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious! \nNICK You mean...? \nVINCE Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught! \nALBERT Vince thinks... you know... \nNICK (nods) Hey... hey, let's drink! \nINT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT \nNICK comes through the CROWD OF STEELWORKERS shaking hands. The STEELWORKERS treat him with immense respect. There are no cracks; there are no jokes. They squeeze his shoulder, pat his back, reaching out for him, touching him. \nSTEELWORKERS Nice going! Good going, Nick! You did good, boy; you did fine! Let him through! Damn good, boy! Let him through! He's all right! Did his part and he did it good! Let him through! Let's make a little room! \nJOHN pushes out of the crowd. \nJOHN Nick! Hey, Nick! (gives him a big hug) Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh? \nNICK Fine. Hey, I'm fine. \nNICK Angela, I just heard Sal was alive. \nANGELA Sure. Why not. \nNICK Where? Where is he? \nANGELA Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up. \nNICK You talk to him? \nANGELA Oh, sure... Twice a day. \nNICK What hospital is he in? Where? \nANGELA Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing. \nNICK Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way. \nANGELA He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick! \nANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands up. \nShe stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket. \nNICK Angela...? \nANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding NICK's eyes. \nANGELA Did you ever think life would turn out like this? \nNICK No. \nANGELA You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it. \nThe door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver. \nSAL'S MOTHER Here. This is it. What you do, you stick this in here. \nPushes the toaster in NICK's arms. \nSAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Then you jab it, see. Jab it good. Something's in it. Hear? Listen. Something's in it. What? What's there? \nEXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT \nNICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother gave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church we hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and dark, like a great river rolling through the night. \nCAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears glistening in his eyes. \nEXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT \nWe see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half open and snow is blowing in. \nEXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT \nNICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in his hands. \nINT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself. \nLINDA It just seems sort of strange coming to a motel... Like a honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez vous ... Not parlez-vous! (she giggles) What am I saying? That's those cocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I mean is rendezvous. Some kind of rendezvous. \nLINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and poking a finger in her mouth. \nLINDA (CONT'D) Do you know what I mean?... Nick? \nNICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes one last look at herself and goes out. \nINT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAs LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she stops dead in her tracks. \nNICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe off and sound asleep. \nLINDA Nick? \nNICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a wistful shake. \nLINDA (CONT'D) Nick...? Nick, it's me! \nBut NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately, she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest. \nNICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND. \nNICK In the timeless words of Squire Albert... \nVINCE cracks up, howling. \nVINCE Squire Albert... \nVINCE collapses on the floor. \nNICK In the timeless words of Squire Albert... \nALL (in a ragged chorus) Hey! Fuckin' A!!! \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nNICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with groceries. \nLINDA Nick? \nNICK Right here. \nLINDA crosses to the doorway. \nLINDA What are you doing? \nNICK Oh. Nothing... Sitting. \nLINDA You're going hunting? \nNICK (blankly) What? \nLINDA I see you're going hunting. \nNICK looks at the equipment on the floor. \nNICK Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to. \nLINDA That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. \nNICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with pain and his voice is cracked with emotion. \nNICK You know how sometimes you're going along... You're going along... And that's all...! One thing is right after another, like steps... And you step along. \nNICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking. \nNICK (CONT'D) I don't know where that is... It's gone! That's gone! \nA car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE and ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer. \nVINCE (V.O.) Let's go!!! \nALBERT (V.O.) Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!! \nNICK I gotta go. \nNICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak. \nNICK (CONT'D) I'll be... I don't know... Couple of days. \nNICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE. SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY \nSnow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the whispering, fitful, spinning flakes. \nNICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill, following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY \nA magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks, looking down the slope. \nNICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow. \nThe BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly and vanishes into the trees. \nEXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY \nVINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that it sounds like a full scale war. \nVINCE What are you, kiddin'? Are you kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I coulda had her! She...! One time she begged me, practically begged me. Listen, I had her tit, which was out, in one hand, and my other hand... You know that mole on the inside of her right leg? Well, I was past that mole, way past that mole, and I was -- \nJOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope, single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush over to the TWO DEAD DEER. \nVINCE (CONT'D) (coming after them) Nice shootin', you guys. Not bad. Not half bad. \nThe wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black speck in the endless expanse of shifting white. \nAs NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in the driving snow. \nThe wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock. \nNICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty feet away, looking down at him. \nNICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights down the barrel. \nWE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT. NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT. \nNICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW. \nNICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE HAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE. \nNICK (grins) Damn... God damn... \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY \nNICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock face. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it might be something from a dream. \nNICK (shouts) Hey! Hey... okay! \nINT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT \nThe Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the wind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out cold. ALBERT and VINCE are both drunk and arguing bitterly. \nALBERT You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away! \nVINCE Who? Who is? \nALBERT You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know? \nVINCE I know! I fuckin' know! \nALBERT You don't! \nVINCE I do!!! \nALBERT I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know! \nVINCE She does not! \nALBERT Then what's the gun for! What's this for? \nVINCE In case!!! The gun's in case!!! \nALBERT In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?! \nVINCE She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!! \nALBERT She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!! \nVINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and cocks it. \nVINCE (shrieking) Say that one more time!... Say it!!! Go on, say it!!! \nNICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up. NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches over, pulls NICK away. \nALBERT Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way. \nNICK (grimly) Yeah. \nVINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face. \nVINCE What the hell was that! (picks up the pistol) What did you think? Did you think it was loaded! \nNICK You loaded it, Vince! I saw you! \nVINCE The fuck I did!!! \nNICK The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that! \nNICK takes the pistol. \nVINCE What do you think? You think I don't know!!! \nNICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR. \nFor a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore. \nNICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands... \nEXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nThe lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping carts which a CLERK is banging together. \nNICK gets out of his car and goes in. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nTwo or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front. \nCHECKER She's in back. \nNICK Thanks. \nCHECKER How was huntin'? \nNICK Oh. Fine. \nCHECKER Get anything? \nNICK No. \nCHECKER Too bad. \nNICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair, crying. \nNICK Linda... Honey, what's wrong? \nLINDA (helpless shrug) I don't know. \nNICK Hey. Look. There must be something. \nLINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face. \nLINDA I'm just so lonely. \nNICK C'mon. I've got the car. \nLINDA (shakes her head) I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. \nNICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages. \nINT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nThe CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together. \nNICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car. \nEXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT \nNICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out of the door and crosses towards him. \nNICK You okay? \nLINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door. \nLINDA Let's make love, Nick. \nLINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight. \nLINDA (CONT'D) Let's make love forever! \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nLINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across the pillows, like a dancer leaping. \nNICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her, fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT \nThe wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest, polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer. \nTHE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY. \nTHE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT, THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET. \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nNICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to the window again. \nEXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT \nThe street is empty. The MAN is gone. \nNICK (CONT'D) Shit! \nNICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment. \nSAL Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I mean, if it's socks or something just let 'em go. \nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY \nNICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere. \nSAL (V.O.) Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now. \nNICK It's not socks, Sal. \nNICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the bundles of bills. \nThe paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket for a long time. \nNICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and unfolds it. \nTHE CARD READS \"EXHIBITIONS\". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON. \nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY \nNICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying. \nSAL Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't understand. \nNICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself back with effort. \nNICK It's Merle, Sal. \nSAL Merle? ... Merle's alive? (NICK nods) How do you know? \nNICK I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind. \nSAL Merle gave me this? \nNICK Yeah. \nSAL But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? \nNICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone. \nNICK Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in. (starts off) We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip? \nSAL (panicked) Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be -- \nNICK It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary. \nSAL Phantom Mary? \nNICK Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary? \nSAL (laughs) No. \nNICK (starts off again) Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story? \nSAL (enthusiastically) Yeah! \nNICK Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - U.S. ARMY AIRFIELD - TEXAS - DAY \nThe place is a madhouse of activity. As jets scream overhead TROOPS embarking for Saigon are being counted and recounted. SERGEANTS are yelling off names. CLERKS are typing forms and papers. Forklift trucks weave in and out, DRIVERS cursing. \nNICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by, arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard and moves into the CROWD. \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY \nNICK spots a lone SECOND LIEUTENANT sitting on his gear. More OFFICERS are waiting nearby but the SECOND LIEUTENANT seems not to know them. \nNICK moves in close enough to read the SECOND LIEUTENANT's name tag. \nNICK (bawling) Biederman! Where's Biederman! \nLIEUTENANT Here. \nNICK You Biederman? \nLIEUTENANT Biederman, yes. \nMP Right this way, Lieutenant. \nNICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the door. \nSECOND MP Quick as you can, sir. We're in a rush. \nNICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door, jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing. \nINT. LIMOUSINE - SAIGON - NIGHT \nThere are jeeps with MP's ahead; there are jeeps with MP's behind. Seated beside NICK is a gigantic MARINE CORPORAL who stares rigidly ahead. \nEXT. CAVALCADE - SAIGON - NIGHT \nPedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes screaming down a wide boulevard. \nEXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - SAIGON - NIGHT \nThe jeeps peel off to the side. The gate swings open and the limousine enters the compound. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT \nA STRING QUARTET is playing. GUESTS in evening clothes are drinking champagne. \nNICK enters with the MARINE CORPORAL and is whisked rapidly down a hallway. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nNICK stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table. On the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a pile of mushrooms. Across from the table six SERVANTS with napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates. \nMARINE (V.O.) Sir? \nNICK turns. The MARINE CORPORAL is holding a chef's hat. NICK takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. Suddenly a door comes open and the AMERICAN AMBASSADOR and his WIFE come in. \nAMBASSADOR Henri! So good to see you. How are you? How are you? Darling, this is Henri. Henri, my wife Elizabeth. \nWIFE My pleasure. \nAMBASSADOR Henri, we are starved. Six omelettes, s'il vous plait. \nWIFE (hissing) Avec champignons. \nAMBASSADOR Avec champignons. (back to his WIFE) Fines herbes? \nThe WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks. \nAMBASSADOR (CONT'D) Avec champignons. \nThe AMBASSADOR and his WIFE hurry out. There is dead silence. NICK pulls the MARINE CORPORAL to one side, points to his crotch. \nNICK Pee-pee. \nINT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT \nNICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head. The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud. \nNICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels, removes his pistol and jams it in his belt. \nEXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT \nThree MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open iron gate. As NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to attention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by outside. \nEXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nNICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card that he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets it ring a long time but there is no answer. \nEXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT \nNICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing the yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND. \nEXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low buzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses and lights it. \nThe yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet cushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the CORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe with maggots. \nNICK straightens, looks around. \nNICK Merle!!! \nThe back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol and goes in. \nINT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT \n", "test1_input": "The Deer Hunter \nEXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY \nThe plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted by the falling snow. \nIn the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional aid from a leaning pole. \nMUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as we watch a car come charging up through the slush on Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears, huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY STREET. \nMAIN TITLE COMES UP: \nTHE DEER HUNTER \nINT. STEEL MILL - DAY \nA white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and another and another and another. The ingots are huge, trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying rumble. \nCREDITS ROLL \nUNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are NICK, SAL and MERLE. \nCREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL. SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips, gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track again and they all grab their tongs. \nINT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY \nA very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of nerves. \nSAL'S MOTHER It's all ready? Everything's ready? \nPRIEST Yes. \nSAL'S MOTHER Are you sure everything's ready? Are you positive? \nPRIEST Everything. Yes. \nSAL'S MOTHER It would snow... Everything's going to slip. Everything's going to slide... All the cars are going to crash! \nSAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into tears. \nSAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D) I can't believe this... My own little boy... with a stranger! \nThe PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and comforts her. \nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY \nAnother car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin scampering across the street. They have all been working on their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As they make their way to the other side of the street they all wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS disappear inside. \nCAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats. They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow, with the great white cake held firmly between them. \nINT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY \nThe time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin checking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather together along the wall. \nNICK Where's Vince? \nSAL There's Albert! (calls) Hey, Albert!!! \nALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox -- changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound STEELWORKERS. \nALBERT How you feelin', Sal? \nSAL I feel okay. \nALBERT Feeling hot? \nNICK (arm around SAL) Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell! \nMERLE There's Vince! \nOTHERS (calling) Vince!... Over here! Vince! \nMERLE Get him, Albert. Get Vince! \nALBERT I'll get him. \nALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs VINCE and they all push out together. \nEXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers the acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all stop dead in their tracks. \nVINCE Snow... Holy shit, snow! \n", "test1_true": "VINCE (CONT'D) ... Do you know what this means? Do you guys realize exactly what this means? \nThey all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK exchange looks. ALBERT chortles. \nSAL What are you guys...? Are you guys going hunting? \nThe others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a little embarrassed. \nSAL (CONT'D) Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight? \nNICK As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched. \nSAL (envious) You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts. \nVINCE He's getting married... and we're nuts! \nNICK (puts his arm around SAL) It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you. \nA look at the others... \nNICK (CONT'D) Won't we? Right? Am I right? \nMERLE Right. \nALBERT Damn right! \nVINCE What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this? \nNow SAL is embarrassed. He makes a gesture with his hand. \nNICK (with a laugh) C'mon. C'mon you guys! \nThey all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm around SAL. \nVINCE And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need-- \nALBERT Yeah, Sal-- \nMERLE Willing fingers-- \nALBERT Extra feet! \nINT. V.F.W. POST - DAY \nThe place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are laying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side a half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper ribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders, two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under the direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by side. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind corrective lenses. \nVET 1 Up I would say... What would you say? \nVET 2 Up. \nVET 1 (signals) Up ribbon! \nOne end of the ribbon is moved up. The two VETS study it. \nVET 2 Down I would say... What would you say? \nVET 1 Down. \nVET 2 (signals) Down ribbon! \nSuddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up the tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in with the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs. \nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY \nA big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches, coming fast. \nINT. CADILLAC - DAY \nNICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is at the wheel. \nVINCE Hit it, Nick! \nOTHERS Go Nick! Hit it, baby!!! \nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY \nThe car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We watch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three quarter mark... \nINT. CADILLAC - DAY \nNICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the slapping wipers. \n", "test1_id": 882, "test2_input": "WE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL, FLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER... \nEXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY \nThere are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the tops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat clusters, like eggs. \nSuddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets. \nEXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY \nAs the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot upward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two miles wide. \nEXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY \nA platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts spilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute silence except for the low buzz of flies. \nA V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque command and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS -- idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke. \nThere is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives a low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts. He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts toward them. \nINT. GRASS HUT - DAY \nSouth Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their hands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a look of stark terror in their faces. \nEXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY \nOne of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE SOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a gash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly gaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE. \nA WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot rings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and stands there, on all fours, like a dog. \nEXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY \nThe V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the end of his bayonet. \nEXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY \nMERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts for the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike, and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the dead. \nEXT. GRASS HUTS DAY \nThe VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air squats nearby and yawns. \nEXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY \nMERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat package and draws back. \nCAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming things, glittering blankly. \nEXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY \nMERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C. SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a thin mist of spraying blood. \nABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR. \nEXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY \nThere are five of them, coming in low under the tops of nearby trees. \nEXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY \nThe VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm. \nEXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY \nMERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet. \nIn front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are motionless now, like two roasted stones. \nAn AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine. \nLIEUTENANT What the hell are you doing here? \nMERLE (numb) Saving lives. \nMORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL. \nLIEUTENANT Move it out, girls! Move it out! \nThe LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE. \nNICK Merle?... Jesus, Merle! \nMERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He seems to be looking right through him. \n", "test2_true": "SAL Hey...! Hey, Merle! \nA shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire. Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for cover. \nOut of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores. \nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY \nWe are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by stones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo gratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men -- SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings and their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan there is only the sound of the falling rain. \nA V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and down on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as one comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with laughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls down his pants and squats above the center grating. \nCAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its totality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and contains only two structures. One is a large bamboo \"tiger cage\" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small hut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and we can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside. \nA cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt on flesh and the cry abruptly stops. \nINT. THATCHED HUT - DAY \nIn the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a rose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are two chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the chairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the half-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the middle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE, is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American eagle carved on its ivory grip. \nMERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking in every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH VIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber. Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser, and it takes some time to straighten things out. \nMERLE looks off to his right: \nINT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY \nWe see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing against the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all have their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them, standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks grey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing quietly. \nINT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY \nThe betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the .45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the revolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down from the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and grin. \nMERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table from him begins shaking uncontrollably. \nThe V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table between MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good spin. \nThe revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at MERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with a loud CLICK. \nMERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it toward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to tremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get the gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer and puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger. There is a loud CLICK. \nMERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is another CLICK. \nMERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the SOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on the trigger. \nTHERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN TABLE. \nMERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and MERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement... like a cat. \nEXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY \nA pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The bodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads are all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are already feeding on them. \nINT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY \nNICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for a long time. \nNICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS murmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table. \nINT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY \nThere are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing has stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose. MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to SAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the room and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting choice survives another round. \nMERLE You can do it, Sal. \nSAL No. No, no. \nMERLE Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it. \nSAL I want to go home, Merle. \nMERLE You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this. \nSAL (tears again) This is horrible! \nMERLE Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand? \nSAL (nods) Merle, I wanna go home! \nThere is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor. \nMERLE Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have to do it! \n", "test2_id": 883, "test3_input": "REFEREE (amplified) Game number seven.

Forfeit automatic after delay of one minute. \nThe REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L. \nREFEREE Gentleman on the left will now commence play. \nThe REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the cylinder, cocks it and \nplaces it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger... and clicks out. \nNICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A. SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... \nNICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor. \nThe FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DANCES AROUND. \nNICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory. He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in five languages. \nNICK starts off again, hurrying. \nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT \nNICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing, squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS. Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE, several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS. \nSuddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins. TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS in it. \nARMAND (V.O.) If you are brave and lucky I can make you rich. \nNICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him for a fraction of a second and then smiles. \nARMAND (CONT'D) C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play? \nNICK I came to see Merle. \nARMAND Ah. Merle. And you know Merle? \nNICK Yeah. \nARMAND (studies him) You are his friend. \nNICK Where is he??? \nARMAND (faint smile) Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him. \nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT \nGUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering like birds. \nLaughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny lanterns bob and sway. \nNICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops. \nMERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone, dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops, or snow flakes, or falling stones. \nNICK (shouts) Merle! \nMERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When NICK reaches the table, he stands. \nNICK (CONT'D) Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you? \nMERLE Nick!... I thought you went home. \nNICK I did. I... This is stolen. I came back. \nMERLE Sit down. \nNICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't know where to start. \nMERLE (CONT'D) (breaking the silence) How's Linda? \nNICK Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing? \nMERLE (eyes him) I like it, Nick. \nNICK Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... (stares at him) Why? \nFor a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if to some landscape far beyond. \nMERLE I like it because it's simple. \n", "test3_true": "MERLE (CONT'D) (stands) I have to go, Nick. We'll have a drink. \nMERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD. \nNICK Merle...! Merle, wait! \nNICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES. \nNICK (CONT'D) Merle!!! \nNICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around to the terrace. \nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT \nNICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace. \nNICK Excuse me... Sorry... Sorry... Pardon. \nNICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared. \nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT \nNICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted. \nREFEREE (V.O.) Gentleman on the right will now commence play. \nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE SOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK INTO EMPTY CHAMBERS. \nSuddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts toward the entrance to the bleachers. \nA SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he runs. \nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT \nNICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers. The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes through a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned relief spreads over his features. \nOn the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight, head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION. \nNICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with everyone else. \nOn the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists in the air and begins hooting maniacally. \n... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE SPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT. \nINT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY \nPipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of leaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their uniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE OTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient attention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with a bugle, trying to play TAPS. \nVET 1 Up a little there... What would you say? \nVET 2 Up. \nThe VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts over... \nINT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY \nThree tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The tables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a funeral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the placement of each knife and fork. \nAS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS THE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS BARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET WITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW. BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS WATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE. \nGradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the table. They stand motionless, listening. \nEXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY \nA HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and grey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a ghostly cloud of white exhaust. \nTHE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK TRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE. \nIn the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the church swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with MERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear the COFFIN slowly down the steps. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nSnow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn headstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and groans. \nEXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY \nThe PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The MOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER. \nCAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help SAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets stuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful of dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in. \n", "test3_id": 884}

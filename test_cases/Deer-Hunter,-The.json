{"test1_input": "GENERAL (CONT'D) (as they take off) Y'know, there's more fucking maniacs coming out of this conflict... \nMERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below the REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands. \nEXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY \nMERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS, HOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a speck in the vast human torrent. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY \nThe room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby hydraulic mechanism. \nEXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY \nBlack BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot concrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE PFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets into the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT. \nINT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY \nNICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair. Suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in. \nDOCTOR Is your name Solomon? \nNICK shakes his head. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Are you sure? \nNICK nods. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Lemme see this. \nThe DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Is this yours? \nNICK nods. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) This isn't yours. This can't be yours! I'm going to take this one off and cut it up... (he extracts a pair of scissors and does so) Shred it... so no one gets a hold of it. What I'm going to do now, I'm going to give you this one. (he staples a new marker around NICK's neck) There. How's that? Does that feel better? \nNICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) That one's yours. \nThe DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek and whine... \nNICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently, then closes his wallet and puts it away. \nINT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY \nBanks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is playing. \nNICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again, peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back. NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone -- and then he stops, frozen with fear. \nGUM CHEWER BEHIND Go on, babe. Take it. 'S all yours! \nNICK (mumbles) You go ahead. \nCAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS. \nEXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY \nNICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his eye. \nNICK (calling) Sal...! Sal!!! \nNICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even looking. \nVehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close. \nNICK (CONT'D) Sorry... Thought you were someone else. \nThe SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a long swallow. \nINT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT \nThe place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene contortions. \nNICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention. \nNICK I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say. \nBAR GIRL Everybody love Linda. \n", "test1_true": "BAR GIRL I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! \nNICK Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda -- \nBAR GIRL (in his ear) How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda? \nNICK (stares at her) You mean...? \nBAR GIRL I show you. Come. You come. (pulls him to his feet) Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right? \nNICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry. \nBAR GIRL (CONT'D) I give you special, crazy fuck, just like Linda. Come. You come. Linda cry, make crazy moan? \nNICK nods. \nBAR GIRL (CONT'D) I give you cry, crazy moan. Come. You come. \nINT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT \nThe BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him to a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his waist and the other down the front of his pants. \nBAR GIRL You like to call me Linda now? \nNICK Linda, yeah. \nBAR GIRL You call me Linda, just like home. \nSuddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR GIRL and pushes up against the glass. \nEXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT \nSeated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite building is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white ceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him. Motorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both directions. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of some timeless, silent kingdom. \nINT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT \nNICK spins away from the window. \nNICK Hey... Hey, elephants! Look at those elephants! \nThe BAR GIRL stares at him. \nNICK (CONT'D) Linda loves elephants! Linda... she loves 'em! \nNICK turns and charges back down the corridor with the BAR GIRL hot on his tail. \nBAR GIRL Wait! First I give you special fuck! \nNICK Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants! \nEXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT \nNICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his ceramic elephants. \nNICK Great... These are great. I wanna tell you these are great elephants! I'm going home, see... Stateside in a few days and my wife Linda, she loves elephants. She... she has a thing for elephants because elephants... Elephants go on. You know what I mean? They go right on. I don't know if they cry. Maybe at night. I mean... What I mean is my two best buddies are dead, see, MIA, who knows, and they would have liked some elephants also because... How much are these elephants? I mean let's talk elephant. (notices a GROUP OF STREET URCHINS) Hey you guys...! Over here! Come over here and carry elephants! \nThe STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged, malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are covered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another has lost a hand. \nNICK (CONT'D) Everyone take an elephant! (to the YOUNGEST URCHIN) You know how to carry an elephant? (the URCHIN nods) That's what I thought. Right off I figured you as that kind of guy. Hey, wait a minute, I gotta get change. Take an elephant! Everyone take an elephant and then form up. Right here. Over here, like this, in a nice long elephant line... Good. That's good. Man, look at all these elephants! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... eleven elephants! (surveys them) Hey, but you gotta stand tall to carry elephants. (he illustrates) Better. That's better. I mean... God damn, I mean that's elephants now! Wait. Now you wait while I get change. \nNICK dives into a nearby bar. \nINT. NEARBY BAR - NIGHT \nThe place is as dark as the one before. MUSIC BLASTS from a jukebox and two vaseline-covered GIRLS are dancing. As NICK crosses to the bar to get change there is a WHISTLING SCREAM and then the FRONT WALL OF THE BUILDING DISINTEGRATES IN A ROAR OF NOISE. \nNICK pulls himself out of the debris. There is absolute silence in the WRECKED BAR but rockets are coming in all over the city and the EXPLOSIONS rumble and roar. \nEXT. NARROW STREET AFTER ROCKET EXPLOSION - NIGHT \nA nearby building is burning fiercely. The street is deserted except for the sprawled CORPSES of the STREET URCHINS which lie this way and that, like broken dolls. \nNICK walks out past the CORPSES. The street is littered with fragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like chunks of snow. \nEXT. DESERTED STREET - SAIGON - NIGHT \nThe sky is alight with fires. Now and then HUGE EXPLOSIONS rock the night and SIRENS wail. \nA lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street. As the figure approaches we see that it is NICK. \nNICK (toneless, over and over) Hey, hey, the wind does blow. Hey, hey, the snow does snow. Hey, hey, the rain does rain... \n", "test1_id": 882, "test2_input": "The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black speck in the endless expanse of shifting white. \nAs NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in the driving snow. \nThe wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock. \nNICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty feet away, looking down at him. \nNICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights down the barrel. \nWE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT. NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT. \nNICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW. \nNICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE HAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE. \nNICK (grins) Damn... God damn... \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY \nNICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock face. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it might be something from a dream. \nNICK (shouts) Hey! Hey... okay! \nINT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT \nThe Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the wind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out cold. ALBERT and VINCE are both drunk and arguing bitterly. \nALBERT You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away! \nVINCE Who? Who is? \nALBERT You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know? \nVINCE I know! I fuckin' know! \nALBERT You don't! \nVINCE I do!!! \nALBERT I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know! \nVINCE She does not! \nALBERT Then what's the gun for! What's this for? \nVINCE In case!!! The gun's in case!!! \nALBERT In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?! \nVINCE She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!! \nALBERT She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!! \nVINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and cocks it. \nVINCE (shrieking) Say that one more time!... Say it!!! Go on, say it!!! \nNICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up. NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches over, pulls NICK away. \nALBERT Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way. \nNICK (grimly) Yeah. \nVINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face. \nVINCE What the hell was that! (picks up the pistol) What did you think? Did you think it was loaded! \nNICK You loaded it, Vince! I saw you! \nVINCE The fuck I did!!! \nNICK The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that! \nNICK takes the pistol. \nVINCE What do you think? You think I don't know!!! \nNICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR. \nFor a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore. \nNICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands... \n", "test2_true": "NICK goes out. \nEXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT \nFor a moment NICK stands in the light from the door, listening to the wind. He looks down at the pistol again, then he heaves it into the trees. \nThe wind gusts. The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through the woods in great streaming wraiths. \nNICK watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in. \nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK \nThe trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls into the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK gets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and pounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb with his load of THREE DEAD DEER. \nNICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside. \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT \nTWO DOZEN AMPUTEES in wheelchairs are watching a western. \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the foreground a NURSE holds a telephone. Beyond the NURSE we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down the polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize it is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and trails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been amputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his eyes. \nSAL takes the telephone. THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE MOVIE IN THE RECREATION ROOM IS VERY LOUD. \nSAL Hello? \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nNICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver. \nNICK Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick. \nSAL Nick. Hey. How's things? \nNICK Oh. You know. How's it with you? \nSAL Same. Hey. Same old stuff. \nNICK (he can hardly hear) What's that noise? \nSAL What? \nNICK What's that noise? \nSAL John Wayne... Listen, Nick -- \nNICK Great. Hey. That's great. \nSAL Listen, Nick -- \nNICK John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out? \nSAL I'm gonna stay here, Nick. \nNICK (hearing it) What? \nSAL (with everything he has) Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean -- \nNICK Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly -- \nSAL I gotta get back, Nick. \nSAL looks around in desperation. \nSAL (CONT'D) They're passing out popcorn now, so I'll be talking to you... maybe next year. \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nNICK holds the receiver, staring into it. There is the SOUND OF WHOOPING, GRUNTING, THUNDERING HOOVES... \nNICK Sal?... Sal? \nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT \nSAL is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor. At the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back at the DANGLING RECEIVER. Then he turns and disappears into the flickering darkness, where BUGLES are sounding a cavalry charge. \nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nNICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then puts the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks around in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye falls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns, hurries out the door. \n", "test2_id": 883, "test3_input": "NICK (CONT'D) Shit! \nNICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment. \nSAL Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I mean, if it's socks or something just let 'em go. \nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY \nNICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere. \nSAL (V.O.) Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now. \nNICK It's not socks, Sal. \nNICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the bundles of bills. \nThe paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket for a long time. \nNICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and unfolds it. \nTHE CARD READS \"EXHIBITIONS\". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON. \nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY \nNICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying. \nSAL Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't understand. \nNICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself back with effort. \nNICK It's Merle, Sal. \nSAL Merle? ... Merle's alive? (NICK nods) How do you know? \nNICK I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind. \nSAL Merle gave me this? \nNICK Yeah. \nSAL But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? \nNICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone. \nNICK Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in. (starts off) We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip? \nSAL (panicked) Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be -- \nNICK It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary. \nSAL Phantom Mary? \nNICK Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary? \nSAL (laughs) No. \nNICK (starts off again) Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story? \nSAL (enthusiastically) Yeah! \nNICK Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - U.S. ARMY AIRFIELD - TEXAS - DAY \nThe place is a madhouse of activity. As jets scream overhead TROOPS embarking for Saigon are being counted and recounted. SERGEANTS are yelling off names. CLERKS are typing forms and papers. Forklift trucks weave in and out, DRIVERS cursing. \nNICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by, arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard and moves into the CROWD. \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY \nNICK spots a lone SECOND LIEUTENANT sitting on his gear. More OFFICERS are waiting nearby but the SECOND LIEUTENANT seems not to know them. \nNICK moves in close enough to read the SECOND LIEUTENANT's name tag. \nNICK (bawling) Biederman! Where's Biederman! \nLIEUTENANT Here. \nNICK You Biederman? \nLIEUTENANT Biederman, yes. \n", "test3_true": "BIEDERMAN Correct. \nNICK Follow me, please. \nINT.

TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY \nNICK comes to a door, opens it. \nNICK Through here. \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY \nThe LIEUTENANT walks into the closet and comes to a stop, looking puzzled. NICK comes in behind him, closes the door and picks up a length of pipe. \nNICK Take off the uniform. \nThe LIEUTENANT stares at NICK, dumbfounded. \nNICK (CONT'D) Take off the uniform, Lieutenant! \nThe LIEUTENANT nods, begins taking off his uniform. \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY \nNICK has changed into the LIEUTENANT's uniform and tied him to a chair. The LIEUTENANT is in tears. NICK is going through his orders. \nLIEUTENANT Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important. \nNICK (exasperated) Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important. \nLIEUTENANT That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret. \nNICK Biederman! \nLIEUTENANT (stiffly) I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver! \nNICK throws down the pipe in disgust, whips a gag around the LIEUTENANT's mouth and ties it. \nNICK When I get to Saigon I'll tell 'em where you are. \nSlams the door. \nEXT. SAIGON AIRPORT - TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT \nViet Cong SAPPERS have just attacked. A number of jet fighters are burning, bodies are strewn over the tarmac and jeeps with SOLDIERS are racing back and forth. Out beyond, the jet transport taxis into view, lumbering like a great silver monster out of the night. \nINT. JET TRANSPORT - NIGHT \nNICK stands in the aisle next to a COLONEL who is peering out the window. \nCOLONEL Jesus Christ, they hit the airport! \nNICK nods. \nCOLONEL (CONT'D) Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em? \nNICK Naw. \nCOLONEL (leans close) Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart. \nNICK nods. EVERYONE starts out. \nCOLONEL (CONT'D) Lotta guys don't know that. (winks) Assholes! \nEXT. JET TRANSPORT - DEBARKATION RAMP - NIGHT \nA SIREN is screaming in the distance. NICK looks around nervously. The COLONEL is still right in beside him. \nCOLONEL Tell you something else. Don't eat 'em in the damn Delta. Unless you like 'em fishy... Some do. I don't. I never did. \nThe scream of the SIREN grows louder. Suddenly a Jeep careens around the corner followed by a huge black Cadillac flying American flags on the fenders. Both vehicles screech to a stop and an MP jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer. \nMP (amplified) Lieutenant Biederman! Lieutenant Biederman report to the ramp! \nCOLONEL That's you.

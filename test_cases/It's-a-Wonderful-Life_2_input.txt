ED But, George, I got my money here. 
CHARLIE Did he guarantee this place? 
GEORGE Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.  We don't need Potter over here. 
Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene. Mary stands watching silently. 
CHARLIE I'll take mine now. 
GEORGE No, but you... you... you're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's house... (to one of the men) ...right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do? Foreclose on them? 
TOM I got two hundred and forty-two dollars in here, and two hundred and forty-two dollars isn't going to break anybody. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  ANOTHER ANGLE 
GEORGE (handing him a slip) Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. You sign this. You'll get your money in sixty days. 
TOM Sixty days? 
GEORGE Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares. 
There is a commotion at the outer doors. A man (Randall) comes in and makes his way up to Tom. 
RANDALL Tom... Tom, did you get your money? 
TOM No. 
RANDALL Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got. (shows bills) 
CROWD (ad lib) Fifty cents on the dollar! 
RANDALL Yes, cash! 
TOM (to George) Well, what do you say? 
GEORGE Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement. Now give us sixty days on this. 
TOM (turning to Randall) Okay, Randall. 
He starts out. 
MRS. THOMPSON Are you going to go to Potter's? 
TOM Better to get half than nothing. 
A few other people start for the door.  CAMERA PANS WITH George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. 
GEORGE Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank.  He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us.  Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.  And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. 
The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. 
GEORGE Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? (to Ed) Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? (turns to address the room again) Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not.  That's why. He's picking up some bargains.  Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other. 
MRS. THOMPSON But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money. 
WOMAN How am I going to live until the bank opens? 
MAN I got doctor bills to pay. 
MAN I need cash. 
MAN Can't feed my kids on faith. 
During this scene Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out 
MARY How much do you need? 
George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. 
GEORGE Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here's two thousand dollars. This'll tide us over until the bank reopen. (to Tom) All right, Tom, how much do you need? 
TOM (doggedly) Two hundred and forty-two dollars! 
GEORGE (pleading) Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till the bank reopens. 
TOM I'll take two hundred and forty-two dollars. 
George starts rapidly to count out the money. Tom throws his passbook on the counter. 
GEORGE There you are. 
TOM That'll close my account. 
GEORGE Your account's still here. That's a loan. 
Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, and speaks to Ed, the next in line. 
GEORGE Okay. All right, Ed? 
ED I got three hundred dollars here, George. 
Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. 
GEORGE Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till the bank reopens? What do you need? 
ED Well, I suppose twenty dollars. 
GEORGE Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. Fine.  Thanks, Ed. (to Mrs. Thompson, next in line) All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want? 
MRS. THOMPSON But it's your own money, George. 
GEORGE Never mind about that. How much do you want? 
MRS. THOMPSON I can get along with twenty, all right. 
GEORGE (counting it out) Twenty dollars. 
MRS. THOMPSON And I'll sign a paper. 
GEORGE You don't have to sign anything. I know you'll pay it back when you can. That's okay. (to woman next in line) All right, Mrs. Davis. 
MRS. DAVIS Could I have seventeen-fifty? 
GEORGE Seven... (he kisses her) Bless your heart, Of course you can have it. You got fifty cents? (counting) Seven... 
WIPE TO: 
INT. OUTER OFFICE BUILDING AND LOAN  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
George, Uncle Billy and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the door. 
UNCLE BILLY (excitedly) We're going to make it, George. They'll never close us up today! 
GEORGE (counting) Six... five... four... three... two... one... Bingo! 
Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door, and scurries around the counter to join the others.

She doesn't turn back, heading down the road. 
TRANSITION TO: 
EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY 
Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle, who's getting tired of her coloring book. 
Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request. 
MARY Okay, but you have to be careful, understand? You have to use Big Girl hands. 
Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle has some trouble folding out the little screen, but eventually gets it open without any help from her mom. 
MARY (CONT'D) Do you want to see where we were today? 
Noelle nods. 
Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips past. 
MARY (CONT'D) Okay, now hit play. This button. 
Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her father eating lunch by a waterfall. (Mary is filming.) 
MARY (CONT'D) There's you. And there's Daddy. You're a little movie star, huh? 
Noelle smiles.   Signs something. 
MARY (CONT'D) He'll be back soon. Don't you worry. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY 
Gabriel continues walking, headed back in the direction he came. From behind him... 
SIERRA (O.S.) Hey! 
He turns, finding her a ways back.   She approaches. 
GABRIEL Were you following me? 
SIERRA Once I was sure you weren't following me. I'm sorry, it's just... 
GABRIEL You thought I was Ted Bundy. 
SIERRA Kinda. 
GABRIEL My name's Gabriel.   Bundy. 
She smiles. 
SIERRA Sierra. 
They shake. 
SIERRA (CONT'D) Weird that there's no cars.    At all. 
GABRIEL Yeah. 
SIERRA So, listen. I'm parked that way. 
She points off the road, through the forest. 
SIERRA (CONT'D) It's not that far. If you want, I'll give you a ride to town. 
GABRIEL Really? 
SIERRA Yeah.   Make up some karma. 
GABRIEL Lead the way. 
She does. They cross off the pavement, descending into a dark forest.

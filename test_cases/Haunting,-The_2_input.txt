LUKE He's trying to protect the experiment.  Personally, I don't think he's got a large enough sample for valid results, but as long as the money's good, and the food is good, I'm in. 
He heads off.  Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal heads on the stairs.  Theo touches her.  She starts. 
THEO Nell, it was an accident. 
INT. MARROW'S BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT 
Marrow, sitting at a desk, speaks into a digital voice recorder. His voice is cold, analytical. 
MARROW Icebreaker exercise conducted over dinner.  Observed initial bonding among subjects and experimenter. After dinner first bland history of House relayed.  Nell appears most susceptible to suggestive history.  Luke, who tested at the bottom of the Levy-Mogel Confidence Reliability Scale was given the second part of the story.  We should see some results tomorrow.  Accident with harp, while unfortunate... complements the experimental fiction. 
He turns off the machine, and then he says, ruefully: 
MARROW (cont'd) Publish or perish. 
He turns off the light.  The shadows in the room are too much for him. He turns the light on, and then pulls the blanket over his head. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Nell finishes putting things away in drawers.  Theo watches, leaning in the doorway.  Nell looks around at the room: and this is her new family's new home.  Theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  An awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away. 
THEO Ever try putting your hair up in a French twist? 
Theo reaches for Nell's hair.  Nell pulls away.  Theo pauses.  Nell realizes she shouldn't have pulled back. 
NELL Sorry.  I'm not used to being touched. 
She moves closer to let Theo examine her hair.  Theo takes Nell's hair, holds it up in a French twist. 
THEO You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? 
NELL Yes.  I've missed it. 
THEO No.  The world has missed you. 
Cautiously, Nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she sees.  Theo lets Nell's hair drop.  Theo moves for the door. 
NELL Good night, Theo. 
THEO You, too.  Happy tossing and turning. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
As Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing, the CAMERA finds the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but staring OC where we sense Nell changing. 
Now in a long tee-shirt, Nell crawls up onto the high bed.  Its headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe plants. 
She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard. 
Something about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it. She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her breathing -- 
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 
-- then almost silence.  We pull back from the CHILDREN'S FACES on the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in darkness.  Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  But now, at the very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if SOMETHING EXHALES. 
INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
It is black at the top of the stairs.  The carved animal heads on the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear. Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness. 
INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT 
Eyes.  Eyes of all the mythological figures.  STARING down the long, black hallway.  Awaiting something.  Afraid. 
At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut. 
That something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES.  Rises as if the House itself is breathing. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
BUMP.  The sound thuds the stillness of the House.  Bump.  Bump. Bump.  Deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  Nell sits up, still asleep, body moving by reflex. 
NELL Coming, Mother! 
WHUMP.  The noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, VERY REAL.  Nell remembers where she is. 
Bump bang.  It's coming from somewhere far off in the House.  Nell listens in cold dread. 
THEO (OC) Nell! 
Nell spins to the bathroom door, goes through -- 
INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
-- the unlit bathroom, slamming the door to her room behind her, across and out the other door -- 
INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
-- into Theo's room.  THUMP BUMP BUMP.  Nell finds Theo right in front of her, hair wet, kneeling in the bed, clutching her covers to herself.

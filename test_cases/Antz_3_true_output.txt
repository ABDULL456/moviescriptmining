FORMICA Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner! 
Z Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush. 
FORMICA (reflective moment) Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant. (he looks out at his army) And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed. 
Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in confusion. 
Z (clapping) Bravo!  Bring on the Princess! 
COLONEL Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's move 'em out! 
The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past the reviewing stand. 
A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around for the Princess. 
COLONEL Eyes...left! 
Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave. 
Z (waving) Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's me!  Z!  I've got your scarf! 
ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching by... 
BALA (peering out) Who is that idiot? 
QUEEN Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave! 
Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her hand back and forth on her wrist. 
Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him. 
Z (excited) Excuse me, guys -- That's my date. Well, it's been fun.  Have a great war! 
Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're carrying him along with them. 
Z Hey!  Wait! 
Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away. BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps Z on the shoulder. 
BARBATUS You new, kid? 
Z I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership! 
BARBATUS Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch. 
At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the OPEN AIR outside of the colony. 
EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT 
It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march... 
Z Wait a minute, there's been a mistake!  I've got to get back to the colony! 
Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking concerned, stops him.

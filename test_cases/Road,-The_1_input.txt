(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: They descend the rough wooden steps. 
INT. CELLAR/STATELY HOME - DAY 
There is a terrible stench and they have to cover their mouths and noses with their parkas. The MAN gets out his lighter, lights it and tries to light the way. POV MAN - BLACKNESS except the small area illuminated by the lighter as the MAN searches: part of a stone wall; then a clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains. The glow of the flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the MAN steps closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to 
REVEAL: Huddled against the wall, all trying to hide, shielding their shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN, thin as skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps, shocked and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by: On a mattress on the floor lies a NAKED MAN with his legs gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned, cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes. 
MAN. Jesus... The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them and WHISPERS, a low indistinct murmur at first. 
MAN ON MATTRESS. Help us... please help us... 
MAN. Christ... oh Christ... The others join in, an eerie chorus of WHISPERING, "Help us... please help us..." The MAN turns and grabs the BOY and rushes for the steps. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Hurry... go... move! The MAN drops the lighter as he tries to push the BOY up the steps. Out of nowhere a BEARDED FACE appears at the foot of the stairs, blinking. 
BEARDED FACE. Please... they're taking us to the smoke house. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The BEARDED FACE reaches out and feebly tries to grab the MAN's arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the BOY up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and missing his footing. 
MAN. Hurry - hurry! They scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as the BEARDED FACE reaches out and tries one last time to grab at the MAN's feet but he kicks free. 
INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY 
The MAN scrambles out, slams the door shut and drags a solid table over the door. He looks around for the BOY. 
MAN. Christ. Run! The BOY is near the window, dancing up and down in terror, pointing out the window to: 
EXT. FIELDS - DAY 
Coming up the path toward the house are four BEARDED MEN and two WOMEN, all suspiciously well fed and healthy-looking. One of the MEN holds hands with one of the WOMEN, as if they were returning from a stroll before dinner. 
INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY 
The MAN stares a moment, frozen with horror, then grabs the BOY by the hand and jerks him away. 
MAN. Run. Run! 
INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY 
They tear through to the front door, the MAN fumbles to get it open but it has a well-maintained deadlock on it. He stares out the window next to the door and sees: POV MAN - The WELL-FED PEOPLE are climbing the steps of the porch. The MAN Grabs the BOY and they rush through into kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY 
In the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and the table elevating inches. They rush back out again. 
INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY 
As they reach the stairs, a key turns in the lock and the MAN picks up the BOY in his arms and they sprint to a door under the stairs. As they get through the door the front door swings open and the WELL-FED PEOPLE drift inside. 
INT. REST ROOM - DAY 
They are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet and a basin. The BOY's face is level with the basin and while the MAN is holding the door shut the BOY comes face to face with the contents of the basin: POV BOY - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and tallow in the basin. Around the basin are bloody red hand prints on the white porcelain. POV MAN - through a thin crack he sees the WELL-FED PEOPLE on the far side of the foyer, chatting casually. He is not close enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see that the MEN's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired clothes. 
WELL FED WOMAN. I'm going to freshen up. 
BEARDED MAN. I need a drink. 
WELL FED WOMAN 2. I'm going up to change. He hears one of the WOMEN STOMPING across the old floorboards and up the stairs to change while the other WOMAN takes a few steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the window as the conversation lurches on. 
BEARDED MAN 2. Who left this window open? 
WELL FED WOMAN. I leave it open for the smell. 
BEARDED MAN 2. What smell? 
WELL FED WOMAN. You don't smell it anymore? 
BEARDED MAN. Who wants a drink?

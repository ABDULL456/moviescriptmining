PIKUL 
(QUIETLY) But Allegra. What if we're not in the game anymore? 
GELLER (confused, childlike) Huh? If... if we... we're not? 
PIKUL 
(STRANGELY HARD) If we're not, then you just killed someone real. A real person. 
(PAUSE) You see what can happen. It's important for me that you see that. 
GELLER Why? 
PIKUL (standing over her) It wasn't an accident that you and I ended up on the run together. 
GELLER Not an accident? Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands. 
PIKUL No. 
GELLER 
(COLD) That's why you never had a bioport. You were one of them. 
PIKUL I still am one of them. 
GELLER But you have a bioport now. 
(IRONIC) I thought that was forbidden to Anti-eXistenZialists. 
PIKUL I made the bioport sacrifice to get close to you, to make love to my enemy. 
GELLER Why would you do that? 
PIKUL To understand what I have to kill. 
GELLER 
(QUIETLY) Then. understand this. Geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the pocket of her shirt. 
GELLER Understand that I suspected who you were from the moment you made that fake phone call to yourself in the limo. Understand that I knew you were my real assassin when you pointed the gun at me in the Chinese restaurant. She flicks up a safety cover on the remote's tip, revealing a toggle switch. Pikul's hands tense around the submachine gun. 
GELLER And understand that you're dead. Geller flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul's spine blows out, his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport explodes. 
A delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers backwards. 
GELLER 
(GLEEFUL) Death to the demon Ted Pikul! His eyes frozen in a death stare, Pikul falls, rolls down the hill into the underbrush. Smoke creeping up from the fires below curls over him like a blanket. Arms raised in the air, Geller dances around on the top of the hill, looking down on the flames and the chaos. 
GELLER (confident, laughing) Have I won the game? Have I won? Have I won? The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her.

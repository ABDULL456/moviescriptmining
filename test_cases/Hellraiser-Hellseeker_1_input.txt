THE TV SCREEN DISSOLVES to Trevor in bed with yet another woman... and another... and another... 
BACK TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
That fatal BELL begins to TOLL. With each peel the walls of the morgue shakes. It's walls begin to rumble and crack. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PINHEAD Even a mind as narcissistic as yours must have wondered: What unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind YOUR back? 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
LOW ANGLE UP AT: Kirsty, Trevor's lovely wife, raising a rock above her. 
KIRSTY (to camera) Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch! 
And SLAMMING a rock down on us. 
bacK TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
TREVOR What's under that sheet...? 
PINHEAD You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife. 
flASH BACK: 
INT. TREVOR'S APT., BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Trevor and a very pregnant Kirsty sit on their bed, passing the cube back and forth. Trevor's the one with the magic touch. The cube begins to open in his hands. Kirsty's eyes light up as she watches... 
PINHEAD (V.O.) It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration. 
ON the walls as shadows begin to flail in pain and panic. OFF SCREEN SCREAMS are heard as blood begins to shower the walls of the bedroom. 
PINHEAD (V.O.) But someone was expecting us Trevor. And everything went according to plan. 
baCK TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
PINHEAD We were about to come for Kirsty. When we were offered a deal. We don't usually consider bargains but this one was too good to pass up. A tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn. The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty. The three souls had already been picked out. Needless to say we were very impressed. 
The lights dim. Drawers behind Pinhead begin to open. We see Gwen's body, Tawny's, Sage's, Bonnie's. 
PINHEAD (CONT'D) Two of your favorite companions, most supple and delicious as you already know. And the man you had at one time conspired to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out she was with child. 
smASH CUT TO: 
QUICK IMAGES of Gwen, Tawny, and Bret being rent to pieces by the Cenobites, SCREAMING in vain. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
PINHEAD (CONT'D) They were all real screamers too. We had a blast. And there was one more. You've seen many things you wished you hadn't. Many nightmares from which you never awoke. They were all clues in our little puzzle. Can you guess now Trevor? Can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement? 
The lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe. Hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out of the cracks in the walls, racing toward Trevor. He doesn't care. 
TREVOR WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PINHEAD (smiling) Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, Trevor. Reality. 
Pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back. 
Trevor's jaw drops in disbelief. 
IT'S TREVOR'S BODY. It is blue, bloated and mutilated. The corpse's skull has a massive crack in it.

ANGLE 
ON DR. FELL, WHO IS WALKING TOWARD HIM. 
FELL Ah, Commendatore... you, too, admire Mozart. 
PAZZI (PAUSE) Who does not? 
FELL If such there breathe, I'm sure you could unearth him... (PAUSE) Your reputation does you honor. (PAUSE) 
PAZZI I've left my program... 
FELL Take mine. (HE HANDS HIS PROGRAM TO PAZZI, AND THEY START UP THE AISLE) Ah. And is that your wife... (THEY GAIN THE SIDE OF MME. PAZZI.) Signora. (HE BENDS TO KISS HER HAND) Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...? 
MRS. PAZZI My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men. 
FELL Then, she, herself, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well... 
PAZZI IS CALLED AWAY, BY AN EXITING OPERAGOER, AND HE LEAVES RELUCTANTLY, LOOKING BACK, WITH APPREHENSION, AT FELL AND HIS WIFE. 
THE TWO, CHATTING, JOIN HIM. 
FELL (cont'd) Commendatore, your wife tells me you are taking her away on Vacation. 
PAZZI ...long overdue. 
FELL (AS THEY EXIT, ONTO THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE OPERA, AND MANY CARS AND LIMOS, PULLING UP TO RECEIVE THE EXITING, ET CETERA.) Back to America...? (PAUSE) (WHILE PAZZI LOOKS ON WITH CONSTERNATION) When first we met you'd just returned from America. 
MRS. PAZZI How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your busy mind... 
FELL ...how so? 
MRS. PAZZI ...you told me you were studying for your examination by the Studiolo... 
FELL And how good of you to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to America... 
MRS. PAZZI No, this is pleasure... 
FELL And what was the trip before...? 
MRS. PAZZI That, that was business... 
PAZZI TRIES TO MANEUVER HIS WIFE AWAY FROM FELL.  CAMERA TAKES THEM AROUND A CORNER, TO A "NO PARKING, LOADING ZONE," SIGN, IN WHICH WE SEE A POLICE SEDAN, AND ONE OF PAZZI'S MEN.  HE IS WEARING THE GIMME HAT PAZZI BROUGHT BACK FROM THE STATES. 
ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS OVER AT THE DRIVER. 
ANGLE HIS POV. 
THE HAT, "FBI INTERNATIONAL POLICE ACADEMY, QUANTICO VIRGINIA." 
THE DRIER TAKES OFF THE HAT, AND OPENS THE DOOR TO THE SEDAN FOR THE PAZZIS. 
ANGLE, ON FELL, AS HE TAKES HIS LEAVE. 
FELL Business.  Yes.  How much better.  To travel for the Pure Enjoyment of the thing, of the variety of the world....yes... (PAUSE) Just to Get Away. (PAUSE) I'm surprised they can spare you, in the midst of your investigation. (PAUSE, PAZZI LOOKS BACK) of the disappearance of my predecessor... 
ANGLE, AS MRS. PAZZI PULLS PAZZI INTO THE CAR. 
MRS. PAZZI (WHISPERING TO HIM) Take me home and make love to me... 
ANGLE, ON FELL, AS PAZZI WAVES TO HIM, THROUGH THE CAR WINDOW GLASS, AND THE CAR PULLS AWAY, LEAVING FELL STANDING IN THE ALLEYWAY.  BEAT.  HE NODS, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING TO HIMSELF. 
HE STARTS BACK OUT OF THE ALLEYWAY, INTO THE PRESS OF HUMANITY. 
MAN'S VOICE (VO) Time to get something to eat... 
ANGLE XCU 
ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS AFTER THE DEPARTING CAR. 
FELL (TO HIMSELF) Yes, quite... 
ANGLE, THE MAN SPEAKING TURNS, AND IS STARTLED TO SEE FELL. 
MAN I beg your pardon. 
FELL You suggested it was time to get something good to eat. 
MAN I thought that you were... (HE SEES ANOTHER MAN APPROACHING HIM) Ah!  Where shall we eat...? (THE TWO WALK OFF) 
FELL (TO HIMSELF) ...where shall we eat.  And what shall we eat. 
INT PAZZI'S APARTMENT. 
HALF SEEN, THROUGH A PANNING SHOT OF A HALFOPEN DOOR, PAZZI AND HIS WIFE MAKING LOVE.  WE HEAR PAZZI CALLING: 
PAZZI ...Laura...Laura...Laura... 
ANGLE 
ON FELL, IN THE SHADOWS, AS HE CLOSES THE FRONT DOOR SOUNDLESSLY BEHIND HIM.  HE STANDS FOR A MOMENT, LOOKING, CAMERA THEN TAKES HIM INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE HE FINDS THE KITCHEN. 
INT THE KITCHEN, FELL TAKES A KNIFE FROM A MAPLE BLOCK, TRIES ITS EDGE, REPLACES IT, TAKES OUT A CLEAVER, AND NODS.  HE LOOKS ABOVE, AND TAKES DOWN A COPPER SAUCEPAN FROM THE POT RACK.  HE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR, GLANCES BRIEFLY INSIDE, AND NODS, IN SATISFACTION, AND CLOSES IT. 
HE PICKS UP A DISHTOWEL, TRIES IT BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING ITS STRENGTH. 
HE PUTS IT DOWN, DISSATISFIED. 
HE BEGINS TO PROWL THROUGH THE APARTMENT, HE PASSES ANOTHER HALF OPEN DOOR, AND WE SEE PAZZI AND HIS WIFE, HALF GLIMPSED, BEYOND, FELL MOVES INTO A SMALL STUDY. 
ANGLE 
THE BACK OF THE DESK CHAIR, HOLDS A MAN'S SPORTCOAT, AND A TIE. 
FELL MOVES TOWARD THE CHAIR, PUTS HIS CLEAVER DOWN ON THE DESK, AND TRIES THE TIE BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING HIS STRENGTH. 
HE NODS, SATISFIED, AND PICKS UP THE CLEANER. 
ANGLE INS 
THE CLEANER, WHICH IS LAYING ON TOP OF THE FILE REGARDING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF DOTTORE FANELLI, BENEATH IT, HALF COVERED, IS THE FBI LOGO. 
WE SEE FELL'S HAND RAISE THE FIRST FILE, TO LOOK AT THE SECOND, AND WE READ: "FBI REPORT, THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, ETC, OF HANNIBAL LECHTER." 
ANGLE CU.

OUISA We knew Geoffrey 
FLAN through our children when Geoffrey and his family all lived in New York. 
OUISA They've moved back to South Africa. 
FLAN He was here in New York briefly on business and asked us to ask him for dinner. 
OUISA He's King Midas rich. Literally. Gold mines. THE WAITER puts down the tray of drinks. 
FLAN Seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine. 
OUISA But he is always short of cash because his government won't let its people -- 
FLAN Its white people -- 
OUISA -- its white people take out any money. So it's like taking in a War Baby. 
(TO WAITER) Thank you. That one's mine - THEY switch drinks. 
FLAN When he called it was like a bolt from the blue as I had a deal coming up and was short by 
OUISA 
TWO MILLION FLAN puts down his drink. 
FLAN The figure is superfluous OUISA turns to CONNIE. 
OUISA I hate when he uses the word "superfluous". I mean, we needed two million and we hadn't seen Geoffrey in a long time and while Geoffrey might not have the price of a dinner he easily might have two million dollars. 
FLAN The currents last night were very churny. 
CUISA we weren't sucking up. We like Geoffrey. 
FLAN It's that awful thing of having truly rich folk for friends. 
OUISA Face it. The money does get in the - 
FLAN Only if you let it. The fact of the money shouldn't get in- 
OUISA Having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes life boats. But the friend gets very touchy if you say one word: life boat. (THE CHUMS laugh.) Well, that's two words. We were afraid our South African friend might say "You only love me for my. life boats?" But we like Geoffrey. 
CONNIE I know who he is now. 
JULIA Lovely man. 
X 
SANDY Didn't he invite us to visit him? 
FLAN It wasn't a life-threatening evening. 
OUISA - Rich people can do something for you even if you're not sure what it is`you want them to do. THEY turn at the sound of applause. THE BRIDE and GROOM have entered the Country Club and our table in the bar looks up as THE WEDDING PARTY passes by for a moment rushing past the Bar into the ballroom. Off in the ballroom THE SMALL ORCHESTRA strikes up "Just One Of Those Things" for the ten thousandth time. EVERYONE in the club is applauding and OUR TABLE applauds too. OUISA starts to rise. 
OUISA Should we? 
CONNIE Not on your life. CONNIE pulls OUISA back down to the table. 
FLAN signals another round. 
FLAN Hardly a Life Boat evening - OUISA sits, enjoying this. 
OUISA (SING-SONG) Portentous. 
FLAN But when Geoffrey called and asked us to take him for dinner, he made a sudden pattern in life's little tea leaves because who wants to go to banks? FLAN'S VOICE takes us back to last night 
INT THE KITTREDGE.'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT 
FLAN (VO) Geoffrey called and our tempests settled into showers and life was manageable. What more can you want? 
GEOFFREY stands up into the frame, an elegant, impeccably British South African, more English than the English, ten years older than Ouisa and Flan. FLAN and OUISA are both dressed very stylishly and nattily tonight. But not trendy, not so it shows. FLAN was definitely an athlete and he still keeps himself in trim. If HE's in the art world, there's nothing arty about him. 
GEOFFREY Listen. OUISA stops doing what she's doing which is rolling out a drink trolley with little hors d'oeuvres on plates. FLAN stops doing what he's doing which is checking that a slide projector is in place on the desk along side the silver beaver inkwell. FLAN and OUISA both tense. 
FLAN What's wrong? 
GEOFFREY It always amazes me when New York is so quiet. OUISA and FLAN relax and laugh. 
OUISA With the kids away, we get used to a lower noise quotient. FLAN pours a drink for GEOFFREY.

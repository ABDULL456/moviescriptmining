BOB He's right. This has nothing to do with us. I don't understand. 
MARISSA You don't have to. I'm making the call. BOB and WALT exchange a look. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be all. The video screen flickers off, people take their files and start to leave. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness. 
35 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 35 
HANNA sits in her bed reading her encyclopaedia. ERIK, dressed incongruously in the suit and tie, enters and sits on the edge of her bed. She doesn't look up from her book. His face shows more emotion than we've seen before. 
ERIK Hanna... HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear. 
ERIK (CONT'D) Tell me again? 
HANNA Marissa Weigler. 
ERIK Then? 
HANNA Postcard. 
ERIK Then? 
HANNA What? 
ERIK The address where we meet. 
HANNA Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks at her with paternal care. 
ERIK Good night my sweet girl. He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him. 
HANNA Father... He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation. 
ERIK You can do this. You're ready. Just remember what I've taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him. 
HANNA I'll see you there. 
36 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT. 36 
ERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath. 
37 INT/EXT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 37 
HANNA gets out of bed and goes to the small window. 
She watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last time. 
38 EXT. EDGE OF NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT. 38 
Dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of impending night on the snow. Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil down to the ground. 
39 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 39 
HANNA is doing push-ups on her bedroom floor. 
40 EXT. FOREST/CABIN - NIGHT 40 
Infra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest wearing night vision-goggles. The Leader of the Operation follows the tracker signal. 
SPECIAL OPS Is this guy one of ours? 
HEAD OF OPS Used to be. Tread carefully, he's been in there a long time, he's damaged goods, and he knows we're coming. We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the pitch blackness. The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the breathing of men in the icy cold. 
41 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 41

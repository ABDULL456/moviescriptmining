PELOQUIN: The bite was mine. The bite that mocks death. 
LORI: That doesn't make him yours. I belong here on this wall, just as much as you do. Why aren't I here? 
PELOQUIN: You're still a Natural. Go back while you've still got a life. Join your tribe. 
LORI: That? My tribe? Not any longer. 
PELOQUIN: Then die with us. It's over. 
Peloquin exits. Lori looks back at the images on the walls once more. Then she exits. 
242. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT 
Boone, Joyce and Babette approach the hole where Lori fell. 
BABETTE: Let me down. I can't go any further. 
BOONE: Why not? 
BABETTE [looking down into the hole]: Baphomet. 
BOONE [to Joyce]: Take her. Run. 
Joyce nods and moves off with her into the smoke. As she disappears, Decker steps forward from the smoke. 
DECKER: Quite a dance, huh? Death everywhere and you and me in the middle. Catch! 
He throws the head of a Breed at Boone. 
DECKER: Even the dead can die! 
Then Decker strikes out at him, slashing at Boone's face. Boone falls backwards. At the last moment he catches hold of Decker, pulling him down into the hole and together they tumble into the earth. 
243. SCENE DELETED 
244. INT. MIDIAN 
Boone and Decker land on one of the rope bridges. Boone heads across it, pursued by Decker, who slashes at his neck, cutting him. 
DECKER: Almost! 
Boone falls back. Decker closes on him, the knives at his neck. The force of his stabs, which miss Boone's neck, break the boards of the bridge. Boone braces his feet beneath Decker and tosses him over. Decker gets up and approaches him again, slashing the ropes of the bridge with his blades as he comes. The fighters connect and struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the bridge, dropping them down another level. Decker lands very heavily, and lies still. Boone gets up. His exit along the bridge in one direction is blocked. He has to step past Decker who doesn't move. Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up, pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the knives at his victim's back. The blade cuts straight through Boone, sticking out from his chest a good six inches. He turns, his fury transforming him into a more extreme creature. Decker comes at Boone with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck. The battle carries them off the bridge onto the stairs. Decker takes hold of Boone's hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace. Boone reaches for a weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask. Decker lets go. Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table. 
Decker follows down the stairs. Boone pulls the table off his chest, leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest. Decker follows through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the fight continues. Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with. Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and driving him out on to the ledge once more. Decker teeters on the edge, now defenceless. Boone approaches. 
BOONE: Want to dance? 
He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling Decker on his own blade. Decker screams. 
Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge. Decker falls. 
Boone stands on the ledge, and spits down at the corpse. As he does so he hears the same roar from Baphomet that called the Berserkers from harming him. Out of it, comes Baphomet's face. 
BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone! 
244A. INT. LYLESBURG'S CHAMBER 
The chamber is empty of life. There are two or three corpses on the floor. We approach the central dais, on which is perched the statue of Baphomet, surrounded by six white heads. Momentarily, lines of light break from the statue's head and strike the white heads, which in turn begin to glow... 
244B. INT. VARIOUS CHAMBERS 
In the chambers we've seen before we see copies of the six statues, in front of which are bowls of Baphomet's fluid...They begin to glow, the brightness building. Sparks rise from the fluid. 
245. INT. BERSERKERS' CORRIDOR 
Lori sits, exhausted, in the corridor. She looks up to see Boone, with the knife still transfixing him. 
LORI: My God... 
BOONE: Decker's dead. Take the knife out. 
Lori pulls the knife from him, and throws it down. 
BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone! 
LORI: Don't go... 
BOONE: I'm. responsible. I have to. 
Lori and Boone head down the corridor, passing Ashberry, who is standing in the shadows. 
Lori and Boone head down the stairs towards the chamber. 
246. INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER 
Blinding light. As Boone descends into the chamber, he sees eight Nightbreed, surviving members of a Senior Council, Rachel among them, standing around Baphomet. They are wrapping severed limbs of Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus. His head and shoulders remain suspended in the light. Baphomet's lips move, making a terrible, eloquent sound. Rachel translates, the deep voice we hear coming from her lips. 
RACHEL/BAPHOMET: Come closer... 
Boone obeys. Baphomet's remaining arm reaches down and holds Boone, as Baphomet's face stares down at him. 
RACHEL/BAPHOMET: ...You have destroyed our refuge... 
BOONE: I never meant... 
Baphomet silences him. Boone trembles but maintains eye contact. 
RACHEL/BAPHOMET: This was foretold. No refuge is forever. But you are charged . . . 
BOONE: Yes...

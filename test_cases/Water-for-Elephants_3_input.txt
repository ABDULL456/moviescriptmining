The show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing for the aerialist act in the background. 
As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses paths with August, whose face is "dark as thunder"¬ù. 
JACOB How's Marlena? 
AUGUST A little shaky. Sore wrists. Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be fine. Did you catch the bull? 
JACOB She's in the menagerie. 
AUGUST Good. August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him; 
JACOB August! Wait! She was good! She came back on her own! Besides, you can't do anything now! The show is still going on. 
AUGUST 
(WALKING) Good. The band will drown it out. 
JACOB 
AUGUST, NO! Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent. 
MARLENA (O.S.) Jacob! Jacob sees Marlena running towards him. 
EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT 
Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see: 
INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT 
August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the entrance as Jacob runs to August. 
MARLENA 
AUGUST...STOP!!! August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with: 
AUGUST Get her out of here! NOW! Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August continues to beat Rosie. 
EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT 
Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans into him. Jacob loves being this close to her. The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see: Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He is kicking and struggling against them like a madman. Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone. 
INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes. Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken. 
JACOB Rosie, what am I going to do with you? Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk lifts and wipes at her own eye. 
Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket. 
GREG Here this will help. Poor beast. He really hurt her. Told you about him. (Curses August in POLISH) Don't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place. He shouldn't have the right, if you ask me. Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie. 
EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT 
Earl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook. Alerted; 
EARL'S MAN Somebody better find Earl. 
INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
Jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar. He moves through it. The stateroom is in a shambles. An open suitcase of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor. 
AUGUST (O.S.) Marlena...! August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks uncharacteristically distraught...teary eyed and unkempt. 
AUGUST (CONT'D) Do you know where Marlena is? Did she send you? 
JACOB No....What happened?

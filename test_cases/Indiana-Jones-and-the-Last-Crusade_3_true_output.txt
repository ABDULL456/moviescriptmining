ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal. 
INDY Elsa! Elsa, don't movel 
ELSA It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine. 
INDY Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here. 
A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams. 
ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach. As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor. 
HENRY Junior!  Junior! 
With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. She has to choose. 
INDY Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you. 
CONTINUED: 
ELSA I can reach it. I can reach it... 
Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp. 
INDY Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me your other hand! 
ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death. 
INDY (horrified) Elsa!! 
Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other. 
HENRY Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!! 
INDY I can get itI can almost reach it, Dad. 
INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing can ever be retrieved. 
HENRY Indiana. Indiana!! 
INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before. 
HENRY (very calmly) ... let it go... 
INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands. HENRY pulls him up to safety. 
THE GRAIL KNIGHT 
looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush from the crumbling Temple. 
INDY Dad. . . 
The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY. 
CONTINUED: 
INDY Please, Dad... 
INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he watches them leave. 
EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON 
INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through the Grecian Facade. 
From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance. 
HENRY turns to INDY. 
HENRY Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize. 
INDY What did vou find, Dad? 
HENRY Me?... Illumination. 
HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son. 
HENRY What did you find, Junior? 
INDY Junior?! Dad... 
SALLAH Please...What does it always mean, this...this "Junior?" 
HENRY That's his name. Henry Jones, Junior. 
INDY I like Indiana. 
HENRY We named the dog Indiana. 
BRODY May we go home now, please? 
CONTINUED: 
SALLAH (to INDY) The dog!? (laughs) You are named after the dog... 
INDY (embarrassed) I've got a lot of fond memories of that dog. 
A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh at INDY.

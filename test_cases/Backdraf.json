{"train": "\"BACKDRAFT\" \nScreenplay by \nGregory Widen \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - STORAGE ROOM - 20 YRS. EARLIER \nDarkness. Then the GLINT of a flashlight. Its beam rocks crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room as we hear two children arguing. \nOLDER KID You're doing it wrong. \nYOUNGER KID Shut up. \nOLDER KID You're doing it wrong. \nIt's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African masks. \nBeneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their pajamas. \nSTEPHEN It doesn't go like that. \nBRIAN Who asked you? \nSTEPHEN If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE. \nThe door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS McCAFFREY. \nDENNIS Who's going to die? \nSTEPHEN Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right. \nDENNIS (gestures for them to come out) Well, let's have a look. \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY \nThe two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat. \nDENNIS Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned. \nSTEPHEN And DIE! \nBRIAN You wouldn't let me die, would you, Dad? \nDENNIS McCaffreys are smarter than fire, Brian. (playfully slaps their shoulders) How 'bout lunch, huh? \nSTEPHEN Fireman shit? \nDENNIS Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn? \nSTEPHEN Firehouse. \nDENNIS Cute. \n-- The station suddenly fills with the BELLOW of an ALARM KLAXON. \nDENNIS (sighs) Never fails... \nA young fireman, ADCOX, appears with the dispatch card. \nDENNIS Big deal? \nAXE Medium deal. \nDENNIS Want to come along, Brian? Watch the old man earn his keep? \nSTEPHEN (pissed) Dad! \nDENNIS You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes. (to Brian) How 'bout it, sport? \nBRIAN Sure! \nDennis scoops Brian up and loads him into the fire engine cab. The other three firemen climb aboard and take their places. \nEXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY \nThere's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine is pulling out of the station. \nDENNIS Hit the button, Brian. \nBrian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older brother. \nThey stick their tongues out. \nEXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER \nThe engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency lights bouncing crazily off shop windows. \nEXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER \nTIM What'cha got? \nDRIVER Box alarm. Walton Ave. \nTIM We'll meet ya. \nEXT. BROWNSTONE - WALTON AVENUE - NIGHT \nAs Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode earlier. Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie. \nBrian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him. \nOne of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield. It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy angles. A dog barks furiously at it. \nTIM (also looking at body) Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening. \nBRIAN Backdraft. \nThe brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy clouds of dirty white steam. And one of the firemen is coming back out now, walking toward Brian. \nWhen he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a dead ringer for HIS FATHER. \nSTEPHEN Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it? \nBRIAN I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me. \nSTEPHEN So you're going to fight fires now, huh? \nHe pats Brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears. \nSTEPHEN (re smears) Doesn't work on you. (turns to leave) See ya around, little brother. \nBRIAN Not likely. \nSTEPHEN (turns) Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company. (Brian's color drops a hue) One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian... \nAnd Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts. \nEXT. BROWNSTONE - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT \nA flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette. The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield. It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, and crosses the street to the building. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nCharred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness. Rimgale is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight. He crouches down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard. \nSHADOW If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll start charging you admission. \nStephen is leaning in the doorway, watching him. \nSTEPHEN Got a cause? \nSHADOW Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke. \nSTEPHEN The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home. \nRimgale's flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose and holds up to the light. He lowers it, takes in the walls, the room. \nSHADOW They're gonna have to wait a few days on this one. \nEXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nTim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon. There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car, and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER. \nBRIAN (to coroner crew) Hey, you forgot... this. \nThey're already climbing into the wagon. The driver smiles creepily. \nCORONER DRIVER We always leave something for the dogs. \nBrian looks across the fireground, sees his brother walking back to the fire engine. They share a brief, edgy glance. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nA modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy fire truck on the drive. \nBRIAN Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man? \nThe kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition. \nBRIAN It's Uncle Brian. Y'know. \nHe makes his hand into a talking puppet. \nBRIAN (bandito accent) \"Spinach? We don't need no stinking spinach\". Remember? \nThe kid drops his toy truck and flees inside. \nKID Mom! Mom! \nINT. HELEN'S HOUSE \nINT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY \nBrian opens the trunk of his old BMW. It's full of stereo boxes marked BRIAN'S \"SOUND SPECTRUM\". \nINT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - CABIN - DAY \nBrian's gutted the speakers and is re-wiring them. \nSTEPHEN People actually used to pay you for this? \nBRIAN Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors. \nSTEPHEN Sheep don't count. \nBRIAN Yeah? What about Laura -- \nSTEPHEN That was never proved. \nBrian moves over to another speaker. \nSTEPHEN Why'd you come here, Brian? \nBRIAN I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother \"you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed\" games? \nSTEPHEN (sighs) What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man. \nBRIAN Hey! You don't know me -- \nSTEPHEN I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer? \nBRIAN So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood? \nSTEPHEN Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it. \nBrian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches on the tape player. The cabin fills with sharp, crystal clear -- Stephen Bishop. \nBRIAN There's only so much technology can do. (picks up his tool box) Thanks for the beer. \nSTEPHEN Thanks for the speakers. \nEXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY \nBrian climbs down off the boat. Looks up at Stephen. \nBRIAN Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt... \nSTEPHEN Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like. \nBRIAN I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know. \nSTEPHEN I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow. \nINT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nA simple one-room walk-up. A stereo blares Chicago blues as Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror. He steps back, looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am I doing... \nEXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - STREET - MORNING \nBrian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration. \nINT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MORNING \nA pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the morning snap, passes by Brian's window. Tough Midwestern brick. Tough Midwesterners. Heads-down in their 150 year war with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into Lake Michigan. \nEXT. EL STATION - MORNING \nThe train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and comes on. \nEXT. FIRE STATION 17 - MORNING \nBrian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights flashing, pull out onto the apron. \nThe fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey. \nSTEPHEN You're too late, probie. \nTim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs begin heading down the street. \nBRIAN (chasing) Goddamn it, Stephen... \nBrian bolts full-out for the engine. At the last instant before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags him aboard. \nINT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE 17 - DAY \nIt's Adcox, the fireman from the first scene, now a veteran. \nAXE Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'? \nbegin HACKING their way toward Brian's company as -- BOOM! It's a sudden, shattering vibration that shakes the building to its foundations. Then, a sucking sound: RUSH-RUSH-RUSH... Stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset. \nSTEPHEN Hey Otis, is it...? \nSCHMIDT (into radio) Yeah. \nSTEPHEN Goddamn it, where's our backup? Where's the second-in companies? \nSCHMIDT'S VOICE Sorry, man. John Wayne time. \nSTEPHEN (to firemen) Dig in! \nThe firemen hesitate. PENGELLY, the Truck Company Lt., looks at Stephen with concern. \nSTEPHEN Dig in, goddamn it! \nThe crews immediately gather in the center of the floor. They turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier. A circling of the wagons. -- BOOM! rush-rush-rush -- BOOM! Each louder than the last. Stephen and Brian are ducked behind an overturned desk. Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines like frontiersmen's Winchesters. \nSTEPHEN You're gonna love this. \n-- rush-rush-rush -- CRAAAASH!! On an instant the world comes apart as all four walls of factory windows EXPLODE in a hail of glass. A wave of HOWLING FLAME POURS IN after it, SHRIEKING and HISSING. \nAt the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman, SANTOS, FALLS THROUGH, grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW UP from underneath. He SCREAMS as his grip loosens. \nGrindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and coat. Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen SHOVES him out of the way to back up Grindle. \nSANTOS Help... Oh God... \nAdcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. Water and flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling ROAR. It's a thrashing, murderous standoff. \nStephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad. Blow it now and all three could take a header. Santos is panicking, losing his grip. Grindle bores his eyes into the man's with the calm and conviction of Moses. \nGRINDLE You go, we go. \nThey may all die, but they won't leave him. He calms a little, hangs on till they PULL him out of harm's way. Adcox continues with the hose as suddenly, everyone HITS the deck as the fire EXPLODES over them, BURSTING their coats into flame. Tim's company opens up their line, WASHING everybody down before CHARGING after the fire. A ladderman, NIGHTENGALE, steps on Brian's back. \nBRIAN Hey! \nNIGHTENGALE Sorry man, I thought you were dead. \nBrian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. Stephen seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a corner. The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its furious anger. But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying. \nPENGELLY (ladder co. captain) Stephen! BC's on the radio. Says they think a civilian got left behind downstairs. \nSTEPHEN Adcox! Take Tim and do a search. \nAdcox leads Tim downstairs. Brian looks shaken up. Stephen helps him roughly to his feet. \nSTEPHEN Don't you fold on me now, man. \nBrian burns at that and shakes his brother's arm off. \nSTEPHEN Clear the hose for me. \nBrian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it. small voice. Faint. \"Help me...\" \nBRIAN Hey, I think it's coming from a different staircase. \nNobody hears. -- Brian takes off down the other steps on his own. \nINT. BURNING FACTORY - DOWNSTAIRS \nIt's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow. \nOff the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines. Brian enters one and drops to his knees. \nLooks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand. Nothing. He turns to backtrack his way out when A TONGUE OF FLAME suddenly LEAPS up through the floor in front of him, cutting off the door. Brian lands on his ass as it hisses and giggles and dances unreally in front of him. \nI never forget a face, kid. -- That fire from childhood. He could maybe force his way through but Jesus, the way it looks at him -- \n-- Brian ROLLS away from it. Looks for another doorway -- And ends up in thick smoke. He drops to a crawl, stays on his belly where the air's clear. When he sees it. Behind some furniture. Something flesh-colored. Shit. It's a body. He crawls up closer. It's a woman. Adrenalin pounding the top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down the hall, makes a turn -- \nBRIAN I got one! \nEXT. FACTORY - DAY \n-- And now he's bursting from the building onto a short fire escape, shouting at the top of his lungs. \nBRIAN I got somebody! I got somebody! \nA sea of media flashbulbs ERUPTS in his face. The press have arrived in force, crowding the street. Brian pushes through them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine. Two fire paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure. \nBRIAN Is she... Is she alive? \nThe paramedics suddenly stop their efforts. Turn to Brian. \nPARAMEDIC I'm afraid you're a little too late with this one. \nThey step aside. Brian looks down. The woman looks strange. Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and shaken, turns and walks away. He passes Grindle and Tim, sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the REAL woman that was found inside. \nGRINDLE Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I heard you two were close. \nSwayzak's leaning on it. We sense the dislike between them. Swayzak steps aside. Rimgale pops the trunk. \nSHADOW Awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground, Alderman. But then I guess you haven't been to too many fires. \nJENNIFER I wanted to talk to you about Alan Seagrave's death. We still haven't gotten a fire report from your office. \nSHADOW You'll have an answer as soon as I do. \nSWAYZAK People are asking how a prominent taxpayer got stuffed through the windshield of his own car. They're asking me. \nJENNIFER --The point is, Investigator, you haven't even told us yet if the fire was accidental. We're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case to embarrass the Alderman because of his fire dept. reorganization program -- \nSHADOW -- You mean his firehouse closing program, -- Don't you? \nJENNIFER We'd just be very disappointed if it turned out your office was playing politics. \nSWAYZAK -- Because I'm not. I care about this city, and I care about this department -- \nRimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid. \nSHADOW (calm of a monk) Alderman, I have a remarkably uncomplicated job. To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it. But to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees, well, I guess I can't say I sleep any less peacefully. \nAnd he walks back to the burned building. \nSWAYZAK I wish I could just fire the son of a bitch. \nSTEPHEN Hey! Swayzak! \nStephen's leaning out of an upstairs window. As the TV cameras turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops right into Swayzak's face with a murderous grin. \nSTEPHEN We almost lost a whole company up there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back- up since you closed '33. And we really appreciate it, the guys and me. Honest. I know you've got my vote for mayor. \nGrindle and Santos start walking for Stephen. Brian's there, following after them. \nSWAYZAK Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's a problem, please, work with our task force to fix it. \nSTEPHEN Oh yeah, your famous task force... three guys have already died this year because of the cuts made by your \"task force\"... \nGRINDLE Stevie, c'mon man... \nStephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand. Swayzak leans close, out of earshot of the cameras. \nSWAYZAK You see that funny glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye, Lt? That's your career dissipation light -- and it just went into overtime. \nSTEPHEN If anybody's light's gonna blink, it's yours. \nSwayzak holds his ground. It's a tense, out of control moment between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred. \nAXE You're in firemanland now, Swayzak. Do yourself a favor and just walk away. \nSwayzak holds Adcox's gaze, then turns for his car. Brian watches Jennifer climb in beside her boss. \nBRIAN This is your city job? \nJennifer shrugs as they pull away. \nINT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - LATE DAY \nBrian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway. Across the street a middle-aged woman flashes them from the balcony of her apartment. \nAXE That's Franny. She likes firemen. \nSTEPHEN Tim, fill out the alarm card. (to Brian) Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose. \nAdcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks. Tim shrugs. Brian sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor before freezing suddenly at a murderous GROWL. Brian turns and sees a DOG. Sort of. It has the rib cage of a wild beast, fangs, long greasy hair. It blocks his way, SNARLING with hate. \nGRINDLE That's The Thing. You can't stay unless he likes you. \nSlobber drools out of its mouth as it GROWLS. \nBRIAN Have you guys got something against dalmatians? \nBrian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face, looks back and forth between Franny and The Thing, and sighs. \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM \nBrian enters, strips down his battered uniform, and opens his locker. The mannequin from the fire SPRINGS OUT, legs spread. A sign taped to its mouth says: \"TAKE ME BRIAN, YOU'RE MY SUPERMAN!\" \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - WASHROOM \nBrian and the others scrub the morning's fire off their bodies in the station shower. Tim keeps filling his mouth full of water and launching it upward in a stream. \nBRIAN Do you have to do that? \nTIM (pumped) Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch. \nBrian compares himself to the praise heaped on Stephen. \nBRIAN Thanks. \nSTEPHEN Brian -- (a beat that hangs there) -- See ya tonight. \nINT. RESTAURANT - RETIREMENT PARTY - NIGHT \nThat's been cleared out for a huge PARTY in full swing. An Irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat. City brass--including Alderman Swayzak -- a few reporters, firemen and their families all mix together for this is a RETIREMENT PARTY for the Captain Fitzgerald. Brian enters, seeks out a beer at the bar. Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly not his first drink of the evening. \nSTEPHEN Hey. \nBRIAN Hey. \nCHEERS as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief. Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man. He turns away. \nSTEPHEN I gotta change the view... \nSantos and Grindle walk up. \nGRINDLE Heard you didn't make the list for captain, man. I'm sorry... \nStephen just shrugs. \nBrian sees Jennifer across the room. She looks great. Refined as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and calling various politicos by their first name. \nAs she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink. As she accepts, a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red syrup. \nBRIAN (holding bottle, interrupting) With grenadine, right? \nJENNIFER When I was twenty. \nBRIAN Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun? \nHer attention broken, the politico has slipped away. Annoyed, Jennifer leads Brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at him. \nJENNIFER Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here. \nBRIAN Carrying Swayzak's notebook? \nJENNIFER Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor. \nBRIAN Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy? \nJENNIFER Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side -- \nBRIAN -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt. \nJENNIFER Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it? \nJennifer instantly cuts off as a well-dressed COUPLE passes and switches stunningly into schmmoze-mode. \nJENNIFER (to man) -- Tom, how nice to see you. I know Marty'll be very happy you came. Thanks so much for the donation. (to woman) Marie... how's little Kevin? Really? Seen the polls? This is the year... \nThey move away. Jennifer turns to Brian and switches just as fast back to their argument. \nJENNIFER -- The thing that really makes me angry is the way your union has -- \nBrian can't help it. He cracks up. \nBRIAN What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard. \nJENNIFER Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters. \nBRIAN I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II. \nBrian turns and walks away. \nACROSS THE ROOM \nAdcox is talking with another knot of firemen. He's brought a date, SALLY, a hot little number that has a habit of standing on her tip-toes when she talks. \nSALLY (looking at Swayzak across room) Yuck, what a scumbag. \nAXE (to Santos) Fuckin' city transferred Sally three months ago out of parking violations into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta pay my own goddamn tickets and she's stuck with an asshole. \nSANTOS Pay more? \nSALLY (shrugs) No, but there's more exercise -- being chased around a desk. \nThere's a commotion at the other end of the bar. A group of firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine. \nGRINDLE Aw, I don't believe this shit. \nSCHMIDT Somebody get a shovel! You seen this, Stephen? \nAs they hold it up to Stephen we see a photo spread titled DARING FIRE RESCUE. \nThe first photo shows Brian rushing out of the burning building with seemingly a woman in his arms. The second photo shows the backs of Adcox and Tim's helmets as they administered aid to the real woman they saved. The implication is it's the same woman. \nBRIAN What? \nTIM (reads) \"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death...\" \nJACKSON Savin' a mannequin... How fuckin' stupid can a guy get? \nStephen suddenly PUNCHES Jackson. \nSTEPHEN You can't talk about my brother like that... \nHELEN (sighs) Here we go... \nAnd Stephen PLOWS into Jackson. Another fireman JUMPS to Jackson's aid. And Brian's there, defending his brother, PUNCHING OUT a fireman. The crowd finally pulls the two apart. \nJACKSON You're crazy, man! \nSTEPHEN Leave me alone! \nAXE Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! (Stephen calms a little) You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life? \nSTEPHEN No. (beat) I need a drink. \nStephen takes a step for the bar -- then suddenly turns and JUMPS Jackson again. Brian pulls him off and drags him for the door. \nBRIAN You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here... \nAs Jennifer watches Brian lead Stephen out the door. \nJENNIFER (to Swayzak) Ah those McCaffreys... just hate leaving a party with anyone left standing... \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nBrian leads Stephen toward his car. \nSTEPHEN I'm okay... leave me alone... \nStephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the sidewalk. \nBRIAN So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what? \nSTEPHEN Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know? \nBrian stands there and folds his arms. \nSTEPHEN I don't think I can get up. \nBrian lends an arm. \nSTEPHEN Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too. \nBRIAN C'mon, let's crawl home. \nEXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT \nStephen throws an arm over Brian's shoulder as he leads him up onto the boat. \nSTEPHEN ...Adcox, those guys...they don't get it... it isn't the goddamn promotion... or dad... I'm not my old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get me... I don't give a shit about being a captain... it's just... it's just they don't trust me anymore... (blows out painful breath) ...they don't trust me anymore... \nINT. STEPHEN'S BOAT \nBrian's flops his brother on the bed. Unties his shoes. \nSTEPHEN If you'd get out of my fuckin' way. I could take my own goddamn shoes off... \nHe clearly can't. Brian slips them off. \nSTEPHEN You're such a pain in the ass... You've always been a pain in the ass... \nThere's just a grim wall lamp above Stephen's face. \nSTEPHEN Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind... \nBRIAN (touching light) This? \nSTEPHEN Yeah... too bright... \nBrian turns off the dim light. Stephen's breathing deepens. \nSTEPHEN They don't know... they don't know what I hear in there... \nBrian tucks the blanket around him. \nSTEPHEN ...This boat could be okay, huh?... Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me... \nStephen's voice drifts off into sleep. Brian watches a moment, the rare look of peace on his brother's face, then leaves. \nEXT. FIRE ACADEMY - NIGHT \nDark and still. Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the chain link. \nEXT. FIRE ACADEMY - EXERCISE GROUND - NIGHT \nIs a practice stand-pipe. Brian counts down to himself, then rushes the stand-pipe, spinning off the cap with a hydrant wrench and attaching the hose coupling. He does it again, over and over. \nEXT. FIRE ACADEMY - DAWN \nSTEPHEN (looking at watch) Alright... Go! \nTim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building. There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags the other end inside and up a flight of stairs. \nSTEPHEN Go! \nBrian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the building. \nSTEPHEN That isn't a football, probie. Get it on your shoulder. \nBrian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end. Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another two flights. It's a bitch. \nSweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming up with another roll. \nBRIAN Having fun, fireman? \nTim flips him off. Brian laughs and sprints for another roll. \nSTEPHEN You're not breaking any records, Brian. \nBrian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside. \nSTEPHEN Your shoulder. Like this! \nBrian lifts it to his shoulder. \nSTEPHEN Come on! Pick it up! \nThey come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word spoken it's become a race between them. \nBrian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his feet. \nSTEPHEN Run, damn you! \nBrian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, Brian the \"winner\" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll, sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly. \nSTEPHEN Roll the hose. \nBRIAN What, are you kidding? By myself? \nAdcox and Tim, down below, have already disappeared back into the station. \nSTEPHEN You heard me. \nWe see now what Stephen apparently doesn't. He was scraped badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood. \nBRIAN What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time. \nSTEPHEN (in Brian's face) You got a problem with drilling, probie? \nBRIAN No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me. \nSTEPHEN Roll the hose. \nStephen turns and walks away. Brian stands there watching him in blind fury, finally exploding. \nBRIAN Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna quit. You hear me! \nAn awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by the station alarm klaxon. Stephen smiles. \nSTEPHEN Well, thank God for fires... \nEXT. FIRE STATION 17 - HOSE TOWER - BELOW - DAY \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE SHORE MANSION - NIGHT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. LAKE SHORE MANSION - NIGHT \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. LAKE SHORE MANSION - FRONT DOOR \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY \nSmoke and confusion. A MOTHER is screaming hysterically at Stephen as he jumps down from the engine. \nMOTHER (grabbing his coat) My baby! My baby's still up there! \nBATTALION CHIEF Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a hoseline coming. \nStephen doesn't even pause and enters the building. Brian hesitates a beat, then follows. \nStephen walks through the creepy, brutalized silence. Back to where Rimgale had focused his investigation that night. He searches the floor, the wall, looking for something... \nEXT. ARSON HQ/FIREHOUSE - DAY \nA crumbling one in Chinatown. Brian checks the address on his slip of paper. He stands there a beat, hating himself. \nINT. FIRE STATION/ARSON HQ \nIt's a regular station but for the rear that has been converted into arson squad offices. As Brian approaches the office door he can see Rimgale sitting at his desk. Standing nervously beside it is a fresh-faced, uniformed PROBIE. \nSHADOW (to probie) ...So stop me if I get this wrong... The fire's almost out... You're upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat. You've been told by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered. But now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero. Heroes don't just stand around. So on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation. Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline? \nThe kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation. \nSHADOW You could've crispered half your company with that little stunt, but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence I use to prove it's arson. You've made my day longer, Probie. Go home and think about that. \nThe kid shuffles off hang-dog. Rimgale's angry gaze falls on Brian. \nBRIAN Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant. \nSHADOW Your Dennis' kid. (beat) I work alone. \nAnd Rimgale walks into his office, leaving Brian marooned in the doorway. Stepping behind a small partition, Rimgale changes his shirt. Brian can just glimpse from where he stands a horrible burn that has consumed most of Rimgale's stomach. Rimgale catches the look. \nSHADOW Are you still here? \nBRIAN Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere. \nSHADOW Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way. \nBRIAN I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. \nSHADOW Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. (beat) You think you're the first? \nRimgale glances at his watch, puts on his coat, and picks up a small paper bag. \nBRIAN Where are you going? \nSHADOW Pest control. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAX SECURITY PRISON - DAY \nAnd the face of RONALD, an unremarkable man in his 40s. Unremarkable but for laser eyes and two heavily bandaged hands. Go wide and find him sitting in an institutional chair -- handcuffed, actually -- in an institutional hall. A uniformed guard stands nearby as Brian and Rimgale come down the corridor. Ronald smiles upon seeing Rimgale. \nRONALD Shadow. \nSHADOW How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable? \nRONALD Didn't think you'd make it. \nSHADOW Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal. \nRONALD (looking at Brian) Who's this? \nSHADOW He works for me. \nRONALD Is he a fireman? (smiles) I like firemen. \nSHADOW You like everybody, Ronald. \nRonald's eyes pick up Brian's name on his prison ID badge. \nRONALD Brian McCaffrey... (eyes light up happily) Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh? \nBRIAN (heating up) Hey, do I know you? \nSHADOW You don't know him. \nRONALD I know you. \nBRIAN (to Ronald) What the hell are you talking about my -- \nRimgale silences Brian with a threatening hand. \nSHADOW Knock it off. Now. \nRONALD Tell him about me, Shadow? \nSHADOW Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it? \nRONALD Did he tell you how we finally met? \nSHADOW Nobody cares, Ronald. \nRONALD Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here... \nVOICE IN CORRIDOR Okay... Ronald Bowland... \nThe cop helps Ronald to his feet and all four are marching down the hall. \nBRIAN (after a beat) What are you listening to? \nRimgale doesn't answer. His eyes drift over the scorched walls as he speaks softly to them. \nSHADOW You sneaky little son of a bitch... Hide and seek... Come on, tell me what I want to know... \nHe scratches at some soot. Smiles and lifts a small hand recorder. \nSHADOW (business-like into recorder) Heavy smoke stains observed in entry room. Demarkation line high. Fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off. It started somewhere else... (walks down hall) Less soot here. More heat. (they enter back room) And very little soot here. (to Brian) Get that couch out of the way. \nBrian pulls it aside. The lower third of the wall is completely untouched by soot. \nSHADOW (to himself) So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry... (into recorder) Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance. (to Brian) Find me some glass. \nBRIAN Glass? \nSHADOW Do we have a language barrier here? Glass. \nThere's some on the sill of a blown window. Brian hands a shard to Rimgale, who turns it over in his palm. \nSHADOW (into recorder) Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. (shuts recorder off) You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad? (then, an idea) Or scared. (switches on recorder) It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air... \nBRIAN -- Another backdraft. \nRimgale turns to the wall, a section where the plaster is severely damaged. He probes with a penknife. \nSHADOW Finish coat burned away... Severe spawling of rough coat... \nRimgale follows the damaged wall down -- down -- to a melted wall socket. \nSHADOW That's our ignition point. Dig it out. Carefully. \nBrian chops it out from the wall. Rimgale crouches down, peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires. The copper tip is severely melted. Rimgale sniffs the plug. \nSHADOW (into recorder) Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire. \nBRIAN No it couldn't. \nRimgale shuts off the recorder. Stares down Brian. \nBRIAN I mean you'd be right -- with normal wire. But that's gauge ten in that plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows why they put it in here -- but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot. (Rimgale just stares) In another life I was in high-end electronics. \nRimgale opens a plastic bag and puts the plug inside. \nSHADOW (into recorder) Have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants. \nRimgale stands and walks out. \nBRIAN Don't mention it. \nINT. THEATRE BUILDING - NIGHT \nBrian follows Rimgale down from the office into the vast theatre. Walls hiss and spit. Brian's surprised to see his former engine mates there, tromping and crunching their way through broken glass, their flashlights like dancing fireflies. Tim passes by. \nBRIAN Hey, Tim. \nEverybody turns at the voice and the air suddenly chills. \nTIM (distant) Brian. \nSHADOW (to Brian) Check the wall for burn patterns. \nAnd Rimgale's off to another room. Brian turns and looks at the wall. It's endless. \nBRIAN (to Tim) So, you surviving without me? \nTIM There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed. \nBRIAN Swayzak's not my boss. \nSilence. Brian looks over the wall. A dirty puddle separates him from it. \nGRINDLE (to Brian) Ooooh, like the tie. Love the tie. \nBRIAN Grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh? I would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know... \nGrindle stares at him a beat, then wordlessly steps into the muck and pulls free a section of wall, dropping it on the ground in front of Brian. Santos and Grindle look at each other. \nSANTOS Uh, Brian, if you're lookin' for smoke patterns, there's some good ones over here. \nBRIAN Yeah? Where? \nGRINDLE (as Brian walks over) Little to the right... further... further... Right behind there. Hey, could you hand me that pike pole? \nThere's a pike pole leaning against the wall. Brian pulls it aside. SPLASH -- The pole had been supporting a small, sagging piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty gallons of murky, putrid black water all over Brian's civvys. Nobody laughs. \nGRINDLE Sorry, maybe that wasn't it after all. \nStephen appears around the corner. Sees what's happened. \nSTEPHEN That's just about enough, guys, okay? \nSTEPHEN In a fire? Never. (beat) Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't... \nHELEN You can't keep being his father... \nStephen sighs deeply. \nSTEPHEN You know what I realized today? I can't remember my dad's face anymore. There's pictures of him staring at me everywhere I go, but the guy behind them... he's gone... \nHe sighs and hops down from the roof to the driveway. \nSTEPHEN I'll see ya around, Helen. \nShe watches him as he walks lonely up the street. \nINT. CITY MORGUE - DAY \nA Lab Tech, RICCO, leads Brian and Rimgale through the autopsy area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered in plastic. \nRICCO Okay, Alan Seagrave and Donald Cosgrove... \nIf you say so. Brian's stomach does a half-gainer as he's confronted by two hideously charred bodies. \nRICCO ...Both deaths due to close encounters with stationary objects; office door for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for Mr. Seagrave. No non-relevant traumas. No significant blood toxicology. Attitude of both trajectories consistent with explosions. \nBrian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf. \nRICCO They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it. \nSHADOW Putty? On both doors? \nRICCO There's something else kinda interesting... \nRicco lifts Benton's charred shoulder. Underneath we see some of his clothes that have melted and co-mingled with his flesh. \nRICCO See this? \nA credit card has been fried right into Cosgrove's skin about where his back pocket should have been. \nRICCO Guess he didn't leave home without it. \nRicco erupts in a honking laugh, then switches instantly back to a business tone. \nRICCO Anyway, down here, take a look... \nSHADOW McCaffrey, hold this for us. \nBRIAN Uh, I don't think that's in my contract... \nSHADOW I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere... \nWith supreme reluctance Brian pulls the crisper's head and shoulder away from the table. \nRICCO Jesus Christ, he isn't gonna try to sell you insurance, lift him. \nBrian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher. \nRICCO (to Rimgale) See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it. \nSHADOW Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago. \nRICCO Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire. \nSHADOW What the hell was it doing in the fire? \nRICCO That's your job. \nAt that instant, Cosgrove's eyes OPEN and his body SIGHS. Brian DROPS the body in shock and backs away, stunned. \nSHADOW I asked you to hold him, not feel him up... \nINT. RIMGALE'S CAR - DAY \nRimgale's FD sedan. Brian is still wringing imaginary guts off his hands. Rimgale tosses an open fire chem book in his lap. \nSHADOW Read. \nBRIAN \"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --\" \nSHADOW -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties. \nBRIAN \"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium\". \nSHADOW Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM! \nRimgale CLAPS his hands next to Brian's head, STARTLING him. \nSHADOW Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue. \nBRIAN Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder. \nRimgale looks at Brian. He's getting tired of this. \nBRIAN (eyes on Swayzak) Hey... (beat) So are you dating your boss or what? \nJENNIFER If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. (beat, sighs) Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes... \nBRIAN Sorry. (beat) Are you dating anyone? \nJENNIFER You think that's really any of your business? \nBRIAN Well, you did invite me here. \nJENNIFER Marty did. (beat, smiles) But I wanted you to come to. \nSwayzak suddenly appears with his entourage. \nSWAYZAK Mr. McCaffrey... \nBRIAN Nice boat. \nSWAYZAK It isn't mine. (to photographer) Let's get a picture. \nSwayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's shoulder. Another staffer slaps a SWAYZAK FOR MAYOR sticker to Brian's lapel. Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian. I'm sorry... Snap. \nSWAYZAK (seeing someone else) Larry! (sotto to Jennifer) What does he do again? \nSwayzak leads her off in pursuit. Left alone, Brian turns to the railing, stares off at the passing city. You can hear the wind-up of a siren. \nAnd there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker Drive. Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches it disappear. \nJENNIFER How's the job going? \nShe's appeared again beside him. \nBRIAN Okay. \nJENNIFER Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he? \nBRIAN No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one. \nJENNIFER Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not. \nBRIAN Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked. \nJENNIFER But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson. \nBRIAN In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah. \nBAMM! \nBoth of them look up sharply. A woman drunk out of her mind has tipped over in her chair. She laughs, her fellow tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. Jennifer takes Brian by the arm in the opposite direction and smiles. \nJENNIFER Save me. \nEXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT \nThe band's completely cut loose now. A wild percussion rhythm that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen. Brian and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through hair crazily askew. The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful as it slips past. The drums beat faster and harder and the only thing that isn't moving now is their eyes -- eyes locked on each other. \nEXT. ARSON HQ - NIGHT \nSweaty, flushed with the evening and a few drinks, Brian and Jennifer pull up in her car. \nBRIAN Thanks for the invite. \nJENNIFER Got anything to drink in there? \nBRIAN Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies. \nINT. ARSON HQ/FIRE STATION \nThe regular engine company's gone to bed and the arson squad's packed in for the night, leaving the apparatus floor quiet and dim as Brian and Jennifer enter. \nBrian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the rear where Rimgale has his offices. As they walk Jennifer's eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets, the press-tin ceiling. \nBRIAN This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think? \nJENNIFER Homey. \nBRIAN See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know? \nJENNIFER Do you miss it? (he doesn't answer) You seem like you do. \nBRIAN When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman. \nJENNIFER Then why did you quit? \nBRIAN I wanted to be a good one. \nINT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES \nThey walk into the back arson offices. Brian pokes through a few drawers, one or two shelves. Finally he lifts a squat, specialized fire extinguisher. The bottom has been hollowed out, leaving room for a fifth of bourbon. \nBRIAN Old firehouse trick. \nAXE Let me take the lead, Stephen... \nSTEPHEN Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job! \nAdcox folds. With a stricken look on his face he takes his crew down the other way. Stephen and Tim slowly feel their way. \nCRACK \nEverybody SPINS around in terror. Nothing. Something inhuman giggles down ahead of them. Stephen smiles. \nSTEPHEN (like a mantra) Oh, you're so very sly, but so am I... (to Tim) ...Listen to it... you can tell when a wall cracks which way it's gonna jump... you can hear the doors breathe if they're hot... \nTim looks confused. He doesn't get it. \nThey come to a side door. Stephen runs his hand down the jam, feels for heat. Then he steps back, takes a deep breath, and CRASHES the door down with one AXE BLOW. Quiet inside. \nINT. ARSON HQ - HOSE BED - NIGHT \nBrian and Jennifer are into the rhythm now, breathing deeply. On the wall above them are framed photos of dead firemen. Watching. \nINT. HIGH-RISE - SECOND DOORWAY - NIGHT \nStephen concentrates on the sound of the fire above him, -- then abruptly turns and CRASHES down another door. \nINT. ARSON HQ - ALARM KLAXON GOES OFF - NIGHT \nBrian and Jennifer lie in a tight embrace, enjoying the moment, the lull, as suddenly the lights SNAP ON and an alarm klaxon BELLOWS. Firemen are coming down the pole now. \nJENNIFER What's going on? \nThey frantically climb into their clothes. The firemen haven't noticed them as they climb aboard. They've STARTED THE ENGINE. \nJENNIFER What are they doing? \nEXT. ARSON HQ - STREETS - NIGHT \nAnd before either of them realizes it, they're suddenly pulling out into the street and WAILING off down the block. The wind's wild in their hair, the siren deafening, the flashing red lights blinding staccato, And Jennifer loves it. She kisses Brian fiercely, he lets out a war whoop lost in the blast of air, and together they hold each other as the night screams past and... \nEXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nEngine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise fire. Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to pull off lengths of hose from the bed. As the folds curl away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come out with it. \nWith equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the bed. \nBRIAN Excuse us. \nINT. HIGH-RISE - TIM'S DOOR - NIGHT \nStephen and Tim creep along the hall. \nSTEPHEN (to Tim) Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling... that means it's hiding... staying sleepy... one of these doors... \nTim's come to one. \nSTEPHEN (to himself) Easy... no hurry... you're not going anywhere... \nStephen BANGS down another door. Sticks his head in to check. A little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water. \nTim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as Stephen comes out of the room he was checking. Sees Tim lifting his axe. \nSTEPHEN Did you check the door for heat, Tim? \nTim doesn't hear. The axe is already up. \nSTEPHEN Tim? \nTim's committed now, coming hard at the door. And Stephen sees it for just an instant -- Small tendrils of smoke edging lazily around the door -- then being sucked back in. \nSTEPHEN Tim! \nHe rushes for Tim as Tim's axe SMACKS the door and a whine behind it builds and roars and howls and Tim's all follow- through now, hitting the door with his shoulder as \nThe door EXPLODES OUTWARD, HURLING TIM against the opposite wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror as A SHRIEKING TONGUE OF FLAME SHOOTS OUT THE DOORWAY and Grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames wrap Tim like a jealous lover as Adcox hears it and screams, \nAXE Oh God! Oh God no! \nAnd Tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, his face, it's all melting and Grindle dives suicidally at the monster, BLASTING it with his hose as Stephen ignores the flames and puts his arms around Tim as Grindle DOUSES them both, killing the flames. \nThe monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air shafts as Tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall as Stephen tries to help but oh God you can't tell what's face and what's mask and helmet anymore. \nGrindle looks back where the fire came from. There's a corpse in there, burned and lying between two doors. \nAdcox rushes to Tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end of the goddamn world... \nEXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nBrian and Jennifer are having the time of their lives, when suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a stretcher to an ambulance and Brian sees -- sweet Jesus -- it's Tim. Jennifer turns away in horror. They load Tim into the van as Adcox and Grindle jump in to ride along. To hold his hand. \nStephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street. Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat and slams it to the ground. He kicks it, kicks it till his strength's gone. He turns, his wounded eyes finding Brian. \nINT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nJENNIFER You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right. \nSwayzak appears in the doorway. He looks haggard, as if he hasn't slept. There's something haunted in his eyes. \nSWAYZAK Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy? \nBRIAN Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight. \nJENNIFER Oh Brian... \nBrian shoulders his way past Swayzak and walks out. \nINT. HOSPITAL - TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBrian walks up to Tim's room. Stephen's sitting there, ragged looking. Inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and gauze and years of wasted promise. An EKG beeps, a respirator hisses, and Brian gulps down something heavy in his throat. \nSTEPHEN He's gonna live. Maybe not much else, but he's gonna live... \nStephen walks away. \nEXT. ARSON HQ - MORNING \nAs Rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up. Swayzak opens the rear door from inside. \nSWAYZAK Inspector. \nSHADOW Alderman. \nINT. SWAYZAK SEDAN - DAY \nCruising through traffic. Swayzak is disheveled, unshaven, fidgety. A man who hasn't slept and had a few drinks before the one he's pouring now. He offers one to Rimgale. \nSHADOW I usually have breakfast first. \nSwayzak apparently doesn't. \nSWAYZAK When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don? \nSHADOW \"Don?\" \nSWAYZAK Don't you have any leads at all? \nSHADOW No Marty, I don't. \nFor the first time, Rimgale sees real fear on Swayzak's face. \nSHADOW We still haven't found a connection between the victims. \nSWAYZAK Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise! \nSHADOW Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet. \nThe sedan stops back at arson HQ. They'd gone around the block. \nEXT. ARSON HQ - SWAYZAK SEDAN - DAY \nRimgale opens the door, climbs out, lingers. \nSHADOW Is there a connection between them, Alderman? \nSWAYZAK Just catch the son of a bitch. \nThe door shuts and Swayzak roars away. \nINT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES - DAY \nRimgale walks back into his offices. He's surprised to see Brian there working at his desk. \nSHADOW What the hell are you doing here? \nBRIAN I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot. \nRimgale stares at Brian, appraises him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HIGH-RISE \nA CLOSE UP of Rimgale POPPING the molding around the door frame of Holcomb's burned office. Underneath can be seen traces of the same white residue from the other fires. \nSHADOW I thought 'ol Marty was acting a little strange... And he's right. \nRimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers. \nBRIAN Backdraft? \nRimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body lied between two doors. \nSHADOW The backdraft was set somewhere in there. It fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door. But the outer door held... and waited for Tim... \nBrian steps into the inner office. \nHis whole body aching with reluctance, Brian begins looking through them. Solvents, Armorall, a small specialty can of fire dept. chemicals. There's a label of ingredients on it. Way down at the bottom, Is trychticholorate. Nausea wracks its way through Brian. \nBRIAN Oh goddamn it Stephen... \nFootsteps. Brian spins around in stone shock as Stephen comes into the cabin. \nSTEPHEN Hey, what are you doing here? \nBRIAN Just... Just wanted to say hello... \nSTEPHEN So hello. \nBrian backs away from the chemicals. \nSTEPHEN Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes. \nBRIAN You're selling dad's boat? \nSTEPHEN Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them... \nBRIAN I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do. \nSTEPHEN Yeah? What have you got to do? (beat) Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay. \nBRIAN Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other -- \nSTEPHEN -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?! \nHe KICKS the bulkhead wall. \nBRIAN It's okay, Stephen, I -- \nSTEPHEN -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some. (beat) Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go... \nBrian turns to leave. Pauses. \nBRIAN I saw it. \nSTEPHEN Saw what? \nBRIAN When dad died, I saw another fire... \nSTEPHEN Everybody did. \nBRIAN I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die. \nSTEPHEN (stunned) ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there? \nBRIAN I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on... \nSTEPHEN Maybe I do. (sighs) ...What a fuckin' mess, huh? (beat) People can change Brian. \nBRIAN Sometimes right when you're looking at them. \nBrian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something freezes up inside. Stephen catches the look and there's horrible silence between them. \nBRIAN Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you? \nSTEPHEN I don't know, Brian... I don't know... \nEXT. FIRE STATION 17 - NIGHT \nBrian stands before the fire station. His brother's and his. \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - UPSTAIRS LOCKER ROOM \nBrian PRIES the lock off Stephen's locker. Starts looking through it. Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, starts shaving in a mirror. He doesn't notice Brian. Adcox turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little. And Brian's universe caves in. \nAn icy claw tears out his stomach. Gulping breaths, he forces himself to look at Adcox's back. \nOn it is a small, rectangular burn. It's fresh and it's the size of a wall socket. At that moment Adcox turns. The two of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks past him. Just then the alarm bells RING. Brian hesitates a beat, confused, then turns and runs down to \nINT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR \nWhere firemen are scurrying around, suiting up. Brian looks frantically for Stephen, sees him out back. \nEXT. FIRE STATION 17 - BACK OF STATION - SUNDOWN \nBRIAN (breathless) -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's -- \nSTEPHEN -- What are you doing here? \nBRIAN I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people! \nSTEPHEN I know. \nBRIAN How do you know? \nSTEPHEN I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me. \nBRIAN -- What were they doing there? \nBRIAN Did you do it for Tim? \nAXE (pain, to Stephen) That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me! \nBrian and Stephen are backed up against the roof edge -- sixty feet up. Far below a fireboat has begun pumping a massive stream at the side of the building. \nAXE You gotta let me finish -- \nBRIAN Just come down, John. Just -- \nAXE -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department! \nSTEPHEN -- Knock it off! \nAXE (to Stephen) -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man -- \nBRIAN -- He killed people -- \nAXE -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? -- \nBRIAN -- Stephen, this is bullshit -- \nAXE -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it -- \nAnd there's a horrible glimmer of confusion on Stephen's face. \nBRIAN You're his Lt., Stephen... (beat) Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen? \nSTEPHEN Shut up! \nAXE ...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do? \nSTEPHEN (beat) There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - ACROSS THE ROOF - NIGHT \nThe rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's happening through the smoke on the other side. Grindle and Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them. \nGRINDLE Shit... It's going! Clear the roof! Now! \nEverybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as \nEXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - BRIAN ET. AL - NIGHT \nBrian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes. \nThe center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING. \nAdcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole races for them, SWALLOWING roof. \nSTEPHEN Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn it! \nAnd Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles -- Brian LEAPS OFF the roof -- \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT \n-- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through, \nAnd falls. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT \nBlackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he CRASHES into a pool of water at the bottom. He's in a freight elevator shaft, thrashing madly, drowning. Great SHEETS of WATER are POURING through an upper doorway and CASCADING down like monsoon rain. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - FIREBOAT \nWe see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT \nThe weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater. Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off. \nThe building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The place is coming apart. \nTen feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main, SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS from one side of the shaft to the other. \nBrian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames. \nBrian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to drown or burn -- \n-- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A flashlight. \nIt's Stephen. \nBrian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that, Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS CRASHING into the pool beside Brian. \nSTEPHEN You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong? \nBRIAN \"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --\" \nSTEPHEN Oh shut up, huh? (grimaces) I think I broke my goddamn arm... \nBRIAN Another time, friend. \nAnd whoosh, it's gone. \nEXT. BURNED BUILDING - NIGHT \nBrian rushes up as paramedics load his brother into an ambulance. \nSTEPHEN (smiles, weak) You are such a pain in the ass... \nAs Brian jumps in with him \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT \nParamedics swarm over Stephen as the ambulance screams through the night. Brian's right there, holding his hand. \nSTEPHEN Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em... \nBRIAN I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't. \nHis brother squeezes Brian's hand, his eyes never leaving him. \nPARAMEDIC (reading EKG) Oh shit, give him some lidocaine, now. Now. \nSTEPHEN (beat) Who's your brother? \nStephen's EKG's begun to falter. The other paramedic fires off an injection into his IV. \nPARAMEDIC His pressure's fading -- push some adrenalin. \nThe EKG's become erratic. Stephen's eyes never leave Brian's. \nBRIAN Oh man, don't you die... Don't you die... \nPARAMEDIC #2 He's going south... He's gonna box damn it... \nThey put an ambo bag over Stephen's face. The eyes never leave Brian's. \nBRIAN Goddamn it don't you die now... Not now! \nThey're breathing for him now. The EKG begins shrieking. \nPARAMEDIC V-fib! \nThe paramedics begin scrambling to load the defibrillator pads on Stephen's chest. But the fireman's eyes never waver from Brian. They look into his with complete conviction, complete acceptance, And then they don't. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nThen, FADE UP TO: \nEXT. MICHIGAN AVE - DAWN \nA silent, quiet street absolutely empty of traffic. Then over the crest of Chicago's mightiest thoroughfare, creeps slowly a fire engine. It's emergency lights are on but not the siren. This engine isn't in a hurry today. \nBehind comes another fire engine. And another. Ten, twenty, all of them creeping slowly along. And behind the engines now walk firemen in their dress blues. Hundreds of them. Walking silently in step behind \nTWO COFFINS \nLoaded in the rear of Engine 17. Santos drives as Grindle, Brian, and the men of ladder company 46, walk behind. The silent procession passes under extended aerial ladders crossed like dress swords. Average people stop, take their hats off. \nEXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE - THE SILENT PROCESSION \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nTwo coffins, lying side by side, draped in the blue and white of the Chicago flag. A single fire helmet rests atop each casket. \nBrian stands at attention beside Helen. He holds the hand of Stephen's son Sean, his eyes clouded with tears as a fire dept. honor guard plays Taps. Jennifer's there, too far away to touch. \nRimgale, still wearing a head bandage, stands stiffly beside a brass bell and speaks with a voice raw and weary. \nSHADOW In the Chicago Fire Department the alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the company has returned home to quarters. We will now ring out that code to welcome home John Adcox and Stephen McCaffrey... \nWith a small hammer Rimgale rings out 3-3-5 on the bell. \nThe honor guard folds the flag covering Stephen's casket and hands it to Helen, who holds it to her breast as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nA sea of blue uniforms drifting across green as the funeral breaks up. Brian hugs Helen and Sean. Lets them go. \nEXT. CEMETERY EDGE - DAY \nRimgale's there, resting against his dept. sedan as Brian walks by, pauses, and leans on it beside him.

Try again next year. \nBRIAN No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir. \nCHIEF FITZGERALD (simmers) Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son.

TRAINING ACADEMY - GRADUATION DAY \nAnd everybody lined up at attention in dress blues. \nCHIEF FITZGERALD (at podium) Though the world changes every day, some things are truly forever: Courage, devotion, and honor in what we do. This class is a special one, for we dedicate it to the three firefighters that have fallen this year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter and Michael Petzold... (silent beat) Ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure that I certify that Candidate Class number 322, having successfully completed all academy requirements, are hereby graduated to the Chicago Fire Department. \nCandidates and their relatives CHEER and leap to their feet. Something struggles inside of Brian. He doesn't stand at first. Another Candidate, TIM, 20, looks at him strangely. So does the Academy Chief, his eyes finding Brian's. And Brian's standing slowly now, joining them... \nEXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nAn expensive one. We hear a window BREAK. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nThrough the dimness a file cabinet. An AXE SUDDENLY SLAMS into it, RIPPING it apart. Files crash to the floor. And a picture. 1970. Four young guys marlin fishing. Time of their lives. \nINT. BROWNSTONE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnd a GREY PUTTY being SLAPPED along the edges of a door. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nA split-level firemen's dive; complete with mounted axes and personalized T-shirts from various engine companies proudly declaring \"LADDER CO. 6 -- AXE FIRST, HOSE LATER\" and \"CHICAGO FD, 150 YEARS OF TRADITION UNIMPEDED BY PROGRESS\". \nTonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of recently graduated candidates. A few on the back patio have hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at balloon targets, each other, the neighbor's cat. Brian and Tim, still in their uniforms, enter from the street. Survey the scene. \nBRIAN Completely out of control. \nTIM What the hell are we waiting for? \nAs they shoulder their way inside, another CANDIDATE appears holding proudly a fistful of sealed envelopes. \nCANDIDATE Hot off the presses, guys. Station assignments. \nTim and everyone else but Brian eagerly tear into them. Brian nonchalantly shoulders up to the bar. \nBRIAN A beer, Willy! \nThe barkeep turns and smiles. \nWILLY Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey. (to candidates with hose) Hey! You break anything with that you buy it! (to Brian) Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform. \nBRIAN It's in my blood, Willy. \nThe candidates are ripping open their assignments, exclaiming to each other: \"All right! Engine 117! That's a slum! They get cookers every day!\". \"Oh no, Engine 10, that's a nice neighborhood\"... \nWilly turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a stack of business cards. \nWILLY Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was \"in your blood\". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... \"Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours...\" \nBRIAN Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need. \nWILLY Uh huh. And \"Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins\". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it? \nBRIAN Management were pin heads. \nWILLY \"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards\"? \nBRIAN Coffee sucked. \nWILLY And just this year, \"Brian's Sound Spectrum\". Your own company even. Big step. \nBRIAN I was ahead of my time. \nWILLY You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for \"Brian McCaffrey, Fireman\"... \nTim holds an envelope marked McCAFFREY out to Brian. \nTIM Aren't you even curious? \nBRIAN Engine 115, right? \nTIM (opens it, surprised) How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed. \nBRIAN Lucky guess. (winks) And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments. \nTIM You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115? \nBRIAN Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station. \n", "test1_true": "On Brian's reaction \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nA Porsche knifes through darkened streets. The DRIVER, 50, is dressed for success. Pulling up to the brownstone we saw earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes. Another day in the salt mines. \nClimbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock and opens the door. It is the last thing he will ever do. \nA THUNDERING EXPLOSION ENGULFS the stoop. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nThe place is packed now with girls flirting with the candidates, putting their helmets on, etc. The horseplay around the bar suddenly stops at the sweet sound of a SIREN. \nEXT. PUB - NIGHT \nEveryone steps outside, cocks an ear. And here it comes, the real thing, SCREECHING past in a full-tilt rush. Shouts and raised toasts. \nTIM Hey, that's my cousin's company! C'mon! Let's go! \nAs Brian turns, he suddenly confronted by an elderly LITHUANIAN WOMAN. \nBRIAN (surprised) Mrs. Viatkus... \nShe grabs his cheeks and rattles off in Lithuanian. Brian can only smile. Then two attractive jean-clad legs step up. JENNIFER. \nJENNIFER Brian. \nBRIAN (surprised) Jennifer. \nJENNIFER You're back. \nBRIAN You look great. \nJENNIFER Thanks for calling. \nBRIAN Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today. \nJENNIFER Huh. \nBRIAN So... I see you're still in the neighborhood. \nJENNIFER Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now. \nBRIAN Yeah? What have you been up to? \nJENNIFER I work for city hall. \nBRIAN Really? No kidding. \nJENNIFER What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission. \nJust then, Tim OPENS UP the hoseline, DRENCHING Brian. \nTIM Don't want you overheating, Brian! \nBrian ducks the stream and PULLS a length of hose near his feet, FLIPPING Tim. Brian JUMPS him, shuts off the hose and pins him to the pavement. \nTIM Okay okay! Uncle! \nBrian walks back toward Jennifer \nJENNIFER You've certainly matured. \nShe turns to leave. \nBRIAN Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends. \nJENNIFER I don't want to be your friend, Brian. \nAnother in a series of fire engines HOWL past. Tim grabs Brian by the shoulder. \nTIM Let's go, man! \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nBrian and Tim jump into Brian's car. They shoot blindly down the street looking for the fire engine, running down red lights or anything else that gets in their way. Brian suddenly hits the brakes, SCREECHING to a stop. They roll down their windows. Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren. \nTIM (points) That way. \nEXT. STREETS - FIRE ENGINE - NIGHT \nSCREECH. They fly around a corner, down a block, and there it is, lights flashing up ahead. Brian GUNS it, roars up alongside the fire engine.

HALL OF RECORDS \nAn Escher drawing of a place, endlessly vast racks spun around an open central core. High up, lost among its rows, Brian is going through rack after rack of dog-eared record books as Rimgale enters down below. \nBRIAN (trying to hold it together in his mind) Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...

Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight. \nBRIAN Yeah? Airtight? \nHe dumps three more reports on Rimgale. \nBRIAN I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along. \nSHADOW Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box. \nBRIAN Then who wrote the report? \nSHADOW It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection? \nBrian hands him something else. A photograph. Swayzak and the other three, posing on a fishing boat, 1970.

They STRUGGLE. \nThe figure GRABS Brian's throat. Brian PUSHES him back \n-- Against the burning wall plug. The figure SHRIEKS in pain, gets his hand on a crowbar and SLAMS Brian -- who crumples, dazed. The figure stands -- just as Rimgale TACKLES him. The figure CRASHES across a gas space heater, SNAPPING the connection off. The figure SLAMS Rimgale HARD with the crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door. \nHissss... Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the wall. A baby backdraft wagging its tail. He goes to a dazed Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and \nEXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT \nhelping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom door ajar on the far side of the house.

You're so... so goddamn useless... \nRimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger. He kicks it over and over with frustration till something finally SNAPS off. Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration. \nBRIAN So what do you want me to do? \n", "test3_true": "INT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY \nBrian's sitting alone in a chair. Finally the opposite door opens and in enters Ronald. \nRONALD Well, Mr. Life magazine. Come all this way just to say hi? \nBrian hands him a stack of murder files. \nBRIAN I'm close... but I can't get who it is... \nRONALD So you came to me... (smiles) Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all... \nAs Ronald starts to read the files \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY \nBrian still sitting there. Watching Ronald devour the statistics. The photos of charred bodies. Ronald finishes, leans back. \nRONALD Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair? \nBRIAN Who's doing this? \nRONALD Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin? \nBRIAN Then who -- \nRONALD -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story. \nBRIAN I don't have a story. \nRONALD Sure you do. \nRonald drops on the table a dog-eared copy of that 1972 LIFE magazine with Brian on the cover. \nRONALD Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there? \nBRIAN What? \nRONALD You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard -- \nBRIAN I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal. \nRONALD Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian? (Brian doesn't answer) C'mon, you promised. Be honest. (Brian just stares) Okay... Guard! \nBRIAN -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything... \nRONALD (smiles) Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen. \nBRIAN The outlets. \nRONALD That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian. \nBRIAN Trychticholorate. \nRONALD Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn? \nIn a flash, Brian suddenly reaches across and grabs Ronald by the collar. \nBRIAN Who the fuck is doing this? \nRONALD After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?... \nAnd Ronald sees something in Brian's eyes. He smiles. \nRONALD You see, our world's aren't so different... \nBrian releases Ronald. \nBRIAN (quiet) Who's doing this? \nThe arsonist smiles a creepy, horrible grin. \nRONALD Think, Brian. Who doesn't love fire, but knows it better than anyone else? Who's around trychticholorate 24 hours a day? \nA cold shock rolls through Brian as he slumps back in his chair. \nBRIAN Oh Jesus Christ... \nRONALD Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian? \nEXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - MARINA - NIGHT \nBrian climbs up onto Stephen's boat. Nobody home. He opens the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights. \nINT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT \nThere's cereal bowls in the sink, beer bottles on the table, And a stack of fire department supplies in the corner. \n"}

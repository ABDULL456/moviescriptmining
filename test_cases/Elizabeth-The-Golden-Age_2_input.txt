Their eyes meet, both aware of the current of mutual attraction.

BESS I expect I'll think of something. 
Bess hurries after the Queen. The Austrian entourage is just leaving as the Queen turns. 
ELIZABETH Mr. Raleigh. 
INT QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY 35A                                                              35A Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around the perimeter hallway, dwarfed by vast murals. 
ELIZABETH I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us? 
RALEIGH You speak like a true explorer. 
ELIZABETH I like you, Mr Raleigh. 
RALEIGH And I like you. 
She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used to such direct replies. Bess is watching them. 
ELIZABETH You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him. 
ALEIGH I have heard that. 
ELIZABETH And what have you to say about it?       R ALEIGH Reward my mission, majesty, not me. 
ELIZABETH Is the mission not the man? RALEIGH Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward. 
ELIZABETH Go on. RALEIGH I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself. 
Elizabeth stares. This is a little too close to the truth. 
ELIZABETH Now you become dull. 
35B                                                              35B EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK - DAY 
Horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying - Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride, neck and neck- 
Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the moment. 
Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length. At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk. 
RALEIGH Mine! 
Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak. 
ELIZABETH (out of breath) You have - the stronger horse. 
Y         RALEIGH ours carries the lighter load. 
ELIZABETH The Queen does not give way to others. Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse springs forward, ahead of her. RALEIGH Whoa! Whoa! (at Elizabeth, reigning in the horse) Forgive me, majesty. My horse doesn't know his place yet Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued. 
43A 
ELIZABETH Have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh? She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I'm surprised you're not married yet. RALEIGH I'm a sailor, majesty. ELIZABETH And can sailors not be lovers? RALEIGH (with a smile) 
Must lovers be husbands? 
ELIZABETH Ah, I see. You like love better 
than marriage. That I understand. 
RALEIGH 
Your majesty is not eager to be married?

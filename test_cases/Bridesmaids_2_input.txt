CUT TO: 
INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY. 
Annie looks in the classifieds. A lot say âcollege degree required.â She looks up and sees TED has walked in. 
TED Hey Annie. 
ANNIE Oh, hey Ted. You're in town. 
TED Yeah, yeah. Listen I'm going out tonight but I should be home around 11, you wanna come over? 
ANNIE Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves.

ANNIE (CONT'D) I'll see you next Monday. What time do I start? 
TIM Four a.m. Annie is a little surprised. Ti's smiling.

Annie weaves through the crowded hallway, approaches a window.

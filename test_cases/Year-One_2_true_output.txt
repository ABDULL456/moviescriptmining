INANNA Do you always follow the rules? 
ZED What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules? You-all have this bad boy complex---- She kisses him fiercely on the lips. 
INANNA Do this for me. 
ZED I'm going in. He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.

Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in supplication. He lies there with his eyes tightly shut, expecting to be vaporized any second. A long moment passes in total silence. Then he opens his eyes and looks around tentatively. The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights above. 
ZED (takes a deep breath and starts improvising) Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for-- not like-- killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy-- godliness. He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine response. Nothing comes. 
Official White                                               97. ZED                                               (cont'd) (props himself up on his 
ELBOWS) Okay, I don't know the right words-- so I'm just going to say what I have to say-- if that's all right. (waits for a response, gets none, proceeds) I know I haven't always done the right thing. Eating the fruit was bad, I know that-- and the Cain thing-- and I have done somethings with women-- I do love the ladies-- well, you probably know all that because you're watching everything-- (a thought occurs) Do you really watch everything? That's got to be a little disgusting sometimes-- but probably pretty hot, too-- 
(QUICKLY) Not that you would get off on any of it-- okay, I'm getting off the subject. Anyways, the word is you've been considering destroying this place. So I'm asking you not to-- as a personal favor. 
(NOTHING) Feel free to jump in anytime. I could use a little guidance here. Still no response. He rolls over onto his back. ZED                                               (cont'd) Look, I know you think this place is evil and it kinda is-- I see that-- but that's not everybody. There are a lot of good people, too. So what if there were, like, fifty really good people? Would you still destroy the city? 
(SILENCE) Okay, you're right, that may be a reach. How about twenty? I could probably get you twenty extremely good people if I really looked around. 
(SILENCE) How about five? Five awesome people-- including myself. I personally know at least five people worth saving. Does that sound good?

(NOTHING) Hello? A little help? Am I getting warm here? Okay, is it me? Are you punishing me for stuff I did? (an insight) Or setting me up for what I need to do. Or both! Or neither? 
(NOTHING) Could you give me some kind of a sign-- please-- anything? Zed listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a revelation. He sits up on the floor. ZED                                                           (cont'd) Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The silence? Is that it? (waits for confirmation) It is, isn't it! Just this really silent-- silence. 
(PONDERING) You're not going to tell me what to do; it's up to me to decide what's right and what's wrong-- right? Is that it? You're not going to speak to me-- you're going to speak through me? If that's right, don't say anything. (listens for a beat) Okay, I read you loud and clear. Thank you. (an afterthought) Oh, and if things don't work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the Princess had a little "carnal knowledge"? Not in an evil way or anything-- (he listens; silence) Okay! You're right, probably not a good idea. Thank you. He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way.

The doors to the Holy of Holies opens and Zed comes backing out, still bowing and muttering. Then he turns and his face falls. 
Official White                                                                                       99. The High Priest, the King, the Queen, and a dozen Temple Acolytes are staring at him in amazement. Oh stands beside the High Priest dressed just like him. 
ZED I was just looking for the bathroom. 
INANNA 
(INNOCENTLY) I told him not to go in. 
HIGH PRIEST 
(SHRIEKS) Seize them! 
OH (scared, points at Zed) Seize him! The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed. 
CAIN 
(SMIRKING) Should've invited me to the party.

In the dim torchlight, we see Zed hanging spread-eagle five feet off the ground, his arms and legs stretched out wide and tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in the stone. Oh is shackled to the wall beside him, hanging upside down. They hear the faint scream of a man being tortured somewhere deep in the prison. 
ZED I wish I was upside down. Looks fun. Oh won't talk to him. ZED                                                             (cont'd) So this is it? We're not friends anymore? After all I've done for you?

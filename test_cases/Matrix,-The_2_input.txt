And finally Agent Jones. 
Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action. 
NEO Get up, Morpheus!  Get up! 
Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down. 
Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into the adjoining room. 
He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN FIRE. 
Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room, WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving for cover. 
INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY 
Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines blister with snow-static. 
INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY 
Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes, still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close. 
And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing with fire. 
The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's BULLET TRAILS chase them. 
Morpheus strains at his handcuffs. 
The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD, RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER. 
FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping the handcuffs, starting for the window. 
Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open bedroom door. 
AGENT SMITH Nooo! 
He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect line. 
For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of chalk. 
And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet buries itself in his leg -- 
Knocking him off balance. 
NEO He won't make it. 
Morpheus lunges, out of control -- 
As Neo spins, every move a whip crack -- 
Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar. 
Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the wide blue empty space -- 
Flying for a moment. 
The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord attached to a machine. 
As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other on a seemingly magnetic course until -- 
They collide. 
Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs, scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation, finding hold and clinging. 
Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, falling down -- 
The ground deliriously distant -- 
As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist. 
NEO Gotcha! 
Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away. 
As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine. 
He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he aims at something only he can see: the oil line. 
PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood. 
TRINITY Shit-shit-no! 
Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE. 
NEO Oh fuck. 
Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the nearest building. 
Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the machine above them begin to fall. 
The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow while -- 
The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings. 
Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic fall over the nearest roof where -- 
Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach himself but -- 
The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof like a setting sun -- 
The coils of slack snap taught -- 
Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as --

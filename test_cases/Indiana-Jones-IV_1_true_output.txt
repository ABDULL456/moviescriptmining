ELDERLY WOMAN May God help them. 
CUT TO: 
THE CASTLE DOORS. 
Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons, serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window. The candle still FLICKERS. 
A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle stairs. 
Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches. 
Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS, holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors. 
INT. CASTLE 
Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms. 
HENNESEY It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could a human bein' survive?... 
Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW. 
Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT. MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac. 
INDIANA This guy's got one hell of an ego. 
MACGOWAN Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say 'e walks the moors every midnight... others claim e's been dead for years... 
Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance. Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their pistols. They FOLLOW. 
INT. ROOM 
A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room in ORANGE LIGHT. 
Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY... 
There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh has SOBSIDED. 
MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE! 
MACGOWAN Hennesey?... Hennesey?... 
GALBRAITH (panic) 'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a second ago... Standin' right beside me!... 
THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM. 
INT. CASTLE 
Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES. MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the others to FOLLOW. 
INT. BASEMENT 
A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN with their every move. 
MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing! FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY. MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING. 
MACGOWAN Thanks for catchin' me. 
INDIANA I'd rather be catchin' trout. 
They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large, MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS. There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the ringing bell is much LOUDER down here. 
Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the liquid. He TASTES. 
INDIANA Interesting blood type... 
The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES. 
INDIANA Cabernet sauvignon. 1897. 
Indy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith CRIES OUT. 
GALBRAITH (pointing OFF SCREEN) Look! 
Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS. Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening. He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind. 
BEHIND THE DOOR 
A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!

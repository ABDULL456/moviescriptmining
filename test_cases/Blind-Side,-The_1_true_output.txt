MISS SUE Have you decided yet, Michael? 
MICHAEL No, Miss Sue. 
MISS SUE But you like Tennessee? (off his nod) It's a good school. Not at the academic level of Ole Miss but they do have an outstanding science department. You know one of the things they're famous for? (he shakes his head) They work with the FBI to study the effects of the soil on decomposing body parts. Michael is a bit lost. 
MISS SUE (CONT'D) When they find a body the police want to know how long they've been dead. The fine department at Tennessee helps them. They have lots of body parts - arms, legs, hands - from hospitals and medical schools. Do you know where they store them? (Michael shakes his head) Right underneath the football field. Michael's eyes widen a bit. 
MISS SUE (CONT'D) So, while it's fine and dandy to have 100,000 fans cheering for you, the bodies you should be worried about are right underneath the turf. Set to poke up through the ground and grab you. She raises a clawed hand (think "CARRIE") to make her point. Michael is completely freaked out by this. 
MISS SUE (CONT'D) But it's your decision where you play football. Don't let me influence you.

Ole Miss Coach, ED ORGERON, talks with Leigh Anne. 
LEIGH ANNE Congrats on gettin' hired, Coach. 
ED ORGERON Thank yew, Ma'am. Ole Miss is my dream job. 
LEIGH ANNE Coach 0, you're coming a little late to the party but we're diehard Rebels so I'm gonna give you a frickin' road map, okay? 
ED ORGERON Yes 'm. 
LEIGH ANNE LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's going to the NFL. So when he comes for his visit to Ole Miss, don't take him to some titty bar and give him tequila shots. He'll have nightmares for weeks. Feed him Italian - he likes Fettucine Alfredo - take him to a movie - but not Chainsaw massacre because he'll just cover his eyes - and put him to bed by ten. You got it? 
ED ORGERON Yes'm. What about Tennessee?

{"train": "SAILOR #1 So he owes us nine hundred dollars. \nNICK Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him. \nSAILOR #1 That can be arranged. In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note. Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE. \nNICK I like it. Very to the point. Well... See you guys this afternoon! The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor. As they turn to go and Nick closes the door... \nLEFTY (V.O.) I might have to kill myself. \nEXT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY \nIn the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes. \nNICK (V.O.) I hope you have a good reason. Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars. \nLEFTY My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy. \nNICK I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just waging psychological warfare. \nLEFTY Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache. \nNICK Maybe your just not wacking off enough. As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance... \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air. \nLEFTY (O.S.) So, I've been taping my pecker to my right leg at night. \nNICK (V.O.) In case you haven't heard, Lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft. \nLEFTY (O.S.) Then I look at this issue of Better Homes and Gardens that has a girl that looks just like Millie until it gets good and hard. I think it's starting to straighten out. \nNICK Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor? \nLEFTY (O.S.) Are you kidding? It would kill them to know that I even get hard-ons. \nNICK Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out. \nLEFTY (O.S.) True. What if I shove it up the wrong hole? Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction. \nNICK (V.O.) Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there. \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nJERRY Nick, you little shit, get down here! Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs. \nESTELLE Nick, do you know anything about this? She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood. \nNICK Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want their money back. I guess there was a banana in the transmission. \nJERRY You tell them when I was coming back? \nNICK Now why would I do that? Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence. \nESTELLE What are you going to do, Jerry? \nJERRY I think I'll go get the Lincoln washed. \nESTELLE You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars? \nJERRY Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first. I'm in the right. And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door. They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps. \nNICK Oh, look. The sailors are here. Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses. \nJERRY Get rid of them! And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. Jerry bolts up the stairs. \nNICK Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you are in the right. \nINT. ESTELLE'S HOME - CONTINUOUS \nThey manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield. The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets. \nSAILOR #1 Sixty-three lousy dollars. \nJERRY That's my life savings! One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers. \nINT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nNick sleeps on a pull out cot. He bolts upright at the banging, his hair going in all directions. \nMRS. SAUNDERS (O.S.) It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders. Church services begin at seven fifteen prompt. Donuts will be served. Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers. Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen door and takes off. \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nNick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded path. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nThe serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well- attended congregation in the meeting hall. WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop. A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath. \nLight falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor like something out of a Fran\u00e7ois Boucher painting. \nNICK (V.O.) The moment I see her I know the Gods, while having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing pimples, had put me here for a purpose. My heart palpitates. My mind races. I get an instant \nT.E. Super:                (Thundering Erection) Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused smile, almost flirtatious. Nick grins back. \nSHEENI Your robe is open. Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes into a flustered march down the path. \nINT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY \nAn austere   cement shed with three dripping shower heads and no privacy   walls. Nick lathers up under the spray. Jerry appears in   the foreground and removes his robe. He goes to the shower   head next to Nick and turns it on. Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits. He starts warbling rock lyrics. \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nNick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence. Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps. \nSHEENI Hel-lo, Excitable Boy. \nESTELLE Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders. \nNICK Hello. \nESTELLE Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store. I've offered her your help in carrying her bags. Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk. \nNICK Thanks a pantsful. \nEXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY \nA dusty road. Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. He watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle. Full lips that cry out to be kissed. \nNICK You don't have to go to services? \nSHEENI No. Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents I have converted to atheism. Fortunately my brother, Paul, paved the way for such transgressions. \nNICK Paul is an atheist too? \nSHEENI Buddhist, I believe, though we have not seen him in some time. I myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage. \nNICK Likewise. \nSHEENI Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father I think might be rather dim. \nNICK Jerry and I share no blood links of any kind. As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in chorus. \nNICK Sounds rather zealous. \nSHEENI Yes, even though I am no longer a believer I always found the services wonderfully aerobic. \nNICK You could say the same thing about sex. Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently. \nSHEENI Nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures? \nNICK I hardly ever think about sex. \nSHEENI Really? I think about it all the time. It's the hormones at work, you know. She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion. \nEXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY \nThey regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home. \nNICK Wow. A second floor. \nNICK Please do. She takes a dramatic pause. \nSHEENI RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/ Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void. She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression. \nNICK (V.O.) If that's poetry, I'm a turkey scrotum. \nINT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT \nTIME LAPSE of Nick thrashing about in bed. During this montage there is the constant ticking of a clock. \nNICK (V.O.) Here is an hour by hour account of the worst night of my life. Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers. \nNICK (V.O.) 1 AM. I decide it is just a case of puppy love and look forward to the interesting women I shall meet in the future. \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT \nA light comes on in the window. \nINT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nNick at the dining table, writing a note. \nNICK (V.O.) 2 AM. I conclude the only way out is suicide. I begin to pen a poignant suicide note. Sheeni will see Trent for the shallow pedant he is and always treasure my memory. \nJERRY (O.S.) Turn off the damn light! \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT \nNick paces about back and forth in the yard. \nNICK (V.O.) 3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for any of the manly, violent means of suicide. I shall swallow sleeping pills. Where to get them, though? \nINT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT \nNick is in bed jerking off. The trailer shakes despite his best efforts. \nNICK (V.O.) 4 AM. I can not die an inviolate virgin. Either I find a way to get laid soon or suicide gets postponed until after high school. \nJERRY (O.S.) You wanna beat your meat, go outside! \nINT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY \nNick in the shower going to town on his T.E. \nNICK (V.O.) 5 AM. It will be too painful to see Sheeni again. I shall ask Mom if we can cut our vacation short and return to Oakland. \nINT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nNick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a manic insomniac. \nNICK (V.O.) 6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see Sheeni again! \nINT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY \nThe door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts, an I'M SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt, and tennis shoes. Sheeni stands in the door. Sleep-fogged eyes. \nNICK Good morning! \nSHEENI Nick? God what time is it? \nNICK Seven o'clock. How about breakfast? \nSHEENI (smiling with endearment) Come back in two hours. I'm going on a hike. You can join me if you'd like. She closes the door. \nSuper:     One hour fifty seven minutes later A knock on the door. Sheeni opens it to reveal... Nick, dressed the same. Sheeni wears Khakis, red bandanna neckerchief, and an Australian bush hat. She looks like the world's most desirable Girl Scout. She examines Nick's attire. \nSHEENI Nick, where are your hiking boots, water bottle, provisions, survey maps and compass? \nNICK Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder. \nSHEENI Okay, but I have no plans to baby any slackers. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nSheeni leads the way up hill. Nick clutches his cramped stomach with one hand, his journal in the other. He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her hiking shorts. \nESTELLE Jerry! Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to murder the trucker in his sleep. \nINT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER \nNick lies below us on the cot, unable to sleep with the anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity. \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT/DAY \nAnother perfect California summer dawn, a pale moon lingering in the blue morning sky. Nick emerges from My Green Haven in his robe. He starts off down the path. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nThe trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the distant sound of dogs barking. \nEXT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY \nNick approaches the shower building. As he nears, the sound of water running can be heard from the ladies' side. \nINT. PUBLIC REST ROOM (WOMEN'S SIDE) - DAY \nThe women's side has real stalls and privacy doors. Nick spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form showers, obscured by tacky stained glass. He kicks off his slippers. Hangs his robe on a hook. He approaches the stall. Flashing super:       Thundering Erection He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray. He embraces her. Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs. Saunders! She looks up startled. Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered. She hurls a bar of soap. The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape. \nMRS. SAUNDERS \nRAPE! RAAAAAPE! Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches out and pulls Nick up. \nSHEENI Get out quick! Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats. \nINT. CAFE - DAY \nNick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him at the table. \nNICK Should I go to the sheriff's now? \nSHEENI No. I managed to convince Mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign. \nNick nods thankfully. \nNICK Say, where were you anyway?   We said five minutes to six. \nSHEENI I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are always discreetly late. It's expected of us. \nNICK Swell. And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape. \nSHEENI Don't complain. At least you got to shower with a naked woman. (licking donut powder off her fingers) What are your plans today? \nNICK My parents want to go to Middletown. Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave. \nSHEENI I should like to come with you, Nick. The more time we spend together the better. I fear when you leave we might never see each other again. Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought. \nINT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY \nSheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks. Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of his thigh. As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake. \nEXT. GEEZER'S MANOR - DAY \nEstelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it might not make the trip back. In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard. \nJERRY What's your cash price? \nGEEZER I said in the ad. Thousand dollars firm. \nJERRY Thousand, huh? That must be with a guarantee. \nGEEZER As is, where she is. \nJERRY I don't know. Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard. The roof probably needs work. I couldn't go above eight hundred. The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and goes inside the RV to inspect. \nESTELLE (O.S.) There are mouse droppings in all the closets, Jerry. \nGEEZER I might take nine fifty. \nJERRY Nine hundred. Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming \nPUPPIES. She brings one of them over. \nNICK How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side? \nSHEENI (matter of fact) Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to you. \nNick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register. \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nJerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln. Estelle loads up the trunk. \nESTELLE Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni. It's time to hit the road. Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick the dog. Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. \nSHEENI (whispering in his ear) Don't forget, darling. Red wine and Consumer Reports. She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard. He grabs her and kisses her deeply. Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off. \nINT. LINCOLN - DAY \nNick gets into the back seat with Albert. The dog whimpers. Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both. \nJERRY Okay. Back to civilization! He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert slobbers all over Nick. Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror, waving in the road. \nNICK (V.O.) I have a tall mountain to climb, with many treacherous glaciers still to cross, but finally, I have obtained a stamped entry visa to the paradise that lay beyond. Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the horizon. \nNICK (V.O.) In short... I have a very real prospect for getting laid. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nEXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nThe Lincoln and RV slow to a stop outside the home. \nI/E. LINCOLN - DAY They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used to be. Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction. \nJERRY You see that, Babe. They caved. \nEXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nJerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry decides it's parked. There comes a woman's scream from inside the house. \nINT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nJerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy. \nNICK I guess they didn't cave after all. Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle. \nJERRY Boy, everything's complete. There's even water in the windshield washer. \nESTELLE How did they ever get it in here? My front door can't be more than three feet wide. \nJERRY Looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it. \nESTELLE But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that! Jerry slams down the hood. \nJERRY Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy. \nEXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nA cab pulls up in front of the house and Nick's sister, Joanie gets out of the back. She tips the driver, and as she crosses the front yard, gawks at the RV sitting in the drive. \nINT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY \nNick's door is ajar. Nick pulls up his trousers and comes into the hall. He listens to the voices downstairs. \nSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS He comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight of his mother and sister staring up at him. \nESTELLE Nick, your sister came all the way from LA for a weekend visit! Nick and Joanie meet eyes. She lifts a quizzical eyebrow. \nNICK Stellar. \nINT. ESTELLE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nAlbert chews on Jerry's sock under the table. \nJERRY Can someone do something about the mutt? The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor. \nESTELLE I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room? \nNICK And how is Trent? Not too suicidal I hope. \nINT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY \nSheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl. WE INTERCUT. \nSHEENI Of course, he was disconsolate, but we talked all day and he's come to see this as an opportunity for growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will. \nNICK Nor I him. I wish him all the best. \nSHEENI His parents are sending him to a French speaking boarding school this year. He's sure to get along there. So how is my darling Albert? \nNICK Well, though he's taken a disliking to Jerry. \nSHEENI And you, Nickie? How are you? \nNICK I regret, Love of My Life, my father has lost his job and I will now be forced to go to public school. \nSHEENI How unfortunate. What did he do? \nNICK He's a writer - sort of. He writes advertising copy. \nSHEENI Really? (pensive beat) Nick, I suggest we look at your father's firing as a blessing in disguise. \nNICK How so? \nSHEENI I propose we get your father a job here in Ukiah and you can come and live with him. \nNICK Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you. \nSHEENI Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know Progressive Plywood is looking for an assistant editor. It would be perfect for your father. Nick furrows his brow with skepticism. \nNICK I had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines. \nSHEENI The owner is the father of a friend of mine. \nNICK Anyone I know? \nSHEENI Okay, it's Trent's father. So what? \nNICK So why would Trent want to help my father move to Ukiah? \nSHEENI I told you, darling. Trent harbors you no ill will. I will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter. \nNICK Very well, but I don't see how I am to live with him. My mother values my indentured servitude. \nSHEENI You must influence her to send you away. I feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part. \nNICK What do you want me to do? \nSHEENI I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible. You must emulate James Dean... CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS. \nSHEENI ...You must be bad, Nickie. Be very, very bad. A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes. \nNICK I will, darling. I will! And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell. \nINT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJoanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without a Cause through the windshield. \nEstelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her face and a police officer, LANCE WESCOTT, 45, with a flattop, watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy clubs. \nESTELLE Kids? This is Officer Lance Wescott. He has some bad news. After a beat, Nick rolls down the window. \nLANCE Your mother's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas. He's dead. Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to Lance. \nESTELLE Will they be sending his belongings? \nLANCE Uh... I'm afraid they've already been sent. To his wife. Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother. \nESTELLE His... His wife?!? She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance Wescott's arms. \nLANCE There, there, Ma'am. It's going to be okay. Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume watching the movie. Estelle's cries of despair become... \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJoanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs. Estelle stands over them. \nESTELLE What the in God's name has gotten into you?!? Jerry paid good money for that trailer! \nNICK And just what makes you so sure it was me? \nESTELLE Who the hell else would write such a thing? Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE. \nESTELLE And just how do you explain this? She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey. \nNICK That's Lacey. \nESTELLE And just who the hell is Lacey? \nNICK Dad's girlfriend. Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and envy. \nESTELLE His girlfriend? What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend? \nJOANIE C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures like that to... \nESTELLE When I want your opinion on raising my child, I'll ask for it. (to Nick; morbidly \nCURIOUS) And what's this Lacey tart like? \nNICK Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad. Super:             (True) \nNICK She likes to sit on Dad's lap while he eats and blow in his ear. Super:           (Not true) \nNICK And she calls him \"Thunder Rod\" and he calls her \"Sugar Puss.\" Super:       (True; believe it or not) At this point Estelle has turned bright red. \nESTELLE You are confined to your room until school starts, you sick pervert. She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement. \nNICK I wish I was leaving with you tonight. \nJOANIE Your day will come. I never thought mine would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up? \nNICK I wish. Did you really take a posture class? \nJOANIE Implants. I wanted them all my life. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \nA knock on the door. Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the headphones off his ears. \nNICK Hey, Lefty. \nLEFTY What's with your mom, Nick? She gave me the third degree just to come up here. \nNICK I vandalized Jerry's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey. \nLEFTY Well, good thing I stole this from the bookstore then. Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets. \nLEFTY I was reading it all last night. Boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than I thought. Did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole? \nNICK You lie. \nLEFTY No way, man. Here, I got the page marked. Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them flip through the manual. \nNICK Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try this on Sheeni. I think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other. They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay. \nLEFTY Are we really supposed to be that... uh... big? \nNICK I think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis. \nLEFTY Maybe we should compare. \nNICK Perhaps we should. Just for the sake of research. Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet. They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets a hint of concern in his expression. Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for the curvature. The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her, pants around their ankles. \nESTELLE \nPERVERTS! She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way. \nESTELLE \nFRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS! \nEXT. OAKLAND - DAY \nNick walks Albert down the sidewalk. Lefty crosses the street to him and they walk together. \nNICK Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'? \nLEFTY You'll never believe who called me, Nick. Millie Filbert! \nNICK What?!? Why? \nLEFTY I dunno. She just called and asked if I wanted to hang out tonight. I didn't want to ask why. I need to find someplace for us to get it on. Albert squats to poop in someone's yard. The boys pause to wait for him. \nNICK You can use my house if you want. \nLEFTY Really? \nNICK Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to a movie and I'm planning on stealing Jerry's trailer and torching it in a parking lot, so you'll have the whole house to yourself. \nLEFTY Right on. Albert finishes his business and they resume walking. \nNICK So where you headed anyway? \nLEFTY Dr. Browerly's office. My parents are making me see a shrink now. \nNICK He asking lots of weird questions? \nLEFTY You bet your left nut he is! He asked if I had any lustful thoughts toward my sister. \nNICK What did you tell him? \nLEFTY I told him about beating off once with her brassiere. \nNICK What did you tell him that for? \nLEFTY You don't know what it's like. I think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth. \nNICK Sounds like a professional. He must be very expensive. \nLEFTY I wouldn't know. The bill goes to your house. \nNICK My mom is paying for your therapy? \nLEFTY I guess so. It was your cyclops I was staring at. \nNICK Yes, but it was your idea. \nLEFTY That's true. Gee, maybe I am gay. \nNICK Don't be retarded. We were doing research for our girlfriends. \nLEFTY Oh, right. I forgot. That's a relief. So you'll leave the door open? \nNICK Yeah, just don't blow your load on my sheets. \nLEFTY Thanks a pantsful, Nick. \nNICK Don't mention it. See ya, Lefty. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \nNick hunches over his desk doing homework, headphones over his ears. Estelle knocks and enters. Nick pulls the headphones down around his neck. \nESTELLE Lance and I are walking down to the movie theater. There's TV dinners in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your father got a job in Ukiah. \nNICK Mom? Do you think it might be a good idea if I moved in with him? \nESTELLE Nick, that just wouldn't work. I depend on that child support money to eat. \nNICK But shouldn't you depend on the child support money for, you know... child support? \nESTELLE Watch your smart mouth. She slams the door. \nEXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nNICK (V.O.) The plan is simple. Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of the Lincoln. Nick's behind the wheel, backing up the car. \nWe find Nick waiting in the drive with a pile of suitcases beside him. \nLEFTY (O.S.) Psst. Nick. Nick finds Lefty lurking in the shrubs that divide his mother's lawn from the neighbor's. He limps to his friend. \nNICK I was wondering what happened to you. Did you get to blow your wad? \nLEFTY No. I did not get to blow my wad. \nNICK Did you get interrupted? \nLEFTY No. Worse. \nNICK What's worse than being interrupted? \nLEFTY Millie is a lesbian. \nNICK \nWHAT?!? \nLEFTY The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was gay too. \nNICK Sorry, man. I didn't have a great night either. \nLEFTY Well, I dunno what you're gonna do, but I'm giving suicide serious consideration this time. \nNICK Or you could just fake it and then hide out in Ukiah with me. Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity. \nLEFTY Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks a pantsful, Nick. A pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out of sight. The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's \nBMW. The driver's side window rolls down to reveal Nick's dad. Lacey leans over George's seat to wave at Nick through the window and show him some of her cleavage. \nLACEY Hiya, Nick! \nNICK Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad. The trunk pops open. \nNICK Is there any way I could sit up front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's boyfriend beat me pretty badly. \nGEORGE Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots get the back seat. \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT Nick is in the back, crowded in by his belongings and Albert. They ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the fire, where FIRE FIGHTERS sift through the ash. \nGEORGE My God. Look what you've done. Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat. They share a smile. \nEXT. UKIAH - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nMorning peers over the distant hills. \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY \nThe BMW pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood rectangle perched on cement blocks. Aluminum windows. A swamp cooler on the shallow-pitched roof. They all emerge from the car. \nGEORGE Go ahead and bring your stuff inside. Lacey and I need a nap. C'mon, Sugar Puss. Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home. As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction. \nNICK (V.O.) What a competitive asshole. \nEXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY \nNick reaches the door and gently knocks. But it's Sheeni's ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick sternly. \nNICK Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available? \nMR. SAUNDERS She most certainly is not. As a matter of fact, we've banned you from her life, Nick Twisp. \nNICK Excuse me? \nMR. SAUNDERS Trent Preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter, but that you're not even mentally-handicapped, and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body. \nNICK That rat-fink-fuck! \nMR. SAUNDERS You watch your language. This is a Christian home. We're sending Sheeni to Les \u00c9cole des Arts and Literatures in Santa Cruz. \nNICK Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable without me. We're in love. The ogre snorts in condescending amusement. \nMR. SAUNDERS Then I guess it's a good thing Trent is going there too. She'll have someone to console her. And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and forth. \nNICK Hello, Paul. How did you know my name? \nPAUL We've met. \nNICK No we haven't. \nPAUL In a previous life. \nNICK Oh. Paul begins rolling a joint. \nPAUL Nice fire in Berkeley. \nNICK Did Sheeni tell you that was me? \nPAUL She didn't have to. \nNICK Why? Was I an arsonist in a previous life? \nPAUL No. But Sheeni was. \nNICK My God. What did she burn? \nPAUL Men. Men and boys. Paul hands the joint out to Nick. He regards it dubiously. \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY \nAn empty hallway. PSYCHEDELIC SOUND plays. Nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the hall. He breaststrokes through the air toward us. \nINT. GEORGE AND LACEY'S ROOM - DAY \nHe passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet touching carpet. He looks into the mirror and finds Fran\u00e7ois lounging on the bed behind him. \nNICK My God, Fran\u00e7ois! What was Paul smoking? \nFRANCOIS Shut up and go with it. Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing Lacey's lingerie. Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs. He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E. He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head. He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg movements. \nAs he backs up we can see that George is watching him from the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly. \nGEORGE What the... What the hell? Nick gives a startled jump. \nLACEY Is..? Is that my bra? \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - NIGHT \nNick sits at the table, considerably more clothed and sober. George works on a jug of zin. \nGEORGE We're calling that fruitcake display strike one. Two more strikes and it's back to Oakland. Nick nods. The front door opens and MRS. CRAMPTON enters with Safeway bags of her own. Dwayne follows close behind her. \nDWAYNE Hey, Nick! Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet. \nNICK Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you doing here? \nDWAYNE Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be roommates! Ain't that zinky? Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing after the dog. \nMRS. CRAMPTON Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here and take yer sleepin' pill. You must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy. I don't serve two shifts. \nNICK Uh... Dad? What's going on? \nGEORGE Mrs. Crampton's our new housekeeper. I'm renting out the spare room to her seeing as her camper has been deemed unfit for human habitation. \nNICK What about Dwayne? \nGEORGE He's bunking with you. \nNICK Dad! \nGEORGE You working on strike two? Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone takes their seats at the table. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNick tries to shut out the sound of Dwayne getting into the creaky bed behind him. \nDWAYNE Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed with me? It'll be tons warmer. \nNICK No thank you, Dwayne. A knock at the door. Lacey enters. \nVIJAY So how is Sheeni? \nNICK I don't know. She sent me this letter. But it's in French. \nVIJAY Shall I translate it for you? \nNICK You speak French? \nVIJAY I speak French, English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu. \nLEFTY That must come in handy. Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance. Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud. \nVIJAY Dear, Nick... \nINT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - SUNSET \nIn Nick's imagination, Sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean. \nSHEENI (V.O.) ...I am writing you from my room in Santa Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding school has proven to be a welcome liberation as well as... \nINT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nSHEENI (V.O.) ...a stimulating experience which I am now not so quick to change. Sheeni slips into a nightgown as other GIRLS walk around scantily clad behind her. \nSHEENI Perhaps you should consider learning French and enrolling. That said... \nINT. \u00c9COLE DES ARTS ET LITT\u00c9RATURE - HALLWAY - DAY \nSheeni chats up a gathering of HANDSOME BOYS in the hall. They regard her lustfully. \nSHEENI (V.O.) ...English cannot be spoken on campus even if you are hemorrhaging from an accidental limb amputation. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - DAY \nSHEENI (V.O.) I have made friends with the head of the girls' basketball team. Her name is Heather, and despite her popularity, she is saving herself for college boys. HEATHER, a slender giantess, poses with the other members of the BASKETBALL TEAM for a yearbook photo. \nINT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nSHEENI (V.O.) I have an interesting roommate from New York named Taggarty... TAGGARTY, short dark hair, intense green eyes, Manhattan sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness, snaps a Polaroid of a sleepy BOY. \nSHEENI (V.O.) She has already slept with seventeen boys and hopes to rack up fifty before leaving here. Taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with Polaroids. She writes the boy's grade (C-) beneath his image. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nThe distant figure on the windsurf board can only be Trent. \nSHEENI (V.O.) Trent has taken up windsurfing and has been designated target number one by all the girls. I am still very angry at him for the betrayal but he claims he wants to mend our friendship. The figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching BIKINI-CLAD GIRLS gasp in horror. \nSHEENI (V.O.) I guess we shall see. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nVIJAY \n(READING) All in all, I'm happy and look forward to further growth in this rich, intellectual environment. Vijay sets down the letter. Nick waits a beat, staring in disbelief. \nNICK That's it? Nothing else about me? Vijay picks up the letter again. \nVIJAY Oh yes... Love to you and Albert. (setting down the letter) Who's Albert? \nNICK Albert is our dog. This is a disaster. What the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the relationship? \nVIJAY I don't know, but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited. I wonder if she's made it with a Hindu yet. \nLEFTY Heather sounds like a babe. You think if I grew a beard I'd pass for college age? \nNICK I've got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible. If I don't Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she doesn't like me. \nLEFTY And then he'll probably fuck her in other ways. Did you know you're supposed to put your pinkie in a girl's bumhole, Vijay? \nNICK Will you shut up and help me out? \nLEFTY Sorry, Nick. What should we do? \nNICK I suggest we steal my father's BMW and take a trip to Santa Cruz. Vijay, you'll have to be our translator. \nINT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink. \nVIJAY I am in a state of sexual frenzy. What is your plan? \nNICK We drape a blanket over the lower bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a condom. I slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four. \nVIJAY What if they don't go for it? \nNICK They'll go for it. You can cut the sexual tension in that room with a knife. \nINT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nSHEENI Don't be silly, darling. Not with others in the room. (leaning in to whisper) We must wait until everyone falls asleep. Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed. As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor, they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky. \nTAGGERTY Goodnight boys. Do you need the light on to take off your clothes? \nNICK No. (flipping off the light) We can find our zippers in the dark. \nA beat of BLACKNESS. Then a light tap at the door. There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed. She cracks the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a MALE SHADOW gets cast across the two boys on the floor. Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male shadow are whispering to each other. After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges into BLACKNESS once again. Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back into bed as if nothing happened. \nNICK Sheeni? \nSHEENI Yes, Nick? \nNICK Was that the matron? \nSHEENI No. Beat. \nNICK Then who was it? \nSHEENI It was Trent. Beat. \nNICK Did you say it was Trent? \nSHEENI Yes. He came to discuss our friendship. I told him now was not the time. \nNICK So where is Trent now? \nSHEENI I assume he went back to the boys' dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries. Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser. Fran\u00e7ois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson. \nFRAN\u00c7OIS Now is our chance. \nNICK Chance for what? \nFRAN\u00c7OIS To confront our nemesis. We must go to the boys' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps. \nNICK I suppose we should at least get a look at him. To see what we're dealing with. \nFRAN\u00c7OIS Very well. (stubbing out his \nCIGARETTE) You see what we are dealing with... and zen I wll deal wiz it. And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare. \nINT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nNick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a whindbreaker. He creeps down the hall. \nEXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT \nThe school SECURITY VAN crawls by in the background, a searchlight sweeping the grounds. The moment it is out of sight, Nick darts from the bushes of the girls' dorm and races across the campus to the boys' dorm. \nINT. BOYS DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nNick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors. He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts the names TRENT and ED. Nick knocks on the door. It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in a pajama pants. This is ED SOLOMON. \nNICK Trent? \nED No. Who the hell are you? \nNICK I am Nick Twisp. \nED Oh, so you're Nick. \nNICK Is Trent here? \nINT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nNick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking. Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk. He watches the moon lit forms thumping together. He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk. He moves toward her. She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him. \nNICK Sheeni? \nSHEENI Yes, darling. \nNICK Was Trent here? \nSHEENI Yes, Nick. Nick hangs his head. \nSHEENI But I sent him away again. Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration. \nSHEENI Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me. \nShe smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into her bed as... The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight. \nMATRON Q'est que c'est passer ici?!? Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically. \nEXT. GIRLS' DORM - NIGHT \nThe boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves, cheering the boys' escape. Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up. Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the Vietnamese Army. They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking. Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as Nick peels out. INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the night. \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT Lefty lets out a holler of joy. \nLEFTY I did it three times! Two long ones and a quickie. \nNICK Great. Just great. How about you, Vijay? \nVIJAY It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones? \nNICK That brand was top-rated by Consumers. \nVIJAY Well, she's safe. No organism could penetrate those walls. \nNICK You think the girls are in trouble? \nVIJAY They will likely notify their parents. Perhaps even expel them. \nNICK That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah. The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge. \nEXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT \nThe rain is coming down again. Nick shivers in his underwear. Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched. \nVIJAY What will we do? \nNICK Well, we can't stay in the car. Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent driver's license. \nLEFTY But we have no money! \nVIJAY I have no shoes! I'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin! \nEXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT \nA couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone. There is ringing on the other end. \nESTELLE (V.O.) Hello? \nNICK (into phone) Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake you, but I'm hoping you'll help your only son. Especially seeing as it would really piss off Dad. A long beat. \nESTELLE (V.O.) Where are you, Nick? \nEXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT \nThe three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker. A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash twice and Nick runs out into the road. \nPOV TRUCK DRIVER Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities. The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down at our three waylaid adventurers. \nWALLY Pardon me. But is one of you Nick Twisp? The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing. \nNICK Yeah. I'm Nick. \nWALLY I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your mom's. Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission. \nNICK I'm sixteen, Dad. \nGEORGE Shut your pie hole! (turning to Lacey and \nPAUL) That boy is an underaged minor. I'm going to have you arrested and charged with child molesting. \nLACEY Don't be an idiot, George. No one was naked. \nGEORGE When you get out of prison, you will both have to register as sex offenders. You will never be able to get a decent job again. \nPAUL I've never had a decent job. I don't think I'd want one. \nLACEY Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick up the rest of my things tomorrow. \nGEORGE Not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe. \nLACEY I paid you all your money! \nGEORGE Not the extra charges. She gets up in his face. \nLACEY Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges. As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders back toward his room. \nGEORGE (O.S.) Using bad language in front of a minor. The judge will hear about that too. Nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him. SWISH TO... Dwayne playing Nintendo naked. He looks over his shoulder. \nDWAYNE What's all the ruckus about? \nNICK Dwayne! Please cover yourself. \nDWAYNE You wanna play Nintendo all night? \nNICK Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go to sleep. Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed. Dwayne just sits there on the floor, naked as a clam. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - THE DEAD OF NIGHT \nNICK (V.O.) A strange night. I dreamed of wrestling for what seemed like hours with an amorous walrus... Nick squirms with an amorphous blob, they wrestle against the red abstract background. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - MORNING \nNick's bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor, where his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile. \nNICK (V.O.) There is only one explanation: I have been Dwayned. A pillow whacks across a blubbery face. \nNICK Wake up! I know what you were doing last night, you disgusting beast! \nDWAYNE Don't be mad, Nick. I like you. Dwayne throws off his sheets. Nick shudders at the sight. ...which is when Mrs. Crampton barges in.. \nMRS. CRAMPTON Boys, time to get-- AHH! Dwayne! Where's yer pajamas? \nDWAYNE Nick made me take them off, Mom. He took off his too. \nMRS. CRAMPTON You leave my son alone. Don't go co'rupt him with yer nastiness! \nNICK We weren't doing anything, Mrs. Crampton. It was just hot last night. \nMRS. CRAMPTON If you get hot, boys, open a window. Don't go takin' off yer pajamas. That's nasty. \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY \nNick dials on the phone. Behind him, Dwayne eats breakfast, cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair. \nTAGGARTY (V.O.) Bonjour. \nNICK Taggarty? It's Nick. \nINT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nTaggarty's at her desk. Her thick rimmed glasses almost make her look studious. WE INTERCUT. \nTAGGARTY Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to talk to Sheeni. \nNICK If you please. Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait. \nTAGGARTY It's your would-be-lover. Sheeni sleepily takes the phone. \nSHEENI Nick? \nA view of the thin birch walls. We come to rest on Nick, shivering under an electric blanket. There's a blob of snot on his upper-lip. \nNICK (V.O.) No matter. Tomorrow I will be reunited with My Everlasting Love. And I will not be stopped. Not by an outbreak of the plague, nor by a cruel return of the ice-age. Not even by the Gods themselves. \nEXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY \nThe velvet voices of the Rat Pack come from the home. Nick emerges from the Camper wrapped in the electric blanket. He scurries into the house. \nINT. BATHRROOM - DAY \nNick showers. Nick straightens his Garcia tie in the mirror. He applies hair gel. Nick examines the whitehead on his brow. He pinches and a glob of puss smacks the mirror. \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - HALLWAY - DAY \nHe emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner into the... \nLIVING ROOM where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone. \nNICK Twisp residence. \nESTELLE (V.O.) Nick? \nNICK Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up? \nESTELLE (V.O.) Nickie, I have some bad news! Nick sighs. \nNICK Okay. I'm ready. What is it? \nESTELLE (V.O.) I'm afraid Lance and Wally got into a terrible row. He tried to arrest Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw. \nNICK What's the bad news? \nESTELLE (V.O.) The Berkeley police know you started the fire. Lance told them where you are. Nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car pulling up outside. \nESTELLE (V.O.) Nick, they're coming to arrest you! He slams down the phone. \nEXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY \nThe window slides open and Nick comes crawling out, leaping to the ground. He takes off running through the woods. \nEXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY \nNick pounds on the door. \nLEFTY (O.S.) Nick? Nick turns to find Lefty coming up the path with two bags of groceries under his arms. \nNICK Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today? \nLEFTY Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's been arrested. \nNICK Arrested?!? \nLEFTY For grand theft auto. They found his prints in your father's car. \nNICK That's terrible. Did he go quietly? \nLEFTY No. He said you were his accomplice and now the Ukiah police are looking for you! We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression. Then - \nEXT. WOODS - DUSK \nWe're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up with Nick as he flees. \nNICK (V.O.) The day has proven to be a disaster. Where did I gone wrong? I have a decision to make. \nEXT. COVERED BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the bridge and continues down the road. \nNICK (V.O.) I could hit the road and spend my life a fugitive with my integrity nearly intact. \nUNDER THE BRIDGE Nick squats in the shadows. He's holding a bouquet of municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his tie. \nNICK (V.O.) It's that or risk incarceration to keep my dinner date. \n(BEAT) Obviously the answer is clear. \nThey begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search light briefly coming through the windows. Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war paint. \nMRS. SAUNDERS Paul? Your father looks rather strange. \nPAUL Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement. \nMRS. SAUNDERS That's no excuse. Another helicopter passes overhead. \nTAGGARTY The food is delicious, Paul. \nPAUL Thank you. \n(BEAT) Sister, darling, how long has it been since we all observed the rituals of Thanksgiving? \nSHEENI Not long enough, Paul. \nNICK I hope it's the first of many such occasions for me. Sheeni narrows her eyes at him. A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then- Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song. \nMRS. SAUNDERS Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/ Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright... Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others accompany her as Mr. Saunders pretends to conduct them with a drumstick. \nEVERYONE Round yon virgin Mother and Child/ Holy infant so tender and mild/ Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep in heavenly pee-eace. \nAnd with that, the doorbell rings. Taggarty gets up and opens the door. \nTAGGARTY Oh, Trent, you made it. Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy of Ed Solomon, still remains. \nTRENT Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone. Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap. \nSHEENI Trent, darling, this is Nick. Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes. \nTRENT Nick, at last we meet. \nNICK Hello, Trent. \nTAGGARTY Have a seat, Trent. \nTRENT I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay. I have bad news. \nSHEENI What is it? \nTRENT Bernice Lynch has tried to commit suicide. Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard. \nTRENT She swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and is now in a coma. \nSHEENI The poor girl. \nTRENT There's more. Before I left school, I searched her room. \nNICK Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials? \nTRENT No, Nick, I acted on my own initiative. In Bernice's closet, I found this letter. He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket. \nTRENT In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied. \nTAGGARTY Nick, you didn't! \nNICK Well, you see... \nSHEENI Nick! You could have killed me! \nMR. SAUNDERS Who died? \nTRENT No one yet, Mr. Saunders. Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction. \nMRS. SAUNDERS \nARREST HIM! \nTRENT I can't arrest him. But I have called the Santa Cruz Police. They are on their way here now. Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands. \nNICK Well, I shall be going now. Please continue without me. \nTRENT Nick, I suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man. Nick stops in front of Trent. \nNICK Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent. And please, do drop dead. The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the doorway. \nNICK (V.O.) ...my father, no longer burdened with crippling child support payments, would now be able to afford the model BMW he always wanted... \nI/E. BMW M6SMG - MOVING - FLASHFORWARD - DAY Dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as his flab flaps in the wind. \nNICK (V.O.) ...and would come to find the surrogate son he always wanted in Dwayne, the only organism alive that could possibly appreciate George's driving. As the car accelerates, we see the vanity plate reads THUNDER \nROD. \nNICK (V.O.) Leaving just one last piece of business. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nAnd finally we arrive on Sheeni, expressionless. And as we continue to PAN we reach... Carlotta standing in the background. The bombshell haircut and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil. Paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of silence to observe the open casket and the SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt and shorts that are being buried inside. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DUSK \nSheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses. She approaches the distant Carlotta. \nSHEENI Excuse me. Are you a friend of Nick's? Carlotta looks up, startled. She composes herself and shakes Sheeni's hand. \nNICK/CARLOTTA A terribly old friend. Carlotta Ulanksy. I'm sorry for your loss. \nSHEENI You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no doubt culpable for Nick's actions. \nNICK/CARLOTTA Well, love does compel us to desperate acts. People cannot always act rationally. \n(MORE) \nNICK/CARLOTTA (cont'd) The greater the love, the stronger the passions, the more reckless the crimes. Sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile. \nSHEENI Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit. \nNICK/CARLOTTA My dear, if there's one thing the demise of Nick Twisp has taught me, it's that self worth comes from within. Sheeni gives a pensive nod. \nSHEENI Would you like to stay the night, Carlotta? We can reminisce of our departed. \nNICK/CARLOTTA Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really must... \nSHEENI It's just... I don't think I could bear to be alone tonight. Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows. \nINT. SHEENI'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCarlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while Sheeni brushes in the bathroom. Carlotta hastily switches out the light. Sheeni emerges in a few small scraps of flimsy black lace. \nNICK/CARLOTTA Goodness. What an attractive negligee. \nSHEENI Do you like it? I bought it in Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped to wear it for Nick. \nNICK/CARLOTTA Oh, darling, I'm sure he would have found it most... Appealing. Sheeni crawls into bed. She cuddles close. \nSHEENI I like lying here with you, Carlotta. \nNICK/CARLOTTA You do? \nSHEENI I can't think of anyone I'd rather lie here with. Carlotta furrows her brow. \nSHEENI Except maybe Nick. If Nick were here, what do you suppose he would do to me? \nNICK/CARLOTTA Make love to you I would think. \nSHEENI Then why don't you? \nNICK/CARLOTTA Pardon? \nSHEENI Take off that silly wig and make love to me! Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room. \nNICK Sheeni! You knew! \nSHEENI Of course, Nick. Did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise? Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness. \nSHEENI Take me darling! And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge. The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah. The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED \nBACKGROUND. \nLAS VEGAS OF THE BODY Into the NICK'S PENIS nightclub where champagne bottles POP with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards ROAR, and the stage erupts with fireworks. \n", "test1_input": "YOUTH IN REVOLT \nWritten by \nGustin Nash \nJuly 13, 2007 \nOVER BLACK comes the sound of deep HEAVING BREATHS. Moist FLESH FLAPPING accompaniment. Someone is beating off. A pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine. The beating off resumes at a quickened pace. The SQUEAKING of bed springs joins in. Another page is turned. Feverish THUMPING until a MALE VOICE lets out a quiet MOAN. The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a relieved sigh of finality. \nNICK (V.O.) My name... is Nick. \nNICK TWISP, 16, stares up at the ceiling. He's glassy eyed from the exertion... \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \n...sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well thumbed issue of Penthouse covers his privates. \nNICK (V.O.) My last name, which I loath, is Twisp. \nNick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed. He pulls the drawer under his mattress out. \nNICK (V.O.) The next thing you should know about me is that I am obsessed with sex. \nA view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler. He puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place. \nNICK (V.O.) Lately, I have become morbidly aware of my penis. \nNick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles again. He looks at himself from various angles. \nNICK (V.O.) Once a remote region accessed indifferently for micturition, it has developed overnight into a gaudy Las Vegas of the body. \nWe PAN DOWN, and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there is a hole in the screen leading us to... \nLAS VEGAS OF THE BODY The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: NICK'S PENIS. We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show. Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD leaps through a burning HOOP on stage. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nNick typing on an obsolete PC. \nNICK (V.O.) I am entering the tenth grade at St. Vitus Academy, which, I am told, is the most rigorous prep school in the East Bay. Hopefully I will be invited to join Miss Satron's English Literature class. \nA view of the books and CDs on his shelf. \nNICK (V.O.) I am a voracious reader and listen to Frank Sinatra. So needless to say, I am still a virgin. \nFollow the curser on the monitor as he types the words - \nSTILL A VIRGIN. He pauses in thought, then continues. \nNICK (V.O.) I have yet to hold hands with a girl, let alone have my winkie up her wendell. \nINT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - DAY \nWE MOVE down an airplane aisle, past PASSENGERS sleeping and chatting. \nNICK (V.O.) I am an only child except for my big sister Joanie, who has left the bosom of her family to sling hash at 35,000 feet. \nWe reach the end of the aisle, where a buxom twenty- something, JOANIE TWISP serves a beverage. \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nLiver frying in a pan. ESTELLE TWISP, 43, cooks and puffs on a cigarette at the same time. \nNICK (V.O.) Mom gives driver's tests at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper. He watches with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate. \nNICK (V.O.) She used to keep Dad up to date on all the motor statutes he was violating. This is one of the reasons they got divorced. JERRY, early 40's, saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers. His gut hangs over the elastic, but he is completely devoid of an ass. \nNICK (V.O.) Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long distance trucker, though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability. Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt. Waddles over to the breakfast table. He snatches the Funnies from the paper in Nick's hands. \nNICK (V.O.) I've been struggling to think of a commendable thing to say about Jerry. Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon. Nick glares. \nNICK (V.O.) No luck. His grey matter registers at cretin and the needle doesn't budge. \nEXT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - DAY \n", "test1_true": "NICK (V.O.) Dad is a copywriter for agricultural magazines. In the drive, Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims of his dad's BMW 325i. \nNICK (V.O.) He'd like to own a more prestigious model of BMW, but, as he often reminds me, he is burdened with crippling child support payments. \nNick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings than the coastline of Albania. She continues past him and embraces George. \nNICK (V.O.) Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She is twenty and a recently minted alumna of Stanfort. Super:          (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology) George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. Nick turns his attention back to the Beamer. As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on the hose slackens. Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \nWe're back with Nick as he types on his computer. He looks down at the tent in his boxers. \nCUT TO: He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection. \nNICK'S POV of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room. \nNICK (V.O.) My mother is the one who painted my room to look like Dolly Parton's boudoir. She read this color was used in hospitals to calm mental patients. Nick closes his eyes, his right arm moving rhythmically. \nNICK (V.O.) I'll tell you what I told her. I am not mentally ill. BLACKNESS. The masturbation reaches its feverous climax. Then the long moan and sigh of relief. \nNICK (V.O.) I'm just a teenager. And as Frank Sinatra's UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG begins, we go to OPENING CREDITS. \nYOUTH IN REVOLT \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nNick regards Jerry from across the dining room table. There is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios. Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. Estelle is washing dishes when she spies something out the window. \nESTELLE Jerry? Where did that car come from? Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive. \nJERRY It's a '62 Lincoln convertible. Like the one Kennedy was shot in. \nNICK Except his was black and yours is white. And dirty. \nJERRY See that. I was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast. But now I guess it'll just be her and me. You have your smart mouth to thank for that. \nNICK Damn it. I guess I'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository. \nJERRY The what? \nESTELLE Jerry, I don't understand. What happened to the Chevy-Nova? \nJERRY Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle. That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile! Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner savvy. \nEXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nNick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for Jerry to open the passenger door for her. \nNICK (V.O.) After spending twelve years with Dad, Mom has had a string of lovers, none of whom she has asked me to approve. Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs in and chugs his beer. Estelle appears mildly disappointed before opening the door herself. \nNICK (V.O.) I'm starting to think her boyfriends are like U.S. Presidents. As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the direction of the trash can at the end of the drive. \nNICK (V.O.) Just when you think they can't get any worse... He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry drives off anyway. \nNICK (V.O.) ...she manages to find God's Perfect Asshole. \nINT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nON A TV SCREEN Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX DOCUMENTARY he recorded. \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nFrom the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle. Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell. The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time, the orgy gets muted. Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers. \nI/E. ESTELLE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS standing on the stoop. \nTheir eyes drift to Nick's mid-section. Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste. He returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt. \nSAILOR #1 Is Jerry here? \nNICK He just left. What's up? \nSAILOR #1 What's up is that hunk of shit Chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up. \nSAILOR #2 And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission. The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job. A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can. Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop. \n", "test1_id": 1356, "test2_input": "GEORGE Look who's wearing the pants this morning. Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs. \nLACEY Nick, I feel for you. It must be tough being a teenager in this house. \nNICK My mother wasn't any better. \nLACEY Your mom has had a difficult time. She has had a great deal to put up with. I'm starting to appreciate that now. \nGEORGE Are you by any chance referring to me? \nLACEY If the shoe fits, suck on it. George swills some zin and mumbles ominously. \nGEORGE We'll see who's sucking on what soon. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nVIJAY I spoke with Taggarty this morning. She requested a wallet sized photo. Nick looks up glumly from his lunch. Lefty has his feet up on the table, his facial growth is almost respectable. \nLEFTY Congratulations, Vijay. That makes it official. Welcome to the club. Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins. \nNICK What grade did you receive? \nVIJAY A C+. Which I feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions. \nLEFTY I guess this means they're not being expelled. \nVIJAY No, apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent. \nNICK Are you kidding? She had her flashlight trained on your Hindi boner! A beat. Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst. \nVIJAY No need to be jealous, Nick. Nick stands and collects his lunch tray. \nNICK (V.O.) If I'm to get Sheeni expelled and sent back to me I will need a partner in crime. \nINT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY \nNick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine. \nNICK (V.O.) Luckily, Fran\u00e7ois has a girl on the inside. Nick begins typing and speaking out loud. \nNICK Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom. \nINT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY \nBernice reads the letter. \nNICK (V.O.) I just want you to know I now see why you loath Sheeni Saunders so strongly. \nINT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nSheeni, Taggarty, and Heather sit across from the HEADMASTER as the matron describes the events. \nNICK (V.O.) I too have come to despise the snooty, pretentious brunette and in all honesty you should probably get her expelled. I am happy to help in that regard. \nINT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY \nNICK (V.O.) I have included a number of sleeping pills with this note. Bernice dumps the pills from the envelope. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nNICK (V.O.) You must introduce one of these into her breakfast beverage each day. Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being ignored. Bernice drops a pill into Sheeni's coffee nonchalantly. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nSheeni watches the INSTRUCTOR. \nNICK (V.O.) She may be intelligent, but she is not likely to pass her courses when she's falling asleep in class. Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off. We MOVE across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her notebook. \nNICK (V.O.) Since meeting you, I have come to realize my interest in Sheeni was only a transient adolescent infatuation. I like you more than I can say. Take courage. Together we will outsmart these cake eaters. A view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name with hearts. She flips through pages of obsession. \nINT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY \nNick's fingers fly across the keys. He looks pleased with himself. \nNICK (V.O.) Affectionately yours, Nick. \n", "test2_true": "NICK (V.O.) P.S. Please destroy this note immediately. \nON A MAILBOX As Nick deposits his letter. \nEXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - EVENING \nNick wanders up the drive. WE FOLLOW him into the house. \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - CONTINUOUS \n...where he comes upon the sight of Paul giving Lacey a foot message on the couch. \nNICK Where's Dad? \nLACEY \n(DREAMILY) Daddy is in Davenport. Where you left his car. \nPAUL We saved you some mushrooms, Nick. Nick watches the sensual foot message. He picks up the bag full of mushrooms and considers them. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNick pukes his guts into the sink. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNick's in bed reading Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets. He glances up at Dwayne playing Nintendo and scowls. There comes the strange warbled sound of a TRUMPET from the next room, and it is joined by other instruments until we hear The Nutley Brass' rendition of I WANT TO BE SEDATED. Nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion. \nON THE BOOK as the nude figures suddenly BECOME ANIMATED, making wonderful love. Nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page. \nWE FOLLOW Nick as he follows the nude figures who do acrobatics down... \nTHE HALL and into... \nTHE LIVING ROOM where Lacey watches Paul blow on his trumpet. Nick marvels. The phone rings. \nLACEY Nick? Get the phone? Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's feet. \nNICK (into phone) Hello? \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT George cradles the cell phone. WE INTERCUT. \nGEORGE Nick? Is that you? \nNICK I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a breathing organism. \nGEORGE Quit fooling around, Nick. This is your dad. Is everything okay there? \nNICK Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything will be okay. You deserve to be loved. \nGEORGE What the hell is that supposed to mean? Is Lacey there? \nNICK Lacey is here. Paul is caressing her toes. \nGEORGE Paul! Who the hell is Paul? \nNICK Paul is our friend. He makes beautiful music for the acrobats. They're naked. \nGEORGE Who's naked? Is Lacey naked? \nNICK Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye. He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord. He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet. \nNICK Dad is afraid. \nLACEY He is on the wrong path. I have felt that for some time. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNick watches the headlights from the arriving BMW travel across the walls. They go out. He listens to the front door being keyed followed by his father bellowing. Nick gets up and wanders into... \nLIVING ROOM where Paul stands between George and Lacey. \nPAUL Okay, George, just calm down. George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to the floor. \nGEORGE You are in serious trouble. You've assaulted me and I know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son. That child is only twelve years old. George gets to his feet. \n", "test2_id": 1357, "test3_input": "NICK Let me make it easy. I'll be at Redwood High School tomorrow morning. Round up your donut dipping friends. I'm turning myself in. Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond. \nI/E. BUS (MOVING) - DAY Nick sits by the window, the suitcase on the seat next to him. \nEXT. UKIAH - DAY \nAnd the bus flies past the sign that says WELCOME TO UKIAH. \nEXT. UKIAH BUS STOP - NIGHT \nNick steps off the bus and finds Lefty loading his belongings underneath. \nNICK Lefty? Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend. \nLEFTY Nick? What are you doing here? Everyone and their mother's mother is looking for you. \nNICK They have me soon enough. Where are you going? \nLEFTY Home. I'm done being dead, Nick. Heather and I are going back to Oakland for Christmas. You should have heard how glad my parents were that I didn't kill myself. They were even happier when they found out I'm not gay. \nNICK That's great, Lefty. \nLEFTY Yeah, being in love is pretty great. So what's your plan, Nick? \nNick answers with only pensive silence. \nEXT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - NIGHT \nNick is about to knock on the door when Paul opens it in another display of clairvoyance. \nPAUL Welcome back, Nick. We had a feeling you were coming. \nINT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER \nNick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch the infamous \"chicken scene\" in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. \nNICK (V.O.) Paul and Lacey are kind enough to share some leftover fungi to help calm my nerves. That, combined with yet another viewing of James Dean's performance is what gives me my final burst of inspiration. They all watch transfixed as JAMES DEAN leaps from his automobile just in time to escape demise. \nINT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER \nAs the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them, Lacey fits a bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of make-up that make him... ...who we will come to know as CARLOTTA ULANSKY. Nick regards his female alter-ego in the mirror. \nNICK (V.O.) Fran\u00e7ois of course wants no part of this, and demands that we make a run for the border. But I have decided to veto him. It's time to face the music. \nINT. BMW 325I - DAY \nNick turns the key in the ignition and CHRISTMAS MUSIC rises from the speakers. And the music plays over... \nEXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \n...where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of Nick's arrival. Nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LATER \n...where police cars and news crews are pulling up to interview the students. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LATER \nThe parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and FBI vans, the news crews, REDWOOD HIGH STUDENTS, and an apparently CALIFORNIA WIDE NICK TWISP CULT FOLLOWING. TINA MANION, 17, speaks into a STUDENT NEWS CREW CAMERA. \nTINA This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the FBI awaits the promised arrival of Nick Twisp. There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the student camera-man to the road on the ridge where... George's BMW pulls to a stop overlooking the school. \nGEORGE Hey. That's my car! The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges. \nNICK'S POV of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel. \nON THE VARIOUS FACES OF THE CROWD staring up in silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne, George, Lacey, Paul... Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity. The parking lot erupts with CHEERS of his name. A few Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads I'M SINGLE, LET'S \nMINGLE. Then - shouts of warning from the megaphones. And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back into his father's car and peels out. \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY Nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through the cloud kicked up in his wake. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - DAY \nHe zips across the covered bridge, the train of law enforcement in hot pursuit. \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY He yanks the wheel hard and veers off onto the mountain road. A few of the squad cars miss the turn and skid side-long through a picket fence. Nick takes the switchbacks at 60 per, wheels practically sliding off the turns. \nEXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY \nThe BMW crests the hill and smashes through the chain link gate. \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY As Nick watches the quickly approaching cliffs edge, he undoes his seat belt. He goes for the door handle, eyes going wide when he finds power lock has engaged. \nEXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY \nThe BMW hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air, tires spinning, a plume of snow blowing off the hood. The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside- down, hitting the ice covered surface of Clear Lake with a thundering SMACK. Police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole in the ice. \nUNDERWATER The BMW descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles. As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a somber TRUMPET SOLO comes in pre-lap and we are... \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nWhere a crowd of family, friends, and fans stand around in mourning garb over the funeral ceremony. \nNICK (V.O.) My only comfort regarding my untimely death is knowing my friends and family will do just fine without me. We move from Lacey and Paul, the latter of which is wailing away on the trumpet, to Lefty, his head hung low. Heather pulls his head to her breasts. \nNICK (V.O.) As it would turn out Heather's vaginal canal is slightly misshapen... \nINT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - FLASHFORWARD - DAY \nLefty humping Heather in the grass ala the scene in which we met him. \nNICK (V.O.) ...and thus completely compatible with Lefty's otherwise incongruent penis. \nHEATHER A little to the right... a little... RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE! \nRIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERE! \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \n...where we find Vijay glancing over at Taggarty as she smokes a cigarette. \nNICK (V.O.) Vijay would eventually manage to pin the car theft on me. But had lost the attention of Taggarty forever. Who by the way... \nINT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - FLASHFORWARD - NIGHT \nNICK (V.O.) ...never would find her perfect A. Taggarty at her wall. Ed Solomon lounges in the bed behind her. \nNICK (V.O.) And would therefore start grading on a curve. With a quick stroke of her pen, she changes Ed's grade from a B minus to a B plus. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \n...where we find Joanie sniffling. \nNICK (V.O.) Joanie of course would get to continue to travel the world... \nINT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - FLASHFORWARD - DAY \nJoanie serves up a beverage in first class. \nNICK   (V.O.) ...and she and   her breasts would probably go on   to have the wonderful life   that they deserve. The CELEBRITY she is serving looks from her cleavage to her eyes. She gives a little smile. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \n...where we find Estelle weeping quietly against Wally's shoulder. \nNICK (V.O.) Wally as it turns out... \nINT. JEOPARDY STUDIO - FLASHFORWARD - NIGHT \nEstelle watches from the audience as Wally scribbles at his podium while ALEX TREBECK hosts inaudibly. \nNICK (V.O.) ...would go on Jeopardy and win, ensuring my mother's blessed rise to a higher economic status. The answer on Wally's screen says WHO IS ALBERT CAMUS? Alex Trebeck shakes his head, leaving Wally with only $1, but enough to best his two competitors. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \n...where we find George puffing on a cigar, Mrs. Crampton behind him, his hand resting on Dwayne's shoulder. \n", "test3_id": 1358}

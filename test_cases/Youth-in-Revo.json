{"test1_input": "YOUTH IN REVOLT \nWritten by \nGustin Nash \nJuly 13, 2007 \nOVER BLACK comes the sound of deep HEAVING BREATHS. Moist FLESH FLAPPING accompaniment. Someone is beating off. A pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine. The beating off resumes at a quickened pace. The SQUEAKING of bed springs joins in. Another page is turned. Feverish THUMPING until a MALE VOICE lets out a quiet MOAN. The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a relieved sigh of finality. \nNICK (V.O.) My name... is Nick. \nNICK TWISP, 16, stares up at the ceiling. He's glassy eyed from the exertion... \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \n...sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well thumbed issue of Penthouse covers his privates. \nNICK (V.O.) My last name, which I loath, is Twisp. \nNick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed. He pulls the drawer under his mattress out. \nNICK (V.O.) The next thing you should know about me is that I am obsessed with sex. \nA view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler. He puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place. \nNICK (V.O.) Lately, I have become morbidly aware of my penis. \nNick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles again. He looks at himself from various angles. \nNICK (V.O.) Once a remote region accessed indifferently for micturition, it has developed overnight into a gaudy Las Vegas of the body. \nWe PAN DOWN, and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there is a hole in the screen leading us to... \nLAS VEGAS OF THE BODY The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: NICK'S PENIS. We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show. Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD leaps through a burning HOOP on stage. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nNick typing on an obsolete PC. \nNICK (V.O.) I am entering the tenth grade at St. Vitus Academy, which, I am told, is the most rigorous prep school in the East Bay. Hopefully I will be invited to join Miss Satron's English Literature class. \nA view of the books and CDs on his shelf. \nNICK (V.O.) I am a voracious reader and listen to Frank Sinatra. So needless to say, I am still a virgin. \nFollow the curser on the monitor as he types the words - \nSTILL A VIRGIN. He pauses in thought, then continues. \nNICK (V.O.) I have yet to hold hands with a girl, let alone have my winkie up her wendell. \nINT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - DAY \nWE MOVE down an airplane aisle, past PASSENGERS sleeping and chatting. \nNICK (V.O.) I am an only child except for my big sister Joanie, who has left the bosom of her family to sling hash at 35,000 feet. \nWe reach the end of the aisle, where a buxom twenty- something, JOANIE TWISP serves a beverage. \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nLiver frying in a pan. ESTELLE TWISP, 43, cooks and puffs on a cigarette at the same time. \nNICK (V.O.) Mom gives driver's tests at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper. He watches with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate. \nNICK (V.O.) She used to keep Dad up to date on all the motor statutes he was violating. This is one of the reasons they got divorced. JERRY, early 40's, saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers. His gut hangs over the elastic, but he is completely devoid of an ass. \nNICK (V.O.) Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long distance trucker, though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability. Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt. Waddles over to the breakfast table. He snatches the Funnies from the paper in Nick's hands. \nNICK (V.O.) I've been struggling to think of a commendable thing to say about Jerry. Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon. Nick glares. \nNICK (V.O.) No luck. His grey matter registers at cretin and the needle doesn't budge. \nEXT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - DAY \n", "test1_true": "NICK (V.O.) Dad is a copywriter for agricultural magazines. In the drive, Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims of his dad's BMW 325i. \nNICK (V.O.) He'd like to own a more prestigious model of BMW, but, as he often reminds me, he is burdened with crippling child support payments. \nNick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings than the coastline of Albania. She continues past him and embraces George. \nNICK (V.O.) Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She is twenty and a recently minted alumna of Stanfort. Super:          (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology) George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. Nick turns his attention back to the Beamer. As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on the hose slackens. Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \nWe're back with Nick as he types on his computer. He looks down at the tent in his boxers. \nCUT TO: He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection. \nNICK'S POV of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room. \nNICK (V.O.) My mother is the one who painted my room to look like Dolly Parton's boudoir. She read this color was used in hospitals to calm mental patients. Nick closes his eyes, his right arm moving rhythmically. \nNICK (V.O.) I'll tell you what I told her. I am not mentally ill. BLACKNESS. The masturbation reaches its feverous climax. Then the long moan and sigh of relief. \nNICK (V.O.) I'm just a teenager. And as Frank Sinatra's UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG begins, we go to OPENING CREDITS. \nYOUTH IN REVOLT \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nNick regards Jerry from across the dining room table. There is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios. Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. Estelle is washing dishes when she spies something out the window. \nESTELLE Jerry? Where did that car come from? Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive. \nJERRY It's a '62 Lincoln convertible. Like the one Kennedy was shot in. \nNICK Except his was black and yours is white. And dirty. \nJERRY See that. I was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast. But now I guess it'll just be her and me. You have your smart mouth to thank for that. \nNICK Damn it. I guess I'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository. \nJERRY The what? \nESTELLE Jerry, I don't understand. What happened to the Chevy-Nova? \nJERRY Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle. That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile! Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner savvy. \nEXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nNick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for Jerry to open the passenger door for her. \nNICK (V.O.) After spending twelve years with Dad, Mom has had a string of lovers, none of whom she has asked me to approve. Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs in and chugs his beer. Estelle appears mildly disappointed before opening the door herself. \nNICK (V.O.) I'm starting to think her boyfriends are like U.S. Presidents. As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the direction of the trash can at the end of the drive. \nNICK (V.O.) Just when you think they can't get any worse... He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry drives off anyway. \nNICK (V.O.) ...she manages to find God's Perfect Asshole. \nINT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY \nON A TV SCREEN Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX DOCUMENTARY he recorded. \nINT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nFrom the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle. Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell. The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time, the orgy gets muted. Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers. \nI/E. ESTELLE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS standing on the stoop. \nTheir eyes drift to Nick's mid-section. Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste. He returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt. \nSAILOR #1 Is Jerry here? \nNICK He just left. What's up? \nSAILOR #1 What's up is that hunk of shit Chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up. \nSAILOR #2 And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission. The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job. A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can. Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop. \n", "test1_id": 1356, "test2_input": "Joanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs. Estelle stands over them. \nESTELLE What the in God's name has gotten into you?!? Jerry paid good money for that trailer! \nNICK And just what makes you so sure it was me? \nESTELLE Who the hell else would write such a thing? Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE. \nESTELLE And just how do you explain this? She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey. \nNICK That's Lacey. \nESTELLE And just who the hell is Lacey? \nNICK Dad's girlfriend. Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and envy. \nESTELLE His girlfriend? What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend? \nJOANIE C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures like that to... \nESTELLE When I want your opinion on raising my child, I'll ask for it. (to Nick; morbidly \nCURIOUS) And what's this Lacey tart like? \nNICK Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad. Super:             (True) \nNICK She likes to sit on Dad's lap while he eats and blow in his ear. Super:           (Not true) \nNICK And she calls him \"Thunder Rod\" and he calls her \"Sugar Puss.\" Super:       (True; believe it or not) At this point Estelle has turned bright red. \nESTELLE You are confined to your room until school starts, you sick pervert. She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement. \nNICK I wish I was leaving with you tonight. \nJOANIE Your day will come. I never thought mine would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up? \nNICK I wish. Did you really take a posture class? \nJOANIE Implants. I wanted them all my life. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY \nA knock on the door. Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the headphones off his ears. \nNICK Hey, Lefty. \nLEFTY What's with your mom, Nick? She gave me the third degree just to come up here. \nNICK I vandalized Jerry's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey. \nLEFTY Well, good thing I stole this from the bookstore then. Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets. \nLEFTY I was reading it all last night. Boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than I thought. Did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole? \nNICK You lie. \nLEFTY No way, man. Here, I got the page marked. Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them flip through the manual. \nNICK Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try this on Sheeni. I think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other. They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay. \nLEFTY Are we really supposed to be that... uh... big? \nNICK I think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis. \nLEFTY Maybe we should compare. \nNICK Perhaps we should. Just for the sake of research. Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet. They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets a hint of concern in his expression. Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for the curvature. The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her, pants around their ankles. \nESTELLE \nPERVERTS! She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way. \nESTELLE \nFRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS! \n", "test2_true": "Lefty emerges from the room and takes off. \nESTELLE You won't get away! I'm calling your parents! PERVERTS! Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his pants. Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound sex manual as they round the bannister. \nESTELLE In my house! How dare you! She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks him upside the head. \nHe loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase, letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step. He comes crashing into the foyer, landing on the slate. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - EVENING \nNick watches out the window. Estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to LEFTY'S PARENTS. Lefty glances up at Nick and gives a pained expression. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - LATER \nNick lays on his belly reading No Exit. He looks up when he hears the sound of footsteps in the hall. Shadows appear beneath the crack in the door. Estelle opens the door and looks down at him. \nESTELLE Nick, I just want you to know that I've thought about it, and I've accepted that you are gay. \nNICK Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay. If you're really concerned though, I suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can straighten me out, it's Sheeni. She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone. \nESTELLE That sounds more like a job for your father. Here, he wants to talk to you. Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door. \nNICK (into phone) Hello? \nINT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - NIGHT \nGEORGE So what's this I hear about you being gay? George sprawls on the couch, cradling the phone with one hand, and holding a beer on his stomach with the other. WE \nINTERCUT. \nNICK What's this I hear about you being unemployed? \nGEORGE Yes, but my condition is only temporary. I can change it. \nNICK I hope you do. We need the money. \nGEORGE Nick, there are more important things in life than money. \nNICK I know, Dad. Like getting a good education. And being able to respect your parents. \nGEORGE I've got two words for you. Safe sex. \nNICK Thanks, Dad. He hangs up the phone. \nEXT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY \nIntimidating PUNK MUSIC. School bus doors fold open and Nick steps off. The MUSIC pounds from the boom box resting on the hood of the Mustang GT where a pack of SKINHEADS follow Nick with their eyes. Nick walks past them, glancing over at the assembly of ASIAN GANGSTERS glaring at him from their perch on the wall. \nINT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nNick pushes past a fight where two kids throw each other against the lockers. He smiles at a pair of PUNK ROCK GIRLS. One of them flips him off. Nick heads into... \nINT. BOYS ROOM - DAY \nAnd as Nick steps into the bathroom, we follow his eyes... SWISH TO... a CRIP selling a bag of dope to a GOTH FRESHMAN. SWISH TO... a LATIN KING vandalizing the wall with the words \nLATIN KINGS WERE HERE. SWISH TO... a pack of WIGGERS as one of them gives the others a butterfly knife show-and-tell. \nINT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nWE DRIFT down the corridor where Nick dials at a pay phone. \nFEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.) Office of Child Welfare. \nNICK Hello, uh... My name is Nick. Nick Twisp. My father's name is George Twisp. \nFEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.) Has he hit you, Nick? \nNICK Not lately. But he's missed several child support payments, and is not looking for work. So now I'm going to public school in Oakland. \nFEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.) Not the Oakland schools! \nNICK Yes. And he's had an offer from a respectable publication in Ukiah. \nFEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.) Don't you worry, young man. I'll get right on this. Don't worry. We'll light a fire under that deadbeat! \n", "test2_id": 1357, "test3_input": "GEORGE Look who's wearing the pants this morning. Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs. \nLACEY Nick, I feel for you. It must be tough being a teenager in this house. \nNICK My mother wasn't any better. \nLACEY Your mom has had a difficult time. She has had a great deal to put up with. I'm starting to appreciate that now. \nGEORGE Are you by any chance referring to me? \nLACEY If the shoe fits, suck on it. George swills some zin and mumbles ominously. \nGEORGE We'll see who's sucking on what soon. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nVIJAY I spoke with Taggarty this morning. She requested a wallet sized photo. Nick looks up glumly from his lunch. Lefty has his feet up on the table, his facial growth is almost respectable. \nLEFTY Congratulations, Vijay. That makes it official. Welcome to the club. Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins. \nNICK What grade did you receive? \nVIJAY A C+. Which I feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions. \nLEFTY I guess this means they're not being expelled. \nVIJAY No, apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent. \nNICK Are you kidding? She had her flashlight trained on your Hindi boner! A beat. Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst. \nVIJAY No need to be jealous, Nick. Nick stands and collects his lunch tray. \nNICK (V.O.) If I'm to get Sheeni expelled and sent back to me I will need a partner in crime. \nINT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY \nNick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine. \nNICK (V.O.) Luckily, Fran\u00e7ois has a girl on the inside. Nick begins typing and speaking out loud. \nNICK Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom. \nINT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY \nBernice reads the letter. \nNICK (V.O.) I just want you to know I now see why you loath Sheeni Saunders so strongly. \nINT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - DAY \nSheeni, Taggarty, and Heather sit across from the HEADMASTER as the matron describes the events. \nNICK (V.O.) I too have come to despise the snooty, pretentious brunette and in all honesty you should probably get her expelled. I am happy to help in that regard. \nINT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY \nNICK (V.O.) I have included a number of sleeping pills with this note. Bernice dumps the pills from the envelope. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nNICK (V.O.) You must introduce one of these into her breakfast beverage each day. Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being ignored. Bernice drops a pill into Sheeni's coffee nonchalantly. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nSheeni watches the INSTRUCTOR. \nNICK (V.O.) She may be intelligent, but she is not likely to pass her courses when she's falling asleep in class. Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off. We MOVE across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her notebook. \nNICK (V.O.) Since meeting you, I have come to realize my interest in Sheeni was only a transient adolescent infatuation. I like you more than I can say. Take courage. Together we will outsmart these cake eaters. A view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name with hearts. She flips through pages of obsession. \nINT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY \nNick's fingers fly across the keys. He looks pleased with himself. \nNICK (V.O.) Affectionately yours, Nick. \n", "test3_true": "NICK (V.O.) P.S. Please destroy this note immediately. \nON A MAILBOX As Nick deposits his letter. \nEXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - EVENING \nNick wanders up the drive. WE FOLLOW him into the house. \nINT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - CONTINUOUS \n...where he comes upon the sight of Paul giving Lacey a foot message on the couch. \nNICK Where's Dad? \nLACEY \n(DREAMILY) Daddy is in Davenport. Where you left his car. \nPAUL We saved you some mushrooms, Nick. Nick watches the sensual foot message. He picks up the bag full of mushrooms and considers them. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nNick pukes his guts into the sink. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNick's in bed reading Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets. He glances up at Dwayne playing Nintendo and scowls. There comes the strange warbled sound of a TRUMPET from the next room, and it is joined by other instruments until we hear The Nutley Brass' rendition of I WANT TO BE SEDATED. Nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion. \nON THE BOOK as the nude figures suddenly BECOME ANIMATED, making wonderful love. Nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page. \nWE FOLLOW Nick as he follows the nude figures who do acrobatics down... \nTHE HALL and into... \nTHE LIVING ROOM where Lacey watches Paul blow on his trumpet. Nick marvels. The phone rings. \nLACEY Nick? Get the phone? Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's feet. \nNICK (into phone) Hello? \nI/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT George cradles the cell phone. WE INTERCUT. \nGEORGE Nick? Is that you? \nNICK I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a breathing organism. \nGEORGE Quit fooling around, Nick. This is your dad. Is everything okay there? \nNICK Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything will be okay. You deserve to be loved. \nGEORGE What the hell is that supposed to mean? Is Lacey there? \nNICK Lacey is here. Paul is caressing her toes. \nGEORGE Paul! Who the hell is Paul? \nNICK Paul is our friend. He makes beautiful music for the acrobats. They're naked. \nGEORGE Who's naked? Is Lacey naked? \nNICK Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye. He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord. He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet. \nNICK Dad is afraid. \nLACEY He is on the wrong path. I have felt that for some time. \nINT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nNick watches the headlights from the arriving BMW travel across the walls. They go out. He listens to the front door being keyed followed by his father bellowing. Nick gets up and wanders into... \nLIVING ROOM where Paul stands between George and Lacey. \nPAUL Okay, George, just calm down. George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to the floor. \nGEORGE You are in serious trouble. You've assaulted me and I know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son. That child is only twelve years old. George gets to his feet. \n", "test3_id": 1358}

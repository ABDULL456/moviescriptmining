The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose hurries after him. 
The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung. 
HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail. 
INT. JADE PALACE - HALLWAY 
The palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds of villagers behind him. 
CROWD (chanting) Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! 
Po is ushered in and the doors close. He is alone. He runs back to the closed palace doors. 
PO Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh... 
Po finally realizes where he is. 
PO (CONT'D) Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors. No way! Would you look at this place! 
He rushes up to a display of armor. 
PO (CONT'D) (GASP) Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With authentic battle damage! 
He rushes up to a green sword, making sure not to touch it. 
PO (CONT'D) (GASP) The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW! 
He stares at a black sopt on the wall. 
PO (CONT'D) (GASP) The Invisible Trident of Destiny!? 
He admires a painting. 
PO (CONT'D) (GASP) I've only seen paintings of that painting... 
Po runs around the room, amazed by all the ancient kung fu artifacts. Something special catches Po's eye. 
PO (CONT'D) (loudly) Nooo! Ohhhh! 
He runs over to it. 
PO (CONT'D) The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors! Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army. (calling into vase) Hellooo? 
SHIFU Have you finished sight-seeing? 
Po GASPS. 
PO (to vase) Sorry. I should've come to see you first. 
SHIFU My patience is wearing thin. 
PO (to vase) Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere. 
SHIFU Would you turn around? 
PO Sure. 
Po turns and sees Shifu. 
PO (CONT'D) Hey, how's it going? 
Po turns back to the vase.

LEIGH ANNE It breaks my heart but they're still in the hunt. Fulmer offered SJ a sweet deal. 
ED ORGERON I hear the kid can really pepper the gumbo. 
LEIGH ANNE He's his daddy's boy. 
163 INT.. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (LATER) 163 
Orgeron sits with Michael and SJ. 
ED ORGERON You a Ole Miss tackle, son. I'm buildin' my line, buildin' my team aroun' you. Make your parents proud, come to Oxford, get that sheepskin and help us win the SEC. Michael nods, turns to SJ. Before SJ can raise his hand -- 
ED ORGERON (CONT'D) And for you, Si, here's what I can do. At Ole Miss we have The Grove by the stadium. And the team walks it before the game, surrounded by thousands of fans. It's a sacred ritual. And I'm in front. 
SI ("that's it?") Seen it a thousand times. 
ED ORGERON Ever seen it from the front of the line? Next year, you and me -- leading the team. 
SI Tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin. 
ED ORGERON I'll throw in a sideline pass. Si considers this, smiles and nods. 
164 INT. WINGATE - LIBRARY -- DAY 164 
A press conference is under way. Photographers push to get a shot of -- Michael, at a table, stares at three caps -- Tennessee, LSU and Ole Miss. He smiles and selects an Ole Miss hat. 
165 INT. PHIL FULMER'S OFFICE - DAY 165 
Fulmer watches the press conference on TV. He tosses a piece of chalk against the wall. 
(CONTINUED) 
165 CONTINUED: 165 
FULMER This stinks to high heaven. 
166 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 166 
Leigh Anne and Bob have a chat in the empty classroom. 
BOB I will not give a student a grade he, or she, doesn't deserve. 
LEIGH ANNE He needs a B. What's he gonna have to do to "deserve" that? 
BOB Right now Michael's doing C minus, D plus work. His best chance at improving is with the written essay at the end of the year. It counts for a third of his grade. 
LEIGH ANNE That's it. We're sunk. 
167 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 167 
Miss Sue works with Michael at the table. 
MISS SUE Why not write about "Great Expectations"? You're a lot like Pip. He was poor, an orphan and someone sort of found him. You should be able to relate to that. Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball. 
MISS SUE (CONT'D) Fine, let's go through the reading list. But you have to pick one, Michael. (reading from list) "Pygmalion"... "A Tale of Two Cities"... "The Charge of the Light Brigade"... 
SEAN (almost to himself) "Half a league, half a league, half a league onward." I love that one. 
(CONTINUED) 
The Blind Side - Yellow Draft --04/15/09 107 
167 CONTINUED: 167 
MISS SUE Fine, you do this and I'll watch basketball. Miss Sue walks over, takes the remote from Sean, who rises. 
SEAN "All in the valley of Death rode the six hundred". They call LSU's stadium Death Valley because of this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson is writing about Ole Miss-LSU. 
MICHAEL You're kidding? 
SEAN No. It's a great story. 
MISS SUE It's a poem. 
SEAN "Forward the Light Brigade!" That's like the offense. "Charge for the guns'he said." That's the end zone. "Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred." He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed. 
SEAN (CONT'D) "Forward the Light Brigade! Was there a man dÂ±smay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew someone had blundered." 
MICHAEL Someone made a mistake? 
SEAN' Yeah, their leader, their coach. 
MICHAEL Why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up? 
SEAN "Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die: Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred." 
(CONTINUED) 
167 CONTINUED: 167 It hits Michael. He takes a moment, looks right at Sean. 
MICHAEL They all gonna die, aren't they?

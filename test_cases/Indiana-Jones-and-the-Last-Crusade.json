{"train": "INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE \nScreenplay by \nJEFF BOAM \nStory by \nGEORGE LUCAS and MENNO MEYJES \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY \nA mountain peak dominates the landscape. \nTITLES BEGIN. \nRiders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a company of Army Cavalry Soldiers. \nCLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS \nreveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO. \nThe OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops. \nOFFICER Dis-mount! \nRIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The \"Commanding Officer\" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock. \nOne of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him. \nFIRST SCOUT Herman's horsesick! \nA BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT. \nSCOUTMASTER Chaps, don't anybody wander off. Some of the passageways in here can run for miles. \nTwo Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff. \nINT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nThe two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair. \nHERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity. \nCONTINUED: \nHERMAN I don't think this is such a good idea. \nLAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source. \nThe VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden. \nHERMAN What is it? \nThis is what they see: \nFOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called \"Kivas.\" \nThe men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders). \nAnd the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is INDLANA JONES. \nHowever, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else. \nWe'll call him FEDORA. \nTITLES END. \nThe TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see. \nNow we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES. \nFEDORA Alfred, did you get anything yet? MAN Nothing. Dig in. \nTwo of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his hands. \nROSCOE Hey, I've got something! \nWhoops from the other men. \nROSCOE I got something, Garth! \nCONTINUED: (2) \nROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock. \nROSCOE I got something... I got something right here. \nMore whoops from the other men. \nFEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it. \nROSCOE (more whoops; then) Oh, look at thatl (more whoops) We're richl We're rich! \nHALFBREED Shut up. Shut up. \nPANAMA HAT Come on. Get him! \nINDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it. \nSpeeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin pumping. \nINDY VEERS OFF in a new direction\u0097toward a RAILROAD TRACK. \nEXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY \nThe train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN. \nHe clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from the truck onto the train. \nHALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar. \nINDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still running after him, Indy enters the trap door of... \nINT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY \nand finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc. \nCONTINUED: \nThen, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap door\u0097followed by ROUGH RIDER. Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp. \nINDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes. \nThe combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING. \nEveryone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car. \nHe lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye- to-eye with an\u0097 \nENORMOUS ANACONDA \nThe head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. \nINDY Oh... \nINDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT. \nINDY Oh... Oh... \nHundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him. \nINDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself. \nINDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape. \nHALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans. ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him. \nROUGH RIDER Here, let me. \nEXT. THE TRAIN- DAY \nINDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and tosses it away. \nROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to... \nEXT. A FLATCAR - DAY \nINDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar. \nINT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY \nas a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE BLACK RHINOCEROS. \nEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY \nROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE. \nIN THE BOXCAR BELOW \n... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF. \nBACK TO THE ROOFTOP \nas the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. SMASH! The horn comes up again\u0097RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS. \nINDY Holy smokes! \nINDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach. \nEXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY \nThe WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car. \nEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY \nINDY gets to his feet\u0097looks ahead\u0097sees a WATER TANK alongside the track directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea... \nIn an instant, he calculates his approach\u0097times the distance\u0097and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT. \nCONTINUED: \nHe catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see FEDORA walking toward him. \nINDY Dad! \nHENRY Out! \nINDY It's important! \nHENRY Then wait\u0097count to twenty. \nINDY No, Dad. You listen to me\u0097 \nHENRY (now he shouts) Junior! \nNo question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says \"What am I going to do with this guy?\" And obeys\u0097 starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY. \nINDY One, two, three, four... \nNow we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand sketching; then, he holds up one finger. \nHENRY In Greek. \nINDY's reaction: \nINDY (louder, in Greek) One... two... three... four... \nAn ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat. HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET. \nINDY's reaction: Trouble! \nHENRY is just finishing the sketch. \nHENRY May he who illuminated this... illuminate me... \nINT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY \nThe study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet. \nINDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman continues to spit\u0097right into Indy's face. Indy flinches. \nHERMAN I brought the Sheriff. \nHERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house. \nINDY Just the man I want to see! Now, there were five or six of them. \nSHERIFF (interrupting) All right, son. \nINDY (overlapping) ... they came after... me... \nSHERIFF You still got it? \nINDY Well, yes, sir. It's right here! \nINDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually. \nSHERIFF I'm glad to see that... because the rightful owner of this Cross won't press charges, if you give it back. \nFEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED. He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a friendly manner. \nSHERIFF He's got witnesses, five or six of them. \nThe SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots \nThe SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from Fedora, then runs out the door. \nROSCOE Yahoo! \nCONTINUED: \nAs ROSCOE runs outside INDY sees\u0097through the screen door\u0097the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front. Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Cross\u0097the Man hands Roscoe some money in exchange. \nThe SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves. \nSHERIFF Good day. \nFEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic man-to-man way. \nFEDORA You lost today, kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it. \nThen, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face. \nCLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT \nThe hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL GROWN INDIANA JONES. \nAnd... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back. \nFADE IN TITLE: \"PORTUGUESE COAST\u00971938\" \nPANAMA HAT Small world, Doctor Jones. \nINDY Too small for two of us. \nTHE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF CORONADO from Indy's belt. \nPANAMA HAT This is the second time I've had to reclaim my property from you\u0097 \nINDY That belongs in a museum\u0097 \nBRODY Yes. My treat. \nINT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY \nBursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: \"Professor Jones! \" \"Doctor Jonesl \" etc., etc. \nINDY Shush! Shush! Shushl \nINDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching Assistant named IRENE. \nIRENE Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're back! Your mail is on your desk. Here are your phone messages. \nMALE STUDENT Doctor Jones, you promised... Doctor Jones\u0097 \nIRENE This is your appointment schedule. And these term papers still haven't been graded. \nINDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students once again CLAMOR for his attention: \"Doctor Jones!\" \"Wait, Doctor Jonesl\" \"My grade!\" \"Sign my registration card!\" \nINDY silences the mob with a raised hand. \nINDY (very efficiently) Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn. \nThe Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into his - \nPRIVATE OFFICE \nwhere he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it. \nINDY (softly; reading) \"Venice, Italy.\" \nThen, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN. \nEXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY \nINDY escapes through the garden. \nEXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY \nINDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him. \nMAN (O.S.) Doctor Jonesl \nTHREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks \"G-MAN.\" The First Man steps behind Indy. \nMAN Doctor Jones? \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY \nINDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this opportunity to examine them. \nAfter a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC. \nDONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties, Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man. Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power. \nDONOVAN I trust your trip down was comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men didn't alarm you, I hope. \nHe shakes hands with INDY. \nDONOVAN My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan. \nINDY I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive. \nDONOVAN Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. (beat) Have a look over here. This might interest you. \nCONTINUED: \nDONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLET\u0097about two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols. \nINDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination. \nINDY Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think. \nDONOVAN That was our assessment as well. INDY Where did this come from? \nDONOVAN My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. (beat) Can you translate the inscription? \nTranslating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable as INDY. \nINDY (stumbling through it) \"... who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life. Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell. \nDonovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads. \nINDY Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the Temple where the cup that\u0097\" \nSuddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression. \nINDY \"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever. \" \n(CONT'D) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDONOVAN (reverently) The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea. \nINDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne DONOVAN now offers him. \nINDY The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before. DONOVAN Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. (beat) Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to! \nHe immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark. \nINDY (as he tears it open) Venice, Italy! \nBRODY What is it? \nINDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with great curiosity. \nINDY It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me? \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBRODY I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly. \nINDY Do you believe, Marcus? \nAs INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice. \nA SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands. \nINDY Do you believe the Grail actually exists? \nBRODY The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. \nBRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response. \nBRODY But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. \nINDY Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. \nBRODY I'll tell him we'll take two. \nEXT. AIRFIELD - DAY \nA LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY. \nBRODY Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice? \nDONOVAN (overlapping) Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you. \nCONTINUED: \nBRODY (overlapping) Schneider? \nDONOVAN (overlapping) I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal. \nBRODY Oh, well. That's good. Thank you. \nBRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand. \nDONOVAN Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very careful. Don't trust anvbody. \nINT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS. \nEXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice, Italy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY \nINDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water. \nINDY Ah, Venice... \nBRODY Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him? \nINDY I don't know. Maybe he'll know us. \nCONTINUED: \nSuddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent. \nELSA Doctor Jones? \nINDY Yes? \nELSA I knew it was you\u0097 \nShe looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious. \nELSA \u0097you have your father's eyes. \nINDY is instantly attracted to her. \nINDY And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you. \nELSA Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for. \nINDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat. \nELSA Marcus Brody? \nBRODY That's right. \nThe Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY. \nINDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back into his pocket. \nINDY (explaining to Brody) My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves. \nELSA Find something? \nINDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings\u0097charged with the thrill of discovery. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBRODY (to ELSA) Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals. \nELSA My God, I must be blind \nINDY Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itself \nELSA wears a blank expression. \nINDY Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look. \nINDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns. \nINDY Three. \nINDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points. \nINDY Three! \nINDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep up with him. \nINDY Seven. \nHe points again to the stained-glass window. \nINDY Seven... Ten. \nHe looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands. \nINDY And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten. \nINDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nINDY Three, seven and ten. He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge \"X\"\u0097visible only from this higher angle. \nINDY Ten. (wryly; to himself) \"X\" marks the spot. \nINDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot. \nINDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window. \nINDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously. INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library. \nFinally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED. \nCold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole. \nINDY Bingo. \nELSA You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father. \nINDY Except he's lost, and I'm not. \nELSA Lower me down. \nINDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably\u0097holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY. INDY Look after this for me, will you? \nThen INDY disappears into the hole. \nINT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY \nINDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA. \nINDY Come on. \nINDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank. foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design. \nINDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls. \nELSA Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century. \nINDY Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades. \nELSA The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later. \nINDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway. \nINDY That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him. \nINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nTHREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head. \nBRODY Ohhhh. . . \nKAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles. \nINDY It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet. \nThe missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield. \nELSA Just like your father\u0097giddy as a schoolboy. \nINDY laughs. \nELSA Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this? \nINDY (chuckles) He never would have made it past the rats!  He hates rats!  He's scared to death of them! \nCLOSE - A HAND \nas it lights a match. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water. \nINDY AND ELSA \nELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls. \nThis is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDY\u0097SHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach. \nThe rats literally wash over them\u0097like a rodent tidal wave\u0097in their efforts to escape a: \nHUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE \nROARING around the corner hurtling towards them\u0097feeding on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen. \nELSA SCREAMS. \nINDY Get back! Back against the wall. \nINDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water. \nINDY Quick! Under it! \nThey jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. \nINDY Air pocket! \nELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath. \nUNDER THE COFFIN \nELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and SPITTING. \nNow INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSA\u0097they are both soaking wet. \nINDY Don't wander off. \nCONTINUED: \nELSA What? \nINDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin. \nELSA What? \nUNDER THE WATER \nINDY swims, looking for an escape route. \nUNDER THE COFFIN \nThe rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror. \nINDY pops back up through the water. \nINDY I think I've found a way out. Deep breath. \nELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. \nEXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY \nThe perfect picture postcard\u0097St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond. Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles. \nINDY (wryly) Ah, Venicel \nIndy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns. \nHe grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP INTO A MOTORBOAT. \nINT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY \nINDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him. \nELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade punches. \nEXT. THE HARBOR - DAY \nIndy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of the DOCKED STEAMSHIP. \nKAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock. \nThey chase after INDY. \nINDY How dare he?! \nSimultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold. \nINT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY \nINDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway. APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it.. \nINDY reacts to the sight of them. \nINDY (to ELSA; softly) Nazis. I hate these guys. \nINDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens. \nINDY This one. I think he's in here. \nELSA How do you know? \nINDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE. \nINDY Because it's wired. \nHe studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the door\u0097there is no response. He looks back at ELSA and enters. \nINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY \nThe room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window\u0097 but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is several yards away. \nELSA Indy? Indy? \nINDY reassures her. \nINDY Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back. \nHe leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. \nHe gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight. \nEXT. THE CASTLE - DAY \nINDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle. \nCLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE \nA PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window. \nINDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet... swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise. \nINT. THE ROOM - DAY \nINDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window. \nNo sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. \nStunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES, steps out of the shadows. \nHENRY Junior? \nINDY gets to his feet. \nINDY (a reflex) Yes, sirl \nCONTINUED: \nThis reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other. \nHENRY It is you Junior! \nINDY (an old familiar irritation) Don't call me that, please. \nHENRY (amazed) But what are you doing here? \nINDY I came to get you! What do you think? \nNAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand. \nINDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look. \nHENRY (sotto, mumbled) Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty. \nHENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments. \nHENRY Oh, it breaks the heart. \nINDY (quietly to himself) And the head. (to HENRY, aggrievedly) You hit me, Dad! \nHENRY (referring to the vase) I'll never forgive myself\u0097 \nINDY (surprised, misunderstanding) Don't worry\u0097I'm fine. \nHENRY Thank God! \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the broken end carefully. \nHENRY ... it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section. \nSINISTER MAN Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you. \nBRODY takes off his hat. \nBRODY Oh, what?... your servant, sir. \nSALLAH And I am his. \nSINISTER MAN Follow me, please. \nThe man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them. \nBRODY My reputation precedes me. \nSALLAH There is no museum in Iskenderun. \nThe SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly. \nSECOND MAN Papers please. \nSALLAH Papers? (laughs) Of course. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY. \nSALLAH Run. \nBRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers. \nBRODY Yes. \nSALLAH Papers, sir. Got it here. \nSALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper. \nSALLAH Just finished reading it myself. (laughs; then, to Brody) Run! \nBRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN. \nBRODY Yes. \nSALLAH Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. (to Brody) Run! \nBRODY Did you say...? Uh, uh... \nSALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper. \nSALLAH Run! \nThe SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact. \nSALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets. \nSALLAH (to Brody; pointing) Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that door! \nSALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nThen\u0097METAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK. \nSALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside. \nINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY \nThe room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates one wall. \nThe NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs. ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters. \nHENRY Intolerable. \nVOGEL Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture. \nELSA So? \nVOGEL Your presence on the platform is requested... at the highest level. \nELSA Thank you, Herr Oberst. (to DONOVAN) I will meet you at Iskenderun. \nDONOVAN Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin. It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. Without a map, I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir. \nHe hands her the Grail Diary. \nVOGEL (to DONOVAN, meaning Indy and Henry) Let me kill them now. \nCONTINUED: \nELSA No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive. \nDONOVAN (to VOGEL, with a helpless shrug) Always do what the doctor orders. \nDONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY. \nELSA Don't look at me like that\u0097we both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same. \nINDY shakes his head \"no.\" \nINDY Dad! \nHENRY What? \nINDY Dad! \nHENRY What? \nINDY Dad! \nFinally they turn their heads in the same direction. \nHENRY What? \nINDY Head for the fireplace! \nHENRY Oh. \nBANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE FIREPLACE\u0097the only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE. \nCONTINUED: \nINDY I think I can get these ropes off. \nIndy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door. \nINDY Whoopsl \nThe fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find themselves in the: \nINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY \nwhere a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials, switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY. \nThe floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in: \nINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY \ninside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back. \nHENRY Our situation has not improved. \nINDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY. \nINDY Listen Dad... I'm almost free. \nINDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to: \nINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY \nFOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She screams. \nWOMAN Alarm! \nNow the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY. \nWOMAN Schnel!! \nTWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY \nINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN \nINDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet, drapes and furniture are all ablaze. \nHENRY This is intolerable! \nINDY I'm out, Dad! \nINDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father. \nHENRY Well done, boy! \nINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY \nAll FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door. \nINT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY \nThe RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other side\u0097but there is NO SIGN OF INDY AND HENRY. \nThe RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY escaped through these flames? \nNot a chance. \nThey've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN, BEHIND the RADIOMEN. \nOne of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY behind. \nHENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS rush forward to him. \nINT. RADIO ROOM - DAY \nINDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place, sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room. \nINT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY \nVogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO MORE NAZIS fall into step with him. \nTHE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE \ndrives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse, COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM. \nThe remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen comrades and continues the chase. \nINDY AND HENRY \nAs the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun, preparing to fire. \nINDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel. \nThe NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into the air. \nCONTINUED: \nINDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the way to BERLIN or VENEDIG. \nIndy starts down the road marked VENEDIG. \nHENRY Stop! \nINDY What? \nHENRY Stop! Stop! \nThe motorbike skids to a stop. \nHENRY You're going the wrong Way!  We have to get to Berlin! \nINDY (pointing towards Venedig) Brody's this way. \nHENRY My Diary's in Berlin. \nINDY You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map. \nHENRY There is more in the Diary than just the map. \nINDY All right Dad\u0097tell me. \nHENRY Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge. \nINDY What final challenge? \nHENRY Three devices of such lethal cunning. \nINDY Booby traps? \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHENRY Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm. \nINDY But what are they? Can't you remember? \nHENRY I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember \nINDY Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den? \nHENRY Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail. \nINDY What about Marcus? \nHENRY Marcus would agree with me. \nINDY Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christl \nHENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself. \nHENRY That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me? \nINDY This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom. \nHENRY Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAY \nArrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN. \nEXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT \nA Nazi Rally\u0097a book-burning is in process. \nThe mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire. \nFlags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd. \nINDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunic\u0097which happens to be several sizes too big. \nHENRY My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land. \nThen... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to: \nTHE PODIUM \nwhere high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as they oversee the rally. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nINDY (O.S.) Fahrscheine, bitte. \nMALE PASSENGER Nein. \nVOGEL turns to see: \nINDY \nWEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD. \nMALE PASSENGER (O.S.) Ich habe ihn night gesehen. \nINDY Tickets please. \nThe Passengers do not react to the request, made in English. \nINDY Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte. \nVOGEL \napproaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face. \nVOGEL Guten Tag, Herr Jones. \nNow INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket. \nINDY Fahrscheine meine Herr. \nVOGEL Weg. \nINDY Tickets please. \nHENRY looks confused. \nVOGEL (in German) Was? \nVOGEL glances up and recognizes INDY\u0097who quickly punches Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below. \nShocked Passengers blink in bewilderment. \nINDY (in German; with a shrug) No ticket. \nEveryone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face. \nEXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY \nVOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin. \nVOGEL Du wirst nochmal boren von mir! \nINT. ZEPPELIN - DAY \nINDY and HENRY together again in their compartment. \nHENRY You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience. \nCONTINUED: \nINDY (meaning ELSA) That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather! \nHENRY Well, I'm as human as the next man. \nINDY I was the next man. \nHENRY (laughs) Ships that pass in the night... \nHENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it. \nINDY Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake. \nHENRY Hmmm... What did we talk about? \nINDY We didn't talk. We never talked. \nHENRY And do I detect a rebuke? \nINDY A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that. \nHENRY Actually, I was a wonderful father. \nINDY When? \nHENRY looks up from his Diary. \nHENRY Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- reliance. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nINDY What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years. \nHENRY You left just when you were becoming interesting. \nINDY Dad, how can you --? \nHENRY (interrupting) Very well. I'm here now. \nHe closes the Diary and leans back in his seat. \nINDY Thanks. \nSuddenly, INDY's attention is directed to: \nTWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS \ncoming in low. Guns BLAZING. \nAs BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy. \nHENRY Those people are trying to kill us! \nINDY I know, Dadl \nHENRY It's a new experience for me. \nINDY It happens to me all the time. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nAn OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire. \nTHE MAN \nturns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man. \nINT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY \nINDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. HENRY is a very nervous passenger. \nINDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE MIRROR. \nAs the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them, narrowly missing the car. \nHENRY This is intolerable! \nINDY This could be close. \nEXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY \nThe car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE. \nThe Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING. \nThe car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS. \nINT. THE TUNNEL - DAY \nThe FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel. \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nIndy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE gaining on them; about to overtake them. \nHENRY Faster, boy --faster! \nEXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY \nThe car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and EXPLODES in the middle of the road. \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nAs the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow. \nHENRY Well, they don't come any closer than that! \nHENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them. \nEXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY \nThe MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet. \nTHE CAR \nFALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nINDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY. \nINDY Dad, he's coming back. \nINDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to: \nA DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY \nINDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the chamber\u0097the GUN HAS NO BULLETS. \nTHE MESSERSCHMIDT \nswings around and is coming in for another pass. \nINDY AND HENRY \nexchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY. \nVOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink. \nVOGEL We must be within three or four miles. Otherwise we are off the map. \nCONTINUED: \nHe hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to DONOVAN. \nDONOVAN Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind. \nBRODY You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend. \nHENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies. \nINDY Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun. \nThen Donovan notices a reflection from the hills. \nWhat he sees is: \nTHE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS \nHENRY What do you think you're doing?! Get down! \nINDY Dad, we're well out of range. \nAt that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction. \nIt WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them. \nSALLAH That car belonged to my brother- in-law. \nINDY (gesturing to the others) Come on--come on! \nEXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY \nVOGEL I can't see anyone up there. \nCONTINUED: \nDONOVAN Maybe it wasn't even Jones. \nELSA No. It's him all right. He's here somewhere. \nDONOVAN (to VOGEL) Put Brody in the tank. \nKAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below. \nDONOVAN (to ELSA) Well, in this sun, without transportation, they're as good as dead. \nBULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck. \nA NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him. \nKAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car. \nDONOVAN It's Jones, all right. \nANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP \nINDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them. \nHENRY Now, who are all these people? \nINDY Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation. \nCUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. \nTWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. \nThe battle continues\u0097a fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides. \nINDY AND SALLAH \ncrouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses. \nINDY I'm going after those horses. \nSALLAH I'll take the camels. \nINDY I don't need camels. \nSALLAH But, Indy\u0097 \nINDY No camels! \nDONOVAN AND ELSA \nThey look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. ELSA looks saddened. \nDONOVAN (re KAZIM) Who is he? \nKAZIM A messenger from God. For the unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation. \nKAZIM dies. \nINDY \nINDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far. Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow. \nPOV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT \nVOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with INDY. \nCleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon. \nThe tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon on the turret. \nINDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is. \nINT. TANK- DAY \nVOGEL shouts to the Gunner. \nVOGEL Der Kubelwagon sprengen! \nThe Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY \nINDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun. \nINT. TANK - DAY \nA NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window. \nNAZI SOLDIER Keine Bewegung. \nHe points his gun at HENRY and BRODY. \nNAZI SOLDIER Keine Bewegung. \nThe smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke. \nBRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke. \nEXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY \nINDY rides his horse alongside the tank. \nINDY Dad!  Dad!  Dad! \nINT. TANK - DAY \nHENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER. \nHENRY Junior? Junior? Junior! \nThe NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat. \nEXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY \nSmoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges and aims his gun at INDY. \nINDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse. \nINDY pulls the trigger again\u0097his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail. \nNow INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank. \nCLOSE UP - VOGEL \nHate-staring at INDY \nCLOSE UP - INDY \nHate-staring back at VOGEL. \nSuddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy. \nCUT TO: \nSIDE ANGLE \nOne of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY. \nINDY is struggling with a German's Luger. \nINDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief. Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs INDY. They struggle and fall. \nINDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's neck. \nINT. TANK- DAY \nINDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by VOGEL. \nINDY Dad! \nHe drops the gun down into the tank. \nINDY Dad! Dadl Get it! \nVOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck. \nEXT. TANK - DAY \nA NAZI SOLDIER approaches. \nHENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to his assistance. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nINDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes. \nDONOVAN points the gun at him: \nDONOVAN You can't save him when you're dead. \nINDY hesitates. \nDONOVAN The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now. It's time to ask yourself what you believe. \nINDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shots\u0097ELSA\u0097SALLAH\u0097BRODY\u0097DONOVAN\u0097registering their different emotions \nINDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary. \nINDY \"The Breath of God... Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass. . . \" \nINDY takes a few steps forward. \nINDY \"The penitent man will pass. The penitent man...\" \nINDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died. \nHENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry. \nHENRY (in a raspy voice) \"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.\" \nINDY (quietly to himself) The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man... \nHENRY The penitent man. The penitent... \nINDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nINDY The penitent man is humble before God. \nHENRY Penitent. Penitent... \nINDY The penitent man is humble... \nThe cobwebs begin to move.... \nINDY He kneels before God. (to himself; suddenly) Kneel!! \nWe hear the awful rush of air\u0097WHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face. \nInstinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM. \nINDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn\u0097the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe. \nINDY I'm through! \nELSA AND DONOVAN \nDONOVAN We're through! \nBRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved. \nSALLAH (to HENRY) He's all right. \nHENRY shakes his head. \nHENRY No. \nBACK TO INDY \nholding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs. \nINDY \"The second challenge is the Word of God. Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed.\" (to himself) The Word of God... The Word of... \nINDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter. \nINDY \"Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.\" \nHENRY \nlifts his head painfully. \nHENRY The Word of God... \nBRODY No, Henry. Try not to talk. \nHENRY The Name of God... \nBACK TO INDY \nas he studies the cobblestones before him. \nINDY The Name of God... Jehovahl \nHENRY \nstill lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him. \nKNIGHT I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. \nThe GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY. \nINDY (gulp) Listen, I don't have time to explain, but\u0097 \nAt that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups. \nDONOVAN Which one is it? \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKNIGHT You must choose. (beat) But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life\u0097 the False Grail will take it from you. \nDONOVAN I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it? \nELSA Let me choose. \nDONOVAN Thank you, Doctor. \nELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors. \nELSA chooses a cup\u0097a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. \nDONOVAN instantly takes it from her. \nDONOVAN Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings. \nDONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water. \nDONOVAN Eternal life! \nDONOVAN drinks from the goblet. \nThen, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA. \nDONOVAN What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .? \nHe starts to age\u0097fast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes. \nELSA gasps and screams. \nDONOVAN What. . . is . . . happening. . . ? \nHis skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nINDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL. \nKNIGHT He chose...poorly. \nINDY studies the array of chalices. \nELSA It would not be made out of gold. \nINDY picks up another cup\u0097a simple earthenware jug. \nINDY That's the cup of a carpenter. \nHe and ELSA exchange a look. \nINDY There's only one way to find out. \nINDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows. \nA strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal. \nKNIGHT You have chosen wisely. But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. That is the boundary and the price of immortality. \nCUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return. \nINDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail. \nThe TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put down their guns and kneel. \nINDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips. \nHENRY is too weak to even open his eyes. \nHENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns to Henry's face. \nHENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then they shift to INDY's face\u0097and they light up even more... \nNAZI SOLDIERS \nrun forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them. \nSALLAH Drop your guns. Please. \nThe NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender. \nINDY (to HENRY) Dad, come on. Get to your feet. \nELSA \nsteps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with possession of the Grail. \n", "test1_input": "KAZIM In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. \nKAZIM walks away. \nINT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY \nCLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from the shield of the Grail Knight. \nBRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack. \nINDY How's the head? \nBRODY It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. \"Alexandretta?\" Hmmm... \nINDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression. \nINDY The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed. \nBRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY. \nINDY The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus\u0097 you remember what the Grail Tablet said. \"Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.\" (pause) But where exactly? \nCONTINUED: \nBRODY Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map. \nBRODY picks up the Grail Diary. \nBRODY He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest. A map with no names. \nINSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP \nIt covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it. \nBRODY Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. \nINDY (solemnly) Alexandretta. Now we know. \nBRODY Yes. Now we know. \nINDY (rising) Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun. \nINDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe. \nBRODY What about you? \nINDY I'm going after Dad. \nINT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nINDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nINDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks. \nINDY Elsa? \nHe goes in. \nINT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY \n... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The room is empty. \nHe is worried for her, knocks and calls out: \nINDY Elsa? \nHe steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door. INDY Elsa? \nHe opens the bathroom door, peering inside. \nINDY Elsa? \nINT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub. \nINT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock. \nELSA My room! \nINDY Mine, too. \nELSA What were they looking for? \nShe looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket. \nINDY This. \nCONTINUED: \nELSA The Grail Diary. \nINDY Uh-huh. \nELSA You had it? You didn't trust me! \n", "test1_true": "INDY I didn't know you. \nShe's awfully hard to resist. \nINDY At least I let you tag along. \nELSA Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere. \nINDY Knock it off. You're not mad. \nELSA No? \nINDY No. You like the way I do things. \nELSA It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier. \nShe stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy grabs her. \nINDY Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHe pulls her to him and kisses her. \nELSA How dare you kiss me! \nNow ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him. \nINDY Leave me alone. I don't like fast women. \nBut he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear. \nELSA And I hate arrogant men. \nINDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed. \nEXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY \nA GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past Indy's window. \nINT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nINDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the GONDOLIER SINGING. \nINDY Ahh, Venice. \nELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her. \nEXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY \nA Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. This is SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course from Venice across Austria toward Salzburg. \nEXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY \nStorm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the formidable stone castle. \nINDY What do you know about this place? \nELSA I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors. \nINT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY \nINDY reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip. \nELSA What are you going to do? \nINDY Don't know. Think of something. \nHe glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it. \nINT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY \nA BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal INDY and ELSA standing outside in the rain. she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret. \nBUTLER Yes? \nINDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He adopts a Scottish accent. \nINDY And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're drenched! \nAs INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY SNEEZES HARD. \nINDY Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle. \nINDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused amazement. \nBUTLER (coldly; with Austrian accent) Are you expected? \nINDY Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries. \n(CONT'D) \nCONTINUED: BUTLER Tapestries? \nINDY Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries? \nBUTLER This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse. \n", "test2_input": "HENRY I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers. \nINDY (overlapping) Will you take it easy....! \nHENRY Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? (points towards the NAZIS) So it wouldn't fall into their hands!! \nINDY I came here to save you. \nHENRY Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? \nINDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad. \nINDY I told you-- \nHe turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room. \nINDY --don't call me Junior! \nHENRY looks shocked and horrified. \nHENRY Look what you did!! \nIndy grabs him and pushes him ahead. \nHENRY (aghast) I can't believe what you just.... \nINT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY \nINDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa. \nINDY Elsa? Elsa? \nHe opens a door and enters: \nINT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY \nINDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE. \nHis name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her ear. \nVOGEL That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies. \nHENRY But she's one of them! \nELSA Indy, please! \nHENRY She's a Nazi! \nINDY What?! \nINDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once: \nHENRY Trust me! \nELSA Indy, no! \nVOGEL I will kill her! \nHENRY Oh yeah? Go ahead! \nINDY No! Don't Shoot! \nCONTINUED: \nHENRY (to Indy) Don't worry. He won't. \nELSA Indy, please! Do what he says! \nHENRY And don't listen to her! \nVOGEL Enough! She diesl \nVOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS. \nINDY Wait!  Waitl \nAnd then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly. \nVOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest. \nELSA I'm sorry. \nINDY comforts her. \nINDY No, don't be. \nHer hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary. \nELSA But you should have listened to your father. \nShe steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most withering look of reprimand. \nINT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY \nA large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor. Firelight\u0097from the giant fireplace\u0097dances across the ceiling and walls. \nINDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS. \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: \nINDY (quietly to HENRY) She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi? \nHENRY Umh? \nINDY How did you she was a Nazi? \nHENRY She talks in her sleep. \nINDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY with surprise. \nHENRY I didn't trust her. Why did you? \nMAN IN CHAIR Because he didn't take my advice. \nThe MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be... WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions. \nINDY Donovan DONOVAN Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones? \nDONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary. \nHENRY I misjudged you Walter\u0097I knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase. But I didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity. \nDONOVAN (suddenly erupting) Doctor Schneider There're pages torn out of thisl \nELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herself\u0097then glances up at Indy. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nELSA This book contained a map\u0097a map with no names\u0097precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon. \nINDY So it did. \nDONOVAN Where are these missing pages? This maps we must have these pages backs \nHENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks. \nELSA (to Donovan) You're wasting your breath. He won't tell us. And he doesn't have to... it's perfectly obvious where the pages are... (looking at Indy) ... he's given them to Marcus Brody. \nHENRY now wears a pained expression. \nHENRY (to Indy) Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you? He's not up to the challenge. \nDONOVAN He sticks out like a sore thumb. We'll find him. \nINDY The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs. (beat) Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already. \nHENRY looks amazed and impressed. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY \nBRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross- section of ARABS and TUSKS. \nBRODY Does anyone here speak English? Or even ancient Greek? \nA Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY. \nBRODY No water, no thank you. No, fish make love in it. \nBRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman holds a chicken out to him. \nBRODY Thank you so much. No, I don't like that. No, I really don't want... No, no, thank you very much. No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian. \nThe Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd. \nBRODY Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here? \nSALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY. \nSALLAH Mister Brodyl \nThey meet and hug, then begin to walk. \nBRODY Oh, Sallahl What a relief! \nSALLAH (laughs) Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy? \nBRODY (overlapping) Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour. \nSALLAH You are on your own? \nA Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away. \nCONTINUED: \nBRODY Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you. . .have you arranged our supplies? \nSALLAH Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going? \nBRODY Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh... \nBRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches. \nSINISTER MAN Mister Brody? \nBRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and bows quickly. \n", "test3_input": "As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air. \nThe BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers. \nEXT. TANK - DAY \nINDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank. \nINDY Dad? \nHENRY You call this archaeology? \nINDY Get out of there, Dad! \nINDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm. \nBRODY How does one get off this thing? \nAs INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down. \nINT. TANK - DAY \nVogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor. \nEXT. TANK- DAY \nHENRY (to INDY) Where's Marcus?! \nBefore INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving tread. \nINDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside. \nAs HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle. \nINDY Dad! \nHENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip. \nINDY Hang on, Dad! \nSALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY. \nSALLAH Father of Indy\u0097give me your hand! \nVOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, INDY refuses to let go of the whip. \nINDY Sallah! Get Dadl \nSALLAH reaches out to HENRY. \nSALLAH Give me your hand! \nSALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. \nINDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head. \nINDY \nlooks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge. \nVOGEL \nHe sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top of his lungs! \nLONG SHOT \nThe tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM. \nEXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY \nHENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank. \nHENRY Junior?! \nWe HEAR the TANK EXPLODING. \nSALLAH Indy?! \nHENRY Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough. \nAnd then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. \nFinally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. \nHENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him. \nHENRY I thought I'd lost you, boy. \nAfter a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long time\u0097if ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back. \nINDY I thought you had too, sir. \nBRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation. \nHENRY Well\u0097well done! Come on! \nHENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge. \n", "test3_true": "Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to see INDY still sitting on the ground. \nHENRY Let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? Come on\u0097 let's go! \nHENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nDONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA. \nDONOVAN The Canyon of the Crescent Moon. \nNow ELSA peers through the binoculars. \nEXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY \nINDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger. \nNow we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles, camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TEMPLE - DAY \nINDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see: \nTHE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER \nHe's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath. What's going on here? \nFULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE \nTHE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter. \nELSA AND DONOVAN \nwatch him from a safe distance. \nTHE TURK \nis about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED. \nTHE TURK stops\u0097only one step away from the beheaded soldier. \nTHE TURK \ntakes one more step\u0097a fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROAR\u0097A WHOOSH of air\u0097but we SEE NOTHING\u0097except THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND BOUNCE across the ground. \nINDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH \nreact to the sight. \nELSA AND DONOVAN \nShe looks at him, horrified. \nDONOVAN Helmut, another volunteer! \nTWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly... \nThe SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns. \nFULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE \nINDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers. \nELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues more coldly. \nELSA (to INDY) I never expected to see you again. \nINDY I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up. \nDONOVAN Step back now, Doctor Schneider. Give Doctor Jones some room. He's going to recover the Grail for us. \nCONTINUED: \nINDY laughs. \nDONOVAN Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history? \nINDY As what? A Nazi stooge like you? \nDONOVAN (scornfully) Nazis?!\u0097Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo. (he draws his pistol) The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me. \nINDY Shooting me won't get you anywhere. \nDONOVAN You know something, Doctor Jones?... you're absolutely right. \nThen DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters his side below the ribs. \nINDY Dad?! \nHENRY Junior. . . \nELSA No!! \nDONOVAN ( to ELSA) Get back! \n"}

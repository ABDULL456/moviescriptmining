{"test1_input": "PANAMA HAT Come on. Get him! \nINDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it. \nSpeeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin pumping. \nINDY VEERS OFF in a new direction\u0097toward a RAILROAD TRACK. \nEXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY \nThe train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN. \nHe clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from the truck onto the train. \nHALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar. \nINDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still running after him, Indy enters the trap door of... \nINT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY \nand finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc. \nCONTINUED: \nThen, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap door\u0097followed by ROUGH RIDER. Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp. \nINDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes. \nThe combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING. \nEveryone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car. \nHe lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye- to-eye with an\u0097 \nENORMOUS ANACONDA \nThe head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. \nINDY Oh... \nINDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT. \nINDY Oh... Oh... \nHundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him. \nINDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself. \nINDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape. \nHALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans. ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him. \nROUGH RIDER Here, let me. \nEXT. THE TRAIN- DAY \nINDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and tosses it away. \nROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to... \nEXT. A FLATCAR - DAY \nINDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar. \nINT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY \nas a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE BLACK RHINOCEROS. \nEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY \nROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE. \nIN THE BOXCAR BELOW \n... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF. \nBACK TO THE ROOFTOP \nas the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. SMASH! The horn comes up again\u0097RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS. \nINDY Holy smokes! \nINDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach. \nEXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY \nThe WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car. \nEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY \nINDY gets to his feet\u0097looks ahead\u0097sees a WATER TANK alongside the track directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea... \nIn an instant, he calculates his approach\u0097times the distance\u0097and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT. \nCONTINUED: \nHe catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see FEDORA walking toward him. \n", "test1_true": "As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below. \nINT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY \nINDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises. \nINDY Ohhh! \nINDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards. \nThen INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight. \nAnd INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall... \nINDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY. \nINDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin. \nThe Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and tries again. This time\u0097success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back. \nINDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs away even more. Indy inches forward\u0097bends down (never taking his eyes off the Lion)\u0097picks up the Cross\u0097and steps back again, sweat pouring down his face. \nBut now... how to get out? \nHe looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand. \nFEDORA Toss up the whip. \nEXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR \nFEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, \"reels\" INDY out of the Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams. \nThe men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction. \nFEDORA You've got heart, kid. (indicates Cross) But that belongs to me. \nINDY (takes Cross from his belt) It belongs to Coronado. \nFEDORA (overlapping) Coronado is dead. And so are all his grandchildren. \nINDY This should be in a museum. \nROSCOE Now give me thatl \nROSCOE makes a grab for the Cross\u0097but INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS AROUND Roscoe's hand. \nROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER\u0097releases his grip on the Cross and tries to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO THE NEXT CAR. \nFEDORA Don't let him get awayl \nINDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading \"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE.\" \nINDY Magic? \nHe glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside. \nFEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY. \nFEDORA Hold it. Make sure he doesn't double back. \nINT. THE CABOOSE - DAY \nwhich contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC BOX. \nFEDORA Okay, kid. out of the box. Now. \nFEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely vanished. \nFEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back. He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees: \nINDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses. \nFEDORA Damn. \nEXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY \nas INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name \"JONES\" painted on the mailbox. \nINDY Dad! \nINT. THE HOUSE - DAY \nINDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father. \nINDY Dad! \nINDY Dad! \nINT. THE STUDY - DAY \nINDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies. \nPROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook. \nCONTINUED: \nWe never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene. So INDY CHARGES IN. \n", "test1_id": 2913, "test2_input": "INDY Dad! \nHENRY Out! \nINDY It's important! \nHENRY Then wait\u0097count to twenty. \nINDY No, Dad. You listen to me\u0097 \nHENRY (now he shouts) Junior! \nNo question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says \"What am I going to do with this guy?\" And obeys\u0097 starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY. \nINDY One, two, three, four... \nNow we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand sketching; then, he holds up one finger. \nHENRY In Greek. \nINDY's reaction: \nINDY (louder, in Greek) One... two... three... four... \nAn ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat. HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET. \nINDY's reaction: Trouble! \nHENRY is just finishing the sketch. \nHENRY May he who illuminated this... illuminate me... \nINT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY \nThe study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet. \nINDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman continues to spit\u0097right into Indy's face. Indy flinches. \nHERMAN I brought the Sheriff. \nHERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house. \nINDY Just the man I want to see! Now, there were five or six of them. \nSHERIFF (interrupting) All right, son. \nINDY (overlapping) ... they came after... me... \nSHERIFF You still got it? \nINDY Well, yes, sir. It's right here! \nINDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually. \nSHERIFF I'm glad to see that... because the rightful owner of this Cross won't press charges, if you give it back. \nFEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED. He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a friendly manner. \nSHERIFF He's got witnesses, five or six of them. \nThe SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots \nThe SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from Fedora, then runs out the door. \nROSCOE Yahoo! \nCONTINUED: \nAs ROSCOE runs outside INDY sees\u0097through the screen door\u0097the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front. Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Cross\u0097the Man hands Roscoe some money in exchange. \nThe SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves. \nSHERIFF Good day. \nFEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic man-to-man way. \nFEDORA You lost today, kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it. \nThen, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face. \nCLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT \nThe hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL GROWN INDIANA JONES. \nAnd... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back. \nFADE IN TITLE: \"PORTUGUESE COAST\u00971938\" \nPANAMA HAT Small world, Doctor Jones. \nINDY Too small for two of us. \nTHE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF CORONADO from Indy's belt. \nPANAMA HAT This is the second time I've had to reclaim my property from you\u0097 \nINDY That belongs in a museum\u0097 \n", "test2_true": "THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP \nIt's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA. Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck. \nThe TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back) propel INDY across the deck toward the rail. \nAs they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold the drums together. \nINDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT. \nPANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from Panama Hat. \nA sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides. \nINDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it. \nHe SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him. \nSEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all. \nPANAMA HAT Grab him, he's getting away! Grab him! \nIndy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky. \nLONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER \nas bits of debris fall from the sky like rain. \nINDY BOBS UP \nin the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver. \nCONTINUED: \nOnly now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the destroyed ship's name and city of port: \nVAZQUEZ de CORONADO BARCELONA \nA SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past. \nEXT. COLLEGE - DAY Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths. \nINDY (V.O .) Archaeology is... \nINT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINDY, dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He turns to the blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word: \"FACT.\" \nINDY ... the search for fact. Not truth. If it's truth you're interested in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy class is right down the hall. \nLaughter. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nINDY So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. Eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and \"X\" never, ever, marks the spot. \nMARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in the door to see INDY completing his lecture. \nINDY Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library. Research. Reading. \nINT. LECTURE HALL - DAY \nBRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room. \nCONTINUED: \nINDY We cannot afford to take mythology at face value. \nThe BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk. \nINDY Next week: \"Egyptology.\" Starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems for the next hour and a half. \nBRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall. \nINDY Marcus! (slaps his pocket) I did it! \nBRODY You've got itl \nINDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross. \nINDY You know how long I've been looking for that?! \nBRODY All your life. \nINDY All my life! \nBRODY Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection. \nINDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door. \nINDY We can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight. \nHe turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross. \nINDY Your treat. \n", "test2_id": 2914, "test3_input": "INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back into his pocket. \nINDY (explaining to Brody) My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves. \nELSA Find something? \nINDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings\u0097charged with the thrill of discovery. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBRODY (to ELSA) Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals. \nELSA My God, I must be blind \nINDY Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itself \nELSA wears a blank expression. \nINDY Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look. \nINDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns. \nINDY Three. \nINDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points. \nINDY Three! \nINDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep up with him. \nINDY Seven. \nHe points again to the stained-glass window. \nINDY Seven... Ten. \nHe looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands. \nINDY And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten. \nINDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nINDY Three, seven and ten. He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge \"X\"\u0097visible only from this higher angle. \nINDY Ten. (wryly; to himself) \"X\" marks the spot. \nINDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot. \nINDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window. \nINDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously. INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library. \nFinally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED. \nCold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole. \nINDY Bingo. \nELSA You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father. \nINDY Except he's lost, and I'm not. \nELSA Lower me down. \nINDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably\u0097holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY. INDY Look after this for me, will you? \nThen INDY disappears into the hole. \nINT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY \nINDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA. \nINDY Come on. \nINDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank. foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design. \nINDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls. \nELSA Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century. \nINDY Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades. \nELSA The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later. \nINDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway. \nINDY That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him. \nINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nTHREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head. \nBRODY Ohhhh. . . \nKAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles. \n", "test3_true": "DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones. \nINDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls. \nCONTINUED: \nELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows away some cobwebs: \nELSA What's this one? \nINDY only has to give it a quick glance to know. \nINDY The Ark of the Covenant. \nELSA Are you sure? \nINDY (deadpan) Pretty sure. \nINDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway. \nANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS \nINDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL \"X.\" \nINDY Watch out. \nELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room. \nANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS \nas INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches. ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall. \nINDY Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire. \nINDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water. \nINDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water. \nINDY Give me the lighter. \nANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS \nUsing the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING. Squirming. Thrashing in the water. \nINDY Oh, rats... \nELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs. \nINDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa. \nINDY Come onl \nShe gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves forward. \nTHE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL \nKAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water. \nANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS \nMore rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through another passageway lined with skulls and bones. \nINDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. \nHe takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same. \nINDY Come here. \nLARGE BURIAL CHAMBER \nThe chamber is flooded with black, briny water. INDY Look. . . \nIn the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an \"island altar\" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the altar. \nCONTINUED: \nINDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass. \nINDY It must be one of these... \nELSA Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork. \nOne coffin is elevated above the others. \nELSA It's this one. \nTogether they begin to push on the lid\u0097STRAINING and GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone platform. \nINSIDE THE COFFIN \nlie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look in...Elsa gasps. \nINDY This is itl we found it! Look\u0097 the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker! \nINDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield. \nELSA What's that? \n", "test3_id": 2915}

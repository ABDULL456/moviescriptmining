LEGOLAS [Fires two arrows] Nineteen! 
[The Ent Moot is still in progress. The Ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits.] 
PIPPIN [Gesturing] Merry! 
TREEBEARD We have just agreed. [Long pause with his eyes closed.] 
MERRY [Angles his head in query] Yes? 
TREEBEARD I have told your names to the Ent moot and we have agreed  you are not Orcs. 
PIPPIN Well, thats good news. 
MERRY [impatiently] And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about HIM? 
TREEBEARD [Waving a hand] Now dont be hasty, Master Meriadoc. 
MERRY Hasty? Our friends are out there! They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own. 
TREEBEARD War, yes It affects us all. But you must understand, young hobbit. It takes a loong time to say anything in ooold Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a looong time to say. 
[Gimli is standing on the wall between two ladders, hacking away at Uruk-hai as they come up] 
GIMLI Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one! Twenty-two! 
[Camera pans over the Uruk-hai below and turns to the Causeway. A group of Uruk-hai is advancing on the Causeway towards the gate in tortoise formation, using their broad shields to block off attacks.] 
ARAGORN Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs the Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.] 
[The Elf archers release their arrows. The Uruk-hai at the sides are shot and fall down the Causeway. But the column keeps advancing.] 
THÉODEN Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman? 
[At the bottom of the Deeping Wall, two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate. The rest opens a path and an Uruk-hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate. Aragorn spots the Uruk-hai.] 
ARAGORN Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down, Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him! Kill him!) 
[Legolas shoots the Uruk again. It stumbles and then throws it self and the torch at the bombs. An enormous explosion is set off, blowing away a large part of the wall. Rock, debris and bodies are thrown up. Aragorn is also thrown back by the force of the explosion and on the ground, knocked out. Théoden looks on in shock as the Uruk-hai streams in past the Deeping Walls.] 
THÉODEN Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm! 
[Gimli sees the Uruk-hai charging in with Aragorn in their path. With a cry, he jumps down from the wall and lands on the Uruk-hai army, taking them out as he stands.] 
GIMLI Aragorn!! Argh! 
[He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets up and sees Gimli falling.] 
ARAGORN Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind him] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!) 
[The arrows take out the first group of Uruk-hai coming through the hole in the wall.] 
ARAGORN Herio! (Charge!) 
[Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He rushes to Gimlis side and picks him up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground. He then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom.]

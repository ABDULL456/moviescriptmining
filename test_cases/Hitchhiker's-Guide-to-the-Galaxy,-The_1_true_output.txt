Ford struggles, shoves it back in Arthur's ear again. 
JELTZ (CONT'D) ...and this is not a taxi service for degenerate freeloaders. 
The door BURSTS open. A VOGON GUARD enters. Grabs Ford and Arthur. They struggle. 
VOGON GUARD Resistance is useless! 
The struggle continues. As they're dragged out the door, Arthur continues to try to yank the fish out of his ear. Ford wrestles with him, trying to keep it in. 
GUIDE VOICE The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. 
26      INT. VOGON SHIP CORRIDOR.                                     26 
A bleak corridor. The Vogon guard pushes a still struggling Arthur and Ford down it. 
GUIDE VOICE It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language. 
Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal window. He backs up to look out. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable thing that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved in the Universe purely by chance that many thinkers have chosen to see this as a final clinching proof of the NON-existence of God. 
26a     ARTHUR'S POV -- of space through the window, beautiful        26a purple-orange clouds of swirling stars and gasses. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The argument goes something like this... "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."

It's finally sinking in -- he's in deep space. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) "But," says Man, "the Babelfish is a dead give-away. It proves you exist, and so therefore you don't. QED." "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic. 
The guard yanks Arthur away, pushes him forward with Ford. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book, 'WELL THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP FOR GOD.' 
Arthur looks lost and confused. They approach a set of double doors. He stops. The Guard shoves him forward. 
VOGON GUARD Resistance is useless! 
ARTHUR Ford... 
FORD Don't panic. If we're lucky, they'll throw us out into space. 
ARTHUR And if we're unlucky? 
Off Ford's apprehensive look we CUT TO... 
27       INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        27 
Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars with hundreds of elastic bands. 
A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM! 
Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it. We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone (like ones used to introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is. He faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " -- smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry. 
JELTZ Oh freddled gruntbuggly! Thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee. 
Ford WRITHES in pain, as does Arthur but less so.

GUIDE VOICE Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe. 
Ford VIBRATES like he's having an epileptic seizure. Arthur just looks like he has a migraine. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. 
Spasms wrack Ford's body.    He SCREAMS.     Arthur squints. 
JELTZ Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don't! 
Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp. Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends. 
GUIDE VOICE The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix. It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was. 
JELTZ So, Earthlings, I present you with a simple choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or -- tell what you thought of my poem. 
Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up. 
ARTHUR Actually...I rather liked it. 
Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur. 
FORD Good tact. Run with it. 
ARTHUR Um...some of the words I didn't understand, but I found the imagery quite effective.

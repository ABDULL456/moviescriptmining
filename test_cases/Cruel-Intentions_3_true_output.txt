KATHRYN You didn't? 
SEBASTIAN Oh yes. 
KATHRYN Tell me all the details. 
SEBASTIAN It was... Fantastic. 
KATHRYN Oh come on. For her first time? 
SEBASTIAN I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card. 
KATHRYN No, tell me. 
SEBASTIAN It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part. 
KATHRYN Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping. 
SEBASTIAN Mock, mock, mock. 
She places her hand on his crotch. 
KATHRYN So I assume you've come here to make some arrangements. 
Sebastian stands. 
SEBASTIAN Some other time. 
KATHRYN Excuse me? 
SEBASTIAN I'm not in the mood. 
KATHRYN And that's why you're leaving? 
SEBASTIAN It clearly is why. 
KATHRYN I want to fuck. 
SEBASTIAN And I don't. 
He leaves and slams the door behind him. 
79   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         79 
Sebastian talks on the phone. 
SEBASTIAN I'll pick you up in an hour. I love you too. 
He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway. 
KATHRYN Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped. 
SEBASTIAN No, I'm not. 
KATHRYN P-whipped, p-whipped. 
SEBASTIAN What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way? 
Kathryn starts to cry. 
KATHRYN I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore. 
SEBASTIAN Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest. 
KATHRYN At first it was, but now it's become something bigger. 
SEBASTIAN Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you. 
KATHRYN Not anymore you don't. It's obvious. 
SEBASTIAN I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet. 
KATHRYN Is that what you think? 
He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it aside, spreading her legs. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Alright, come on, let's get it over with. But mark my words, this is the only time it'll happen. 
She picks up the phone. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in me. While you're doing that I'm gonna make some phone calls.

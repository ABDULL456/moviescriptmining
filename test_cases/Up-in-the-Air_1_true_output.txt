RYAN Not really. No. 
The conversation stalls out. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - NIGHT 
Everyone is leaving. Tammy grabs Julie's hands. 
TAMMY Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How are you going to sleep? 
JULIE I don't know! 
TAMMY You want some Xanax? 
RYAN I don't think that's for sleeping. 
JULIE No, I'm good. I'll have some warm milk. That should do the trick. 
Jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding. 
JIM One more box... 
ALEX I'll get it. 
RYAN You sure? 
ALEX Yeah, yeah... 
Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together. 
RYAN Jim seems like a good guy. 
JULIE Yeah, I know... Isn't he great? 
KARA He's going to make a great husband. 
There's a moment where they just look at each other and giggle a little. Just the three of them. 
RYAN Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with dad not being... Well, I didn't know if you had someone to walk you down the aisle... 
JULIE Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to do it. 
KARA (UNCOMFORTABLE) He's been really supportive. 
RYAN Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to make sure you were covered. So I should get there at... 
JULIE Guests are arriving around 5ish. Things get going at 530. So you know, around then. It's easy. Just come down the elevator. 
Alex comes out with the second box. Ryan notices and grabs the flowers from her and sets them in Jim's luxury pick-up truck. 
INT. CORRIDOR, CHALET SUITES - NIGHT 
Ryan, Alex, and Kara arrive at their adjacent rooms. Key cards slide in simultaneously. Alex heads in. Ryan stops. 
RYAN Hey Kara? 
KARA Yeah. 
RYAN Can you believe she's getting married already? She's just a kid. 
KARA No Ryan. Actually, she's 37 years old. She's barely squeaking by. 
RYAN Oh. 
KARA Yup. Sleep tight. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. RYAN'S OLD HIGH SCHOOL - NEXT MORNING 
The rental car pulls up into the empty lot. Snow on the ground. It's cold. 
Ryan and Alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main building - it's locked. Ryan shrugs. 
ALEX That's all you got? 
Alex starts walking down the side of the building, looking for an open window. The third one opens a crack. She slides her HOTEL HONORS CARD in and opens the latch. 
RYAN Are we really doing this? 
ALEX Give me a boost. 
INT. CLASSROOM, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

LILA Ugnh. 
PUFF Ugnh. 
NATHAN Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject. 
PUFF Unn. 
NATHAN Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur. 
Nathan laughs heartily, haughtily, at his joke as Lila and Puff climb down from the tree. 
NATHAN Look at you two. You both disgust me. 
LILA Oook. Oook. 
NATHAN Shut up! (to Puff) I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit. 
LILA Ooka. 
NATHAN Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore. (to Puff) C'mon, monkey boy. 
Puff looks at Lila. Lila shrugs helplessly. Puff reaches out to touch her hand. 
NATHAN Now! 
Puff looks at Lila again. She jerks her head in the direction of Nathan. Puff sighs and moves to Nathan. 
Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees. 
Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over. 
Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground. 
Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up. Nathan stands also, backing away. Puff has the gun trained on Nathan. Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him. 
NATHAN Puff, put the gun down. 
PUFF Ounpoo. Ungh. 
NATHAN Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we? 
PUFF (jumping up and down like a chimp) Unka unka unka unka unka. 
NATHAN Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again. 
PUFF (to Lila, guiltily) I have to talk. Is that okay? 
Lila nods. 
PUFF (to Nathan) You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you. 
NATHAN No. 
LILA Puff, don't. 
Puff shoots. A crow screams. The fluttering of wings. The bullet hits Nathan in the head. He falls. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Lila sobs. 
LILA Then I shot Nathan. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Puff dabs his eye. 
PUFF Then Lila shot Nathan.

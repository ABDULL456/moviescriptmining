Footsteps across the porch. The two girls look toward the door. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 
SHOOTING PAST Mary. The door slowly opens. Wyatt enters. He crosses to the bedroom door, CAMERA PANNING WITH him. It is as though he doesn't see the two women. He stands in front of the door, staring at it. Then his hand moves to the knob. Slowly he turns the knob and opens the door. The two girls watch him as he hesitates on the threshold. Then he enters and closes the door softly. Helen looks over at Mary and smiles. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MED. SHOT as Wyatt stops, looking at Elaine, resting back against the pillow, seeming very young in the nightgown. For a moment it is difficult to know what is in Wyatt's mind. Then he sees the twin tintypes. CAMERA MOVES TOWARD Wyatt's face as tears come to his eyes. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
MED. SHOT as footsteps cross the porch and the screen door creaks open. Clay enters the kitchen, carrying the girls' suitcases and some blankets. He nods to the girls, then goes to the door leading to the other bedroom. There he stops. 
CLAY This will be your room until Mr. Wyatt finds time to take you to the nearest stage station. 
As he carries their belongings in: 
DISSOLVE OUT 
INT. MARY'S AND HELEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT DISSOLVE IN 
The room is lighted only by the moonlight. Mary and Helen are in the big four poster bed, close to the window. Clay's footsteps are heard on the porch. The kitchen door closes softly. There is the rattle of a stove lid being lifted. 
HELEN (whispering) That sounds like him. 
Mary slides out of bed and slips into a robe. 
HELEN This time don't talk about cooking! 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Clay turns from the stove to the cupboard over the sink and takes down a coffee cup. The door into Elaine's bedroom is closed. The door into Mary's bedroom opens and Mary enters the kitchen. He turns back to the stove and fills his cup as Mary comes up. 
CLAY Coffee? 
MARY No, thanks. (indicating Elaine's bedroom) I hope we won't be a burden to them. 
CLAY I hope so, too. 
He picks up his coffee and goes out on the porch. Mary hesitates, then follows. 
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT 
ANGLED PAST Clay. Mary comes out. Clay sits on the bench by the door, drinking his coffee. 
CLAY (quiet) If you're figuring on asking me to take you, it's no use. 
Mary crosses to stand above him. 
MARY A time like this people ought to be alone. Having us around is going to make it sort of hard on 'em. 
Mary sighs, sits beside him. From the pocket of her robe she takes tobacco, rolls a cigarette and lights it. She passes the tobacco to Clay. He rolls one. 
CLAY (on the defensive) I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be. 
MARY I suppose it is. 
CLAY And it's not only because the trip's a tough one -- 
Mary strikes a match and holds the flame to his cigarette. 
MARY (softly) You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done? 
CLAY I couldn't leave you sitting by the road. 
MARY You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel. 
Mary rises to move to the edge of the porch. 
MED. CLOSE 
Mary in f.g. 
MARY (softly) No man who brings up a kid like you've brought up Steve could ever be cruel to people. 
Turning, she leans against the post that supports the porch. 
MARY I hope you get everything you want out of life -- 
CLAY (wary) Thanks. 
MARY You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham. 
CLAY The who? 
MARY You should know. She's in your dream. 
Clay puts his cup down, looks up. She is very lovely standing in the moonlight, her body arched back, the robe open a little. 
MARY Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. (she pauses) 
CLAY (enigmatic) Go on. Tell me more about her. 
MARY She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples. 
CLAY (dryly) I'll make the soap myself. 
MARY But the rest is right. 
CLAY Will she be dark or fair? 
MARY Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.

CLEMENTINE I'm so excited.  Yay! 
PATRICK I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to give you this.  It's a little... thing. 
Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) I didn't have a chance to wrap it. 
CLEMENTINE It's gorgeous. (slipping it on) Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. (kisses him) Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed. 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front. 
CLEMENTINE Such a beautiful view. 
JOEL (looking at her) Yes indeed. (snapping out of memory) Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem! 
CLEMENTINE Oh? 
JOEL I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore. 
CLEMENTINE Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake? 
JOEL I don't know. 
He concentrates.  Nothing happens. 
JOEL (CONT'D) Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped! 
He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory and Clementine are fading around him. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
It's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her underwear.  She's reading, too. 
VOICE-OVER She's so sexy. 
JOEL I loved you on this day.  I love this memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging. 
Clementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in thought. 
CLEMENTINE What if you hide me? 
JOEL What do you mean? 
CLEMENTINE (formulating) Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? (proud) And we can hide there till morning. 
Joel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades. 
JOEL Where?  Where?  Where? 
He drags her through the landscape of already decayed memories and turns off into: 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
The kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth preparing dinner. 
CLEMENTINE Jesus.  What's this? 
Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman. 
JOEL I must be about two. (oddly) I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not looking at me. (back to himself, re: doll) Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told you about this! (beat) I want my mommy! 
He starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs him. 
JOEL (CONT'D) (crying still) I want my mommy. (adult, to Clementine) I don't want to lose you, Clem. 
CLEMENTINE I'm right here. 
JOEL I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you.  I don't want to lose... 
CLEMENTINE Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory.  I think we're hidden. 
Joel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles. 
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor. 
STAN It's stopped. 
MARY What?

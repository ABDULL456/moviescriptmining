INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY 
Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. 
KYLO REN The droid... stole a freighter? 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing scars. 
KYLO REN Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but: 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove: 
KYLO REN What girl? 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY 
Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES. 
REY It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues -- 
FINN How bad is it?! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS: 
FINN They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench. 
REY BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! 
FINN (Throws a tool) This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently: 
FINN (CONT'D) You gotta tell us where the base is. 
(BB-8 BEEPS) I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. Rey pops up again: 
REY Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool. 
REY (CONT'D) So where's your base? 
FINN (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. 
(QUIETLY) Please! She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole situation, then BEEPS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again. 
FINN Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it. 
REY I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! 
FINN (searching for tape) What about you? 
REY I gotta get back to Jakku! 
FINN (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! 
REY No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below: 
FINN This? 
REY Yes! 
FINN Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed: 
REY None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.

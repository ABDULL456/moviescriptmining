PATRICK Shoot it. 
MARTHA They're living animals. 
PATRICK So, shoot Max then. 
Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at Max. Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Go on! 
Max is confused, he gets embarrassed. 
MAX Fuck this. 
PATRICK Don't walk away from me Max. 
Max stops. Martha drops the gun down to her waist. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) The cat has terminal cancer, it's in excruciating pain. 
MARTHA I can't. 
PATRICK Max has no substance, he's just here to free load and be around the girls but you're a teacher and leader, you just don't see it because no one let you believe it before me. You're a leader a Marcy, now prove it. 
Martha is shook up. She does not fire the gun. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love. You're holding on to some false emotion that stops you from doing what's right. 
Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand. The gun goes off. Martha and Max jump. Zoe shot the cat without blinking. She hands the gun back to Martha. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) I could spend my life being selfish, living alone, using this gift for me but I've sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be. You need to trust me. 
MARTHA I trust you. 
PATRICK Then you shouldn't need me to explain everything. 
A gun shot goes off. They all look up. Max looks mortified, he has shot the other cat. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) What did you do? 
MAX You said it was sick. 
PATRICK One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one it was! 
Max tosses the gun and walks away. 
INT. FARM HAY LOFT - NIGHT 
Martha looks for Max. She finds him in the hay loft. 
MARTHA You okay? 
MAX I'm fine. (BEAT) I'll probably leave this place soon anyways. 
MARTHA Where are you going to go? 
MAX I got places. My cousin lives in Bennington, he said I could go up there and make like, $500 a week selling weed. 
MARTHA You don't want to do that. 
MAX I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all these rules.

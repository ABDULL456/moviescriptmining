ZEKE Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been? 
NONA Happy.  And he won't want to see you. 
Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside. 
INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Quincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up by pillows.  He stares out the window. 
ZEKE Hey, son. 
Quincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window. 
ZEKE (cont'd) Well, you made SportsCenter. 
QUINCY What do you want? 
ZEKE Came by to check on you. 
QUINCY After five years. 
ZEKE Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. 
QUINCY Look, I'm busy. 
ZEKE I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself. 
QUINCY I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget? 
ZEKE No. 
QUINCY Good. 
ZEKE Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me. 
QUINCY And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?" 
ZEKE You want me to fuck off? 
QUINCY Yeah. 
ZEKE Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something. 
Silence.  Then. 
ZEKE (cont'd) You're a better ballplayer than I ever was.  But you got a lot of other things going for you.  You're smart.  I always felt...I always knew that you could do anything you wanted.  You want to be a ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know you ain't like everybody else on that court.  You ain't like I was.  You got options.  That's all I ever tried to show you. 
QUINCY You're still trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me? 
Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an answer. 
ZEKE I just couldn't 
With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes. 
DISSOLVE TO: INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
A NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves 
past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing 
with flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the room.  She crosses back out. 
A toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his gown. 
VOICE (O.S.) And I thought this was gonna be awkward. 
Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her appearance. 
QUINCY Monica? 
He stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm before he falls. 
MONICA I'm sorry. 
Quincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five years.  An awkward beat. 
MONICA (cont'd) So, how you doing? 
QUINCY Alright.  I heard you were in Spain. 
MONICA I was. (smiling) I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. 
Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously. 
QUINCY Just something I'm trying. 
MONICA No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool. 
QUINCY Thanks. 
Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain.

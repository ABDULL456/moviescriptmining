BOYD Call the police. Okay, that's one option. 
ADAM That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here. 
BOYD Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options. 
ON Fisher and Moore. 
MOORE I've never seen a dead person. 
As Moore moves in, transfixed, to take a closer look... 
FISHER (enraged) Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys! 
BOYD Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police... What happens? (silence) They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom... They ask us... What happened? We say, ah... our friend, Michael... (to Adam) Your brother... got a little out of control... they were making love... and he got a little excited... and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose... 
ADAM Stop it! 
BOYD There's more. 
ADAM Just stop. 
BOYD Just giving the facts. 
ADAM I'm calling the police. 
BOYD What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well... we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days... Beautiful wife... he didn't have anything at all to do with it... It was all Michael here... just Michael... 
ADAM You don't play games with Homicide police. There are no options here. There is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle. 
BOYD I've known him for while maybe twenty years kind of a close friend but hey what the heck officer, take him away, go on it's for his own good. 
FISHER (outraged) What are you talking about? Adam's right. We don't have a choice here Boyd... I mean what are you talking about? What options??? 
BOYD (calm) Bury her out in the desert. 
ADAM (sarcastic) Sure, why not. 
MOORE He's right. 
BOYD We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place... and put her in the ground. 
ADAM You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman. 
BOYD We can do this. We can get her out of here. 
ADAM Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone? 
BOYD Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows. 
FISHER Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here. 
BOYD Nobody knows. 
PAUSE, as the guys digest this point. 
ADAM Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem. 
BOYD It's a marble floor, we can clean it up. 
FISHER Oh God. This is insane. 
BOYD What's insane is the fact that Michael here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane. 
MOORE They'll get us on accessory to murder. 
ADAM Bullshit it's not accessory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident... 
BOYD Her fucking head was caved in. 
ADAM So! I didn't fucking do it! 
BOYD She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Michael goes down, we all go down. 
MOORE I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore. 
ADAM That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person! 
FISHER (falling away) I'm getting married... 
MICHAEL I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

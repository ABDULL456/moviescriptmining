Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and gestures for her to wait a minute. 
But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes. She backs to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear. 
EDWARD (to the Administrator) I'll just... endure it. 
He strides out the door. Off Bella.. 
19 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 19 
Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches 
20 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) 20 
-- and closes the door. Her eyes well... but she fights it, getting mad. 
BELLA Jerk. 
As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH 
SMASH TO: 
21 ECU ON A SECURITY GUARD - IN THE DARKNESS 21 
Extremely tight on his terrified FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound. INCLUDE 
22 INT. GRISHAM MILL - LATE AFTERNOON 22 
--He's crouched in a dark corner. But then he sees a SHADOW move blindingly fast past him. He jerks around, then another SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He BOLTS! 
He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of the mill striating him. He moves as fast as humanly possible 
UNKNOWN POV - ON THE SECURITY GUARD FROM SEVERAL FLOORS BELOW 
UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to 
THE SECURITY GUARD 
-- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his shoulder with terror. UNKNOWN POV is closing in on him, but then he BOLTS out a door 
23 EXT. GRISHAM MILL (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON 23 
-- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching over the side, into the air 
-- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing. A HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING.. 
24 INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON 24 
ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie. He shares a table with Bella. INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 30's. She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her. 
Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie's oblivious. 
CORA 
Can't get over how grown up you 
are. And so gorgeous. 
Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak. A bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella 
WAYLON Â‘Member me, honey? I was Santa one year. 
CHARLIE Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four. 
WAYLON Bet I made an impression, though. 
CHARLIE You always do. 
CORA Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. 
(to Bella) When you're done, I'll bring your favorite - berry cobbler. Remember? Your dad still has it. Every Thursday. 
BELLA (doesn't remember at all) That'd be great, thank you. 
Cora shoos Waylon away. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella both reach for the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes for the ketchup instead. Silence as they eat. 
A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to emphasize their discomfort. Bella tries to bridge the gap. 
BELLA So... you eat here every night? 
CHARLIE Easier than washing dishes. 
BELLA I can cook. 
He looks up, as if confused by the concept. 
BELLA I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen. 
CHARLIE I remember..

MEDIA MAN 2 Look at him. He doesn't have a care in the world. He's gonna walk. 
INT.  FOYER TO COURTROOM  DAY 
The MacManusus stand in the foyer. There are a pair of doors that go to the outside hallway and a pair that go to the inside courtroom. There is an armed guard directly inside the courtroom, in front of the doors. 
The door opens a crack and Connor waves the guard into the foyer and starts talking to him. Then dad zaps him with a stun gun. The guard is on the floor, incapacitated and drooling as the boys handcuff him. 
Connor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the door handles that lead from the hall into the foyer. He locks them in with a padlock. 
FATHER How long do these put a man down for? 
MURPHY Ten minutes. 
The father zaps the incapacitated man a second time as he lay. 
FATHER Twenty is a bit better. 
They suit up, Connor and Murphy in their usual masks and gloves, Dad is already in his usual dark hat and glasses. 
The boys start for the courtroom door but dad gently holds them back. He takes a moment, then slowly removes his hat and glasses. His sons look at one another and then remove their masks. The three look into each others eyes for a moment. 
INT.  COURTROOM  DAY 
JUDGE Due to the lack of hard evidence...... 
The three burst in, guns drawn, and are walking down the aisle. 
FATHER All media to the back! Drop the cameras! Drop 'em! 
Terrified, they all obey. Connor and Murphy pull Yakavetta from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees just before the judge's bench. They face him toward the occupants of the courtroom. The father walks up and motions for the judge, who is now banging his gavel and shouting in protest, to come off the stand. 
As soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the media stands in horror. He turns and walks back down the aisle. 
FATHER (loudly) You people have been chosen to reveal our existence to the world. You will witness what happens here today and you will tell of it afterwards. 
All eyes to the front. 
YAKAVETTA (looking to his comrades) Fuckin' do something! 
The father keeps them covered. He passes the front, he looks and sees a VIRGINAL-LOOKING WOMAN with her head down crying into her hands. She is on the left side. He gently tilts her chin forward, her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on the back of his hand. 
FATHER (WHISPERS) (whispers) You must watch dear. It'll all be over soon. (she obeys) 
The father takes out a flask. He pours the booze on the judges bench and set it ablaze. Fire alarms start to sound. 
Connor and Murphy jump up on the lawyers' tables. Murphy on the prosecution side, Connor on the defense. The father has his sawed-off to the back of Yakavetta's head. 
CONNOR (yelling over the alarm) Now, you will receive us. 
MURPHY (yelling over the alarm) We do not ask for your poor or your hungry. 
CONNOR We do not want your tired and sick. 
MURPHY It is your corrupt we claim. 
CONNOR It is your evil, who will be sought by us. 
MURPHY With every breath we shall hunt them down. 
CONNOR Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies. 
MURPHY Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace. 
CONNOR These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. (points to Yakavetta) 
MURPHY There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth (pointing to Yakavetta's people) Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain. 
CONNOR For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it. 
MURPHY And we will send you to whatever God you wish. 
Connor and Murphy jump off the table. They approach Yakavetta and stand on either side of their father. All three men hold guns to his head and recite the prayer. As they speak, the right side of the courtroom screams in protest. The left watches in wide-eyed terror, although some men encourage them to do it. The MacManus' read the prayer. They do not falter as the flames rage behind them.

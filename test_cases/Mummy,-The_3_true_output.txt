EVELYN I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell. 
O'CONNELL No you're not. 
EVELYN I'm not? 
O'CONNELL Not unless you call me Rick. 
EVELYN Why would I do that? 
O'CONNELL Because that's my name. 
She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and just smiles. 
INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY 
Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS. 
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover. 
They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus. 
PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch. 
EVELYN I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk. 
JONATHAN Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there. 
EVELYN Well neither do I, thank you. 
O'Connell gives her a hurt look. 
O'CONNELL You don't? 
Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look. 
EVELYN No... Why?... Should I? 
O'CONNELL Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had. 
O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly grab their sore heads and MOAN. 
INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY 
Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them. 
Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor. 
Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics. 
EGYPTOLOGIST There is a curse upon this chest. 
DANIELS Curse my ass. 
HENDERSON Yeah, who cares. 
The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye 
EGYPTOLOGIST In these hallowed grounds, that which was set forth in ancient times, is as strong today, as it was then. 
HENDERSON Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it -- 
The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription: 
EGYPTOLOGIST "Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest". 
A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING. 
The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous. 
EGYPTOLOGIST It says, there is one, the undead, who if brought back to life, is bound by sacred law to consummate this curse. 
HENDERSON Yeah, well, let's just make sure we don't bring anybody back from the dead then, huh? 
The three Americans laugh. 
EGYPTOLOGIST He will kill all who open this chest,... and assimilate their organs and fluids. 
DANIELS Assimilate their organs and fluids? Ya mean eat 'em? 
EGYPTOLOGIST And in so doing he will regenerate. And no longer be the undead, but a plague upon this earth. 
The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just shrugs. 
HENDERSON Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

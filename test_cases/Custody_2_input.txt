INT. SUMMIT COUNTY JAIL - CELL 
Rick sits alone, his head hung low. A JAILER, (40's) approaches leading THREE YOUNG CHILDREN to the cell. KRIS, (8), is followed by PHILLIP, (6), and NICHOLAS, (4). The door swings open. The children run to their father. 
KRIS Daddy! 
RICK Hi guys. 
PHILLIP I love you daddy. 
RICK I love you too, Phillip. 
NICHOLAS I love you more. 
RICK I love you more. 
NICHOLAS I love YOU more. 
KRIS Daddy, how come you're in jail? 
PHILLIP Is this where we live? 
KRIS When can we see mommy? 
RICK Come here guys. I want to talk to you. The boys gather round. 
PHILLIP What's wrong Daddy? 
RICK I don't know when we're going to see your mom again. KRIS Is she okay? 
RICK She's kind of mad at daddy. 
NICHOLAS Mommy mad at me too? 
RICK No, baby, not at all. Your mom needs time to work through some things. So, for awhile, it's just going to be us... 
KRIS What's she need time for? 
RICK To figure out who she is, where she's going, what she wants. 
NICHOLAS I miss mommy. 
RICK She misses you too, baby. And this isn't permanent... we're going to fight this... we're going to appeal. We'll take it to the Supreme Court if we have to. KRIS You don't want us either? 
RICK Of course I want you. I just don't think I should have to do this alone. 
The jailer still lingers in the doorway, leaning against the bars. 
JAILER I feel for you, I really do, but I've seen your kind before. You're a lifer. Whether it's fair or not. Whether justice was served. It doesn't matter. You're here for the duration. 
The boys cling to their father. The CLANK of the door being closed. The Jailer WHISTLES a sad spiritual as he walks away. CUT TO: 
INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Melanie sits on her couch and cries. Zach ENTERS. 
ZACH What's wrong mommy? 
MELANIE Nothing. 
ZACH Why are you crying? Did I do something wrong? 
MELANIE Nothing at all baby. 
ZACH (Pulling a book from an end table) Tell me a story? 
The camera pulls back to reveal that the room is really a well furnished cell. 
MELANIE Once upon a time, a very long time ago...

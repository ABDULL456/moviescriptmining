MILO You know he's never been anybody's counselor before? 
ALICE Milo! What about --? 
She gestures at what she hopes will be their home. 
MILO Oh, It's great. It's great! (they start to kiss, but:) 'Think I should tell him I learned everything using 1.0? Maybe I could show him one of my early programs. 
She pulls him back into the kiss. 
MONTAGE W/ MUSIC 
1.) MILO types intently in his office. 
2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks. 
3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book. 
4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled on it. Gary seems touched. 
INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is reading from a document: 
DOJ AGENT "Infotek's urgent need to license Outpost Office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation." (looks up) When you wrote the word "tool," what'd you mean by it? 
Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed. 
GARY I don't remember. 
DOJ AGENT What d'you think you meant by it? 
GARY I'm confused. Am I supposed to speculate under oath? 
The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, while offering nothing). 
OTHER AGENT Since you didn't have an answer to that question, Mr. Boyd -- 
GARY ("confused" again) Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't remember." 
The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to hide his annoyance: 
DOJ AGENT Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd? 
INT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER 
Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it. 
PHIL Your protege's moving so fast we can barely keep up with him. 
Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code. 
GARY This is good. Who did it? 
PHIL 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. 
GARY Maybe we should all get on it. 
INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters. 
GARY How's it going? 
MILO Maybe I'm going too fast. 
GARY (sharply; incredulous) Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they -- 
Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales. 
GARY Even when I had a hand in every aspect of the company I knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process. 
Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more engrossing than Skywire?) 
MILO It's okay. Really. 
GARY (reaching into his pocket) Take a look at this. Slightly different approach. 
Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow. 
MILO You did this -- overnight? 
GARY You're making me young again. 
INT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
PAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled, smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway. 
NEWS VOICE ...A graduate of MIT, he was on the antidepressant Prozac, and had been warned not to drink and drive. (Etc.) 
Lisa watches the news report, knowingly. 
INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - DAY

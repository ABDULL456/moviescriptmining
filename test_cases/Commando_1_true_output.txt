Cindy and Matrix continue in the Sunbeam, keeping a distance between themselves and Sully.

EXT. GALLERIA - DUSK 97 
As dusk approaches, Sully drives his Porsche into the Galleria. Cindy pulls her Sunbeam in two cars behind him. 
INT. GALLERIA PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 98 
Sully parks his car, gets out carrying a briefcase, goes to the glass elevator, stares at TWO PRETTY VALLEY GIRLS, takes his dark glasses off and joins them in the elevator. 
MATRIX AND CINDY 99 Matrix and Cindy are sitting in her car watching Sully. As soon as the elevator disappears, Matrix grabs Cindy's keys from the ignition and takes her arm.

CINDY If you're in a hurry, don't let me hold you up... The elevator returns and they get in. 
INT. GALLERIA - NIGHT 100 
The Galleria interiors runs around the perimeter of a three-story open vaulted area. In addition to the glass elevator, several tiered steps and banks of escalators run up and down the levels. Lots of decorative banners in hot colors decorate the open area. The top level is particularly active... restaurants, bars, video parlor, movie theatre. It's the hub of valley nightlife, lots of shoppers and kids just hanging out. Matrix and Cindy exit from the elevator onto the top level next to the wide-open vaulted space. Matrix immediately searches with his eyes for Sully. She takes a quick step to get away, but Matrix immediately GRABS her arm and PULLS her back toward him so they are now nose to nose. He motions to the other side of the top level and we SEE Sully walking. 
MATRIX X (whispered, anxious) My daughter's been kidnapped and he's my only chance of finding her! If he sees me or I lose him, they'll kill her. I need you to follow him; if I get too close, he'll run. Cindy looks back at Matrix in shock. 
MATRIX (pleading, desperate) Please help me, you're my only X chance! She's got less than ten hours left. Cindy doesn't know what to say. Matrix, still holding her arm, SHAKES her in desperation. Cont.

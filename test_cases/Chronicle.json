{"test1_input": "The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room. Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working. \nANDREW I'm uploading what I shot today...you have to keep a back-up, you know. \nThe door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s, Andrew's father. He doesn't look as white trash as you'd expect. \nAndrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working. Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair. \nMR. DETMER When I say open this door, you open this fucking door. \nMr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out.   Andrew sits on the floor in silence. \nEXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - NIGHT \nWe're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old fence and rusted out farm equipment. \nANDREW (O.S.) Are you sure it's here? (beat) Are you sure it's here, this all looks closed- \nMATT It's here, calm down.    Listen. \nWe can faintly hear party music. \nANDREW (O.S.) Oh yeah. \nEXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN \nCars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and Andrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and there's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around. \nMATT Hey dude, don't follow me around all night. \nANDREW (O.S.) What? \nMATT Don't follow me around all night, okay? \nANDREW (O.S.) What am I supposed to do? I thought you said you didn't want to go alone- \nMATT Talk to people?   Have a beer, I don't know. \nMONTAGED FOOTAGE... \nAndrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking, girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16, filming as well. They shout over the music. \nCASEY Hey, what are you filming for? \nANDREW (O.S.) Oh, I don't- just filming. \nCASEY What?   I'm filming for my blog! \nANDREW (O.S.) What? \nCASEY I have a video blog!   Why are you filming? \nAndrew simply backs away. More footage of the party. AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.   He's clearly a little drunk. \nAUSTIN Hey, were you filming my girlfriend? Yes or no, were you filming my girlfriend? \nANDREW (O.S.) No, I wasn't filming anyone specific, just filming the party. \nAUSTIN (beat) Okay, good, because I don't wanna have to beat your ass. \nANDREW (O.S.) Okay. \n", "test1_true": "ANDREW (O.S.) Okay- \nAUSTIN Cause I know you were filming my girlfriend dancing. I should break your fucking nose, you know that? You know that, I should beat your ass right now, but I'm trying to be nice. Fuck you. \nAustin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on the camera, and then spits on him. Andrew backs up, shocked, lowering the camera. \nEXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS \nAndrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the lens of the camera, obstructing our view. Cut to a few moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the ground. We can see the barn, the party still going on. \nAfter a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying. \nSTEVE (O.S.) (loud, sudden) Are you Andrew? \nANDREW (O.S.) (startled) What- STEVE Are you Andrew-with-the-camera? (beat) Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a camera? \nThe camera is picked up to reveal STEVE \"Kaz\" Kazinksy, 17, approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing, instantly likeable charisma. \nHe's a little drunk and giddy. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Dude, are you okay? \nANDREW (O.S.) I'm Andrew. \nSTEVE I'm Steve Kazinsky- \nANDREW (O.S.) No, I know. \nSTEVE ...yeah? \nANDREW (O.S.) Everybody knows who you are. \nSTEVE Haha, yes, that is true. Listen, come on, bring the camera. \nANDREW (O.S.) What?   I don't- \nSTEVE Come on. \nSteve starts off, but Andrew hesitates. \nANDREW (O.S.) I don't- \nSTEVE Dude, come on, we found something. \nEXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - FIELD \nSteve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward woods. It's rather dark. ANDREW (O.S.) Look, I don't think we're supposed to- \nSTEVE Is there a light on that?   On your camera? \nANDREW (O.S.) Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know- \nThe camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with it. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve. \nSTEVE Awesome. \nCUT. \nThey've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly. \n", "test1_id": 2646, "test2_input": "Neither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the distance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible. \nANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D) What?   I can't hear you! \nSteve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging. \nA BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE.    He's spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock. Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead. The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in some tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting apart. \nThey lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing; his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up. \nSTEVE WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED! \nSteve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) You saved   my life, dude! Andrew, you saved   my fucking life! Is that- Holy shit   is that the camera?! You AND THE CAMERA!? caught me \nANDREW (exhausted) Y- yeah- \nSTEVE FUCKIN' AMAZING! \nMatt touches down behind them, frantic. \nMATT What happened, are you- \nSTEVE Ahhhhh! \nSteve joy-tackles Matt to the ground. \nMATT (laughing) What the hell, what the hell- \nAndrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera. \nCUT. \nThey're all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging out. \nSTEVE This is what people have wanted forever, since like caveman times! Do you understand, I mean do you- jesus christ, I can't even- Everything is fucking great! I CAN FLY! Matt, listen, just say it! \nMATT ...I can fly. \nSTEVE Shout it out man! \nMATT I CAN FLY. (realizes it feels good) I CAN FLY! \nMatt stands, shouting out at the field. \nMATT (CONT'D) I CAN FUCKING FLY! \nAndrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs. \nANDREW (O.S.) I CAN FLY! \nSTEVE FUCK.   YES. \nHOLD ON BLACK FOR A MOMENT. \nEXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT \nSteve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of Steve's house; empty beers are all around. All three are at least tipsy. \nMatt is up. \n", "test2_true": "ANDREW (O.S.) (flatly) No. \nAll three crack up. \nMATT That's cold, you're so cold! MY OWN COUSIN! DJ Steve, dial me up- Steve immediately starts beatboxing. \nMATT (CONT'D) Okay, yo, yeah, yo, you say you wanna get high you ain't high as me, you chillin' at yo mom's house I'm at four thousand feet, cauuuse I got those tight muscles, in my, braingina, and you better believe I'm a, frequent flyer, and you know I don't need no turbines, ladies fly first class on Garrety airlines, my DJ is senior class, president, straight outta Oregon, gotta, represent, Matt Garrety bitches, I'm the young Clark Kent. \nSteve and Andrew cheer and Matt takes a bow. \nCUT. \nThe guys have broken open glowsticks, and Steve is filming as Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at each other; it's beautiful. \nCUT. \nWe cut between three sing alongs; \"Shake That\" by Nate Dogg and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesn't know the lyrics), \"How You Remind Me\" by Nickelback, and \"Macho Man\" by The Village People. \nINT. STEVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe guys are in that sleepy mode, now. Andrew's filming, but not really focusing on anything. Matt's sprawled out on a couch opposite him. Steve's in a chair nearby. \nMATT But how does she not notice? \nSTEVE Well, I mean, she notices that it's gotten better, definitely. You just have to be subtle. \nANDREW (O.S.) That's so cool. Doesn't that count as breaking rule #1 though? \nSTEVE Pfff, technicalities. MATT Man, I haven't had sex since like...a year. \nANDREW (O.S.) I haven't had sex since ever. \nSTEVE Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so cool? \nMATT Liquid nitrogen. \nCUT. \nLater. Drowsier. Light's coming from the TV. The camera is laying haphazardly on Andrew. They're all nearly asleep, drowsy drunk. \nMATT (CONT'D) Hey guys, are you up? \nSTEVE Yeah. \nANDREW (O.S.) YO. \nMATT Today was like...the best day of my life. Like I was thinking and I can't think of any day I liked better than today. \nThere's a silence. \nANDREW (O.S.) Yeah. \nSTEVE Unanimous.     Yes. \nMATT Okay...good. \nBeat.   Silence. \nEXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - THE CLEARING - MORNING \n", "test2_id": 2647, "test3_input": "Time has passed; maybe two weeks. It's early. The hole is clearly caved in; the entire area is slumped downwards. \nSTEVE Well that answers that. \nANDREW (O.S.) I feel stupid now that I was scared to come back. \nMATT Nah man, we were all- I mean, I was, definitely, yeah. \nA POLICE OFFICER appears. \nPOLICE OFFICER Hey, you kids can't be here, okay? You gotta move on out. \nMATT What? \nPOLICE OFFICER The ground is unstable, we're cordoning the whole place off. \nINT. DINER - MORNING \nSteve is filming Andrew and Matt across the table. \nSTEVE (O.S.) I'm live on scene here with Matt and Andrew, boys, can you tell us what's happening? \nANDREW Well, uh, it would appear that a Virgin Mary has appeared in the maple syrup on a young local man's pancake. \nMATT In a second it will, wait... \nMatt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary. \nSTEVE (O.S.) That is, that is some very uh, definitely supernatural shit, going on there. \nCUT. \nMATT Well, when I was really little, I wanted to be police officer. \nSTEVE (O.S.) Oh, no shit? \nANDREW Fuck you, pig. \nMATT No, I just really got into on the idea of altruism, you know? \nANDREW What's that mean? \nMATT Like making things better for everyone. \nANDREW So what, you wanna do like, a charity? That's lame. \nSTEVE (O.S.) Why is that lame? \nANDREW I dunno. \nMATT I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't matter, you know. I'm never gonna get out of this piece of shit town. You know, we're all just little pieces. One person can't really make a difference. I used to think- I don't know. I don't know. \nMatt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the camera; it plinks off. \nSTEVE AAH!   DOUCHEBAG! \nCUT. \nNow Matt has the camera, filming Steve. \nMATT (O.S.) So what's it feel like to be good at everything? STEVE I'm not good at everything- \n", "test3_true": "STEVE I'm not GOOD at everything, I just do my best at everything. That's what it's about. I mean you talk about philosophy and shit all the time, but you never really do anything. Have you even applied to colleges yet? \nMATT I'll get to it- \nSTEVE You could use some of that, man, I'm just saying. \nMATT (O.S.) Oh yeah? Well you could use some shut the fuck up. \nSTEVE You lack initiative. \nMATT You lack...a dick. \nEXT. ROAD - LATER \nThe guys are walking along. Andrew's holding the camera loosely, not really caring, they're chatting, it's chill. Matt gets a text. \nMATT Shit man, I got my mom's birthday, I gotta go. \nANDREW Say hi for me. \nSTEVE Later dude. \nMatt turns and casually rockets off into the sky. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) What're you doing, where are you going now? ANDREW Well I don't wanna go home yet. You wanna go into the city? \nSTEVE Ah, dude, it's rush hour. \nANDREW So? \nThere's a beat, and then Steve laughs. \nSTEVE Hell yeah, dude. \nEXT. PORTLAND - THE ROOF OF THE KOIN CENTER - SUNSET \nThey're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes.   It's fucking awesome. The city is beautiful. \nSTEVE I wish I could bring Samantha up here. She'd love this. \nANDREW (O.S.) You still haven't told her? \nSTEVE Nah, no way. She'd freak out. \nCUT. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) Mom's like, never home anymore. I mean, you saw how my dad is, he's just quiet. Sits around. I don't know. And talking to him about it is just pointless. He's got nothing to say. \nCUT. \nANDREW (O.S.) And it's bad, because her pain gets real bad, you know, and we can't afford the good meds anymore. When I was little it wasn't as bad, but even then dad was still, you know, the way he is. I don't know. I don't know anymore. I don't know how to feel. CUT. \nSTEVE It'll be fine, dude.    You'll figure it out. \nANDREW (O.S.) I hope so. \nSTEVE Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter break's coming up...You wanna do the talent show with me? Get you out there, you know, meet some new people. \nANDREW (O.S.) No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm really shy, and I don't have any talents, or- \n", "test3_id": 2648}

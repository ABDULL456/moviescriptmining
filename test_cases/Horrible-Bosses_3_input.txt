KURT GAMBLE, 30s, good-looking, sits at his desk. Unlike Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace. A reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, UPS GIRL approaches his desk with a package. 
UPS GIRL Excuse me? Can you sign for this, please? 
KURT (TAKING IT) Sure. (LOOKING UP) Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What is this? 
UPS GIRL I'm sorry? 
KURT This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it? 
UPS GIRL What do you mean? 
KURT Come on. You're way too good- looking to be a UPS girl. What are you, a model? An actress? What's gonna happen when I open this box? Is something going to jump out at me? 
(CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 
UPS GIRL (GRINNING) Nothing's gonna happen. I'm just a UPS girl. 
KURT Shut up. 
UPS GIRL (PLAYFULLY) You shut up. It's true. 
KURT Well, then, I need to take you out to dinner. 
UPS GIRL Why? 
KURT Because I want to be able to tell my friends that I took out the hottest UPS girl in America. Come on, what do you say? 
She considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on a Post-it note. 
KURT Awesome. I'm Kurt. 
UPS GIRL Myrna. 
KURT Pretty name. How's Tuesday? Macaroni Grill? 
UPS GIRL Okay. 
KURT See you then, Myrna. 
She heads off. Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles "UPS Girl" in the Tuesday slot. We see every night of the week is filled with appointments with other women: "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren? Laura?," "Blonde Chick" and so on. 
JACK (O.S.) Busy week? 
Kurt looks up at JACK PELLIT, 70s, the kindly, affectionate owner of the company. (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (2) 24 
KURT Hey, Jack. Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America. 
JACK (CHUCKLING) You're what we used to call a rapscallion. 
KURT That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict.' 
JACK Walk with me, Kurt. 
The two of them head toward the exit. 
JACK I wanted to talk to you about -- 
KURT Last quarter's profits? I ran the numbers. We're down by 11 percent year-to-year. 
JACK It's this damn recession. What about cost-cutting measures? 
KURT Well, I know you don't want to cut STAFF -- 
JACK No way. These people have worked their asses off for me. There's no reason they should suffer. 
Kurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of love between these two. 
KURT There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal. We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer. 
JACK You know why it's good? Because they'll dump our chemicals in rivers, pollute water supplies and hurt people. I've spent my life building this company. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (3) 24 JACK (CONT'D) Would you want the Pellit name to be associated with something like that? 
KURT No, I wouldn't. 
As they pass the unisex rest room, they see MARGIE, 30s and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits to get in. 
JACK Everything okay, Margie? 
MARGIE Oh hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt. I've just been waiting to get in there for a while now... 
JACK Who's in there? 
MARGIE It's... your son. 
JACK (SIGHS) Of course it is. (then, knocking on THE DOOR) Bobby? There's someone waiting. You almost done in there?

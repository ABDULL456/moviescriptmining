PALMER Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy wrestle something into his car, follows him; he dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay. 
GARDNER CHUBB Well----what'd he do that for? 
PALMER Don't know sir. 
GARDNER CHUBB Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the body out? 
PALMER Mm-hm. 
GARDNER CHUBB Russian?   American? 
PALMER Don't know. Scrubbed of ID. 
GARDNER CHUBB And this... Linda...? 
PALMER Linda Litzke. 
GARDNER CHUBB She's Treasury? 
PALMER No, we're----um... fuzzy on her. 
Gardner Chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of the folder. 
GARDNER CHUBB Well----so----we don't really know what anyone is after. 
PALMER Not really, sir. 
GARDNER CHUBB This analyst, ex-analyst, uh... 
PALMER Cox. 
GARDNER CHUBB Yeah.    What's his clearance level. 
PALMER Three. 
GARDNER CHUBB Okay.    Okay, no biggie... 
He reaches the folder back to Palmer. 
GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D) ... for now just keep an eye on everyone, see what they do. 
PALMER Right, sir. And----we'll interface with the FBI on this, uh, dead body? 
GARDNER CHUBB No! No, we don't want those idiots blundering around in this. Burn the body. Get rid of it. And keep an eye on everyone, see what they do. Report back when, um, I don't know. When it makes sense. 
116   INT. YACHT CABIN - DAY                                        116 
A HOPPING MAN IN A UNITARD 
His hands are on his hips. He is darkly Mediterranean and very fit. He smiles into the camera as he hops in time to upbeat music, kicking a leg out on each beat. 
MAN To the left!... Repeat!... To the right!... Repeat!... And in!... And out!... And higher!... Repeat!... 
Wider shows that the man is on TV leading the viewer in exercise. The viewer, in this case, is Osbourne Cox, on his boat. 
He follows along in his underwear in the cramped quarters belowdecks. Boxes and luggage are strewn about, half- unpacked. 
He pants as he exercises: 
OSBOURNE I'm bigger... I'm back... I'm better... I'm back... than ever... I'm back... fuckers... I'm back... 
MAN ON TV ... And good!... Repeat!... Now bend!... And bounce!... . And lower!... Repeat!... And up!... And back!... And up!... Repeat! 
117   INT. TED'S OFFICE/LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY                          117 
LINDA 
We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles over, of Linda slumped at her desk, head in her arms. We faintly hear her sobbing. 
Reverse shows Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, looking at her, unsettled. 
CLOSE ON LINDA 
We are in her cubicle now, her weeping bumping up at the cut. 
A tap against the cubicle window brings her head up. 
Ted Treffon opens the door. 
TED Linda.   You okay? 
LINDA I'm fine, Ted, I'm sorry. 
He sits at the chair alongside her desk. 
TED You don't look fine. 
LINDA No no, I'm... I'm... 
TED You won't tell me what it's about. You never let me in, Linda. 
LINDA Oh, I know you're trustworthy, I just... don't want to endanger other people with----I mean, it's a path I've chosen, it's not, you have to isolate, you know, a firewall. 
Ted sighs. 
TED Uh-huh. Well, I don't know what to think. You both go AWOL on Friday; today Chad doesn't bother to come in at all----

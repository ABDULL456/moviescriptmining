JORDAN We need proof of life. 
PAUSE. 
VOICE Is the father, there? 
Jordan hands the phone to Samuel. 
SAMUEL Hello. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    72. 
VOICE If this girl's life  is as important to you as it is to me,  do not play with the process. Family is   everything. I am a professional. You   keep your word and I will keep mine. 
INT. DARKENED HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Creasy being wheeled down the hall by a tough plain- clothed Federal Policeman. Followed by Rayburn, Manzano, and Rosanna. The uniformed JUDICIAL POLICE are powerless to stop them. 
RAYBURN What's the deal here? 
ROSANNA I wouldn't gamble leaving him here. These guys will kill him in a heartbeat 'while trying to stop him from escaping.' 
EXT. TRUNKLESS CAR - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 
Samuel driving.   Tazinari dialing his cellphone. 
SAMUEL He said no phones! 
TAZINARI You do your job. I'll do mine. 
EXT.   BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - NIGHT 
Samuel's car is parked on the  south side of the bridge. A shirtless Samuel carries two  large duffle bags containing ten million dollars  across the bridge. We see Tazinari again dialing up his  cell phone. 
VOICE (V.O.) Leave the money in the trunk of the car with white paper taped to the windshield, then return to your car and go home. Do not look back. 
Samuel finds the car, leaves the bag in the trunk, he turns and heads back over the bridge. 
VOICE (V.O.) Remember, I am a professional. If you keep your word, I will keep mine. If you do not, then God be with your child. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     73. 
As Samuel is walking back across the bridge. Suddenly gunfire from where he came, along with shouting and yelling. Samuel crouches and runs in the dark back to his car with Tazinari. 
INT.   VETERINARIAN'S CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Cages of mangy looking mutts. Pull back to reveal Creasy on his hospital bed, IVs and all. 
Rayburn sits nearby. He looks up as Creasy stirs, wakes again. Creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the first question on his mind. Pinta... 
Rayburn looks away, can't face his friend.   And suddenly, Creasy knows. 
CREASY She's dead.   Isn't she? 
Rayburn finally nods. And with that gesture, God takes everything away. It might as well be the Old Testament. And we are about to get Biblical. 
Creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling. 
RAYBURN It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got killed. 
CU of Creasy's face with his back to the room.     A thousand yard stare. His eyes glaze over. 
FLASHBACK 
INT. CAR - MEXICO CITY 
CU of Pinta looking up at Creasy. The camera ramps into Pinta's smile. A small, but a sinificant moment in terms of their connection. 
INT. LISA & SAMUEL'S BEDROOM - DAY 
The curtains are drawn tight. Slivers of light illuminate the darkened room. Lisa sits on the end of the bed humming a nursery rhyme. She rocks gently. 
VOICE (V.O.) You betrayed me. You killed my nephew and took the money. 
K&R AGENT No, not us...No we did not. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   74. 
VOICE (V.O.) Remember my words. Family is everything and do not play with the process. 
The phone line goes dead. 
INT.   VETERNARY CLINIC - DAY 
Creasy still staring into space. 
RAYBURN She's dead Creasy. 
Creasy blinks away a solitary tear. 
INT. VETERNARIANS CLINIC HALLWAY - DAY 
Dogs barking constantly. Manzano walks the hall flanked by a DOCTOR and a NURSE. A second policeman, Manzano's adjutant, brings up the rear carrying two heavy binders. 
MANZANO She's dead. They fucked with 'the process' and his nephew died. 
DOCTOR He suffered gunshot   wounds to the upper extremity, chest and   abdomen. He has a collapsed lung which   is stabilized, injured his spleen,   which we may have to remove and ruptured   his intestine. He's on strict bedrest or   there's a good chance we could lose   him. 
NURSE A strange man. He has much experience of hospitals. 
MANZANO Did he say so? 
NURSE No.   But a nurse knows.

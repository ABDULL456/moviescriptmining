Carrie watches as Brian and Early disappear around a bend in the dirt road. Out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on Adele's yoyo. 
Adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the yoyo, controlling it. Until she's lost in it. A momentary refuge. 
ADELE This is called walk the dog. 
NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU 
A huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion. Its string unraveling as it spins downward. Carrie pulls her gaze away. 
CARRIE'S POV 
The desolate surrounding landscape, a bright blue sky, the scrubbrush. And no one who can help them. Carrie turns and looks over her shoulder down the hill. 
EXT. OLD MINE BUILDING 
The old mine building, rusted and deserted since the late '20's. 
EARLY So tell me... what happened here? 
BRIAN Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back. 
Flash! -- Early takes a photo with the Instamatic. 
EARLY (coaxing) ...and? 
BRIAN They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here. 
Early scans the grounds. 
EARLY Where'd they do it? 
Reluctantly Brian leads Early toward the old mine building. At the opening, Early hesitates. 
EARLY Bri. 
Brian stops in his tracks. 
EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CLOSE UP 
Adele's yoyo skitters across the gravel road surface. 
EXT. OLD MINE BUILDING 
Brian turns back to Early. 
EARLY This ain't going to give me nightmares, is it? 
EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CLOSE UP 
Then in a snap!... the yoyo recoils into Adele's palm. 
CARRIE'S POV 
A distant empty ribbon of road. 
ON CARRIE 
Her eyes searching for anyone who could help. 
ADELE (O.S.) This is one of my favorites... rock the cradle. 
INT. OLD MINE BUILDING 
Brian and Early are silhouetted against the dying sky. Flash!! Early takes another photo. 
BRIAN ...They asked them just before they were executed why they did it. They said "to be famous." (beat) Why do you do it? 
Flash!! Early takes a flash photo of Brian, momentarily blinding him. 
EARLY Do what Bri? 
Early moves slowly toward Brian. 
BRIAN We both know you didn't have to kill that gas station attendant. 
Brian's eyes dart nervously to the gun dangling in Early's palm. Flash! 
EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CU 
In slow motion Adele's hands manipulate the yoyo and string. 
INT. OLD MINE BUILDING 
BRIAN You wanted to. (beat) Why? 
Flash! Brian flinches. Early remains silent as he closes in on Brian. 
BRIAN It make you feel good? Powerful? (Flash!) Superior, what? Come on Early, tell me something. (Flash!) Were you angry? 
Early's boot lands toe to toe with Brian's shoe. 
BRIAN (tentative) Who are you angry with Early... your mother, your father? 
Eye to eye, the two men stand there.

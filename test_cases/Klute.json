DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young executive, sitting at the head of the dining room table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner. There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA PANS around the table revealing the happy family and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE. \nCamera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot of the table opposite her husband. She smiles across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone. The camera pans back down the table, only now it is empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs. Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark. She and the three children sit eating another meal in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman to a woman bereaved. \nINT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY \nThe industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little impatiently) in this direction at some loud industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then returns toward GROUP. \nThe group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT with clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying preliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat rumpled, awkward. \nKLUTE Klute. With a K. K - L - U - \nROSS Are you with plant security, Sergeant? \nKLUTE (shakes head) Town Police. \nROSS Then how are you involved? \nKLUTE (slowly) I know Tom Grunemann. \nROSS (shortcutting again) You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well? \nKLUTE We grew up together. Kids. \nROSS Can you account for his disappearance in any way? \nKLUTE No. \nROSS Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed? (aside to younger Agent, recording) -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? -- \nKLUTE No. \nROSS Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant? \nKLUTE Everybody's got some, I guess. \nROSS Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York? \nKLUTE No. \nROSS Examine this letter please. (continues) We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question. \nC.U. KLUTE \nKlute reads. We see a controlled incredulity and revulsion. \nROSS (CONT'D) He never mentioned this type thing to you? You didn't know he had these interests? \nINT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAY \nHOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward KLUTE crying out - \nHOLLY My husband was not like that! My God, Klute. \nKLUTE It looks like he sent her quite a few of those Holly -- the girl -- she recalls six or seven letters like -- \nHOLLY (calmly) -- No. I mean sure a little rough stuff, but just what people usually -- No, I would've said we were pretty good. (pause) Johnnie I don't understand. I just don't understand. \nKlute nods. She is talking for both of them. Klute looks out the window to the children playing outside. CAMERA PANS out window to Klute's POV of children playing on a cold winter day. The trees are stripped bare. \nEXT. RESEARCH PLANT \nTree lined area, lush and green - Summer. \nINT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nCAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staring outside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom Grunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS (holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective, Cable, and the plant director, STREIGER. \nKlute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then takes a last turn around the yard itself; props open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT again TO -- \nINT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nDIRECTOR (O.S.) (hastily) Honey, no, we don't have too many. \nShe slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward -- SWISH PAN -- onto a MALE ACTOR, thrusting him down to the floor, her hands at his throat. As we WIDEN TO INCLUDE DIRECTOR AND MORE OF SCENE, and as the Director reads from script, supplying a narrator voice - \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) Now before it comes to that, let's have a look, et cetera, et cetera -- OK - \nBree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as - \nANGLE TO REVEAL ROOM, OTHERS \nWe reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film equipment -- and the congery of other ACTORS and ACTRESSES preparing to read for parts. As the Director approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this quick and consecutive -- \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) -- Honey you make it look a little real. It should have, you know, that fun to it. (beat) \nBREE Strangle him to death funny? \nDIRECTOR Well we go from this into stomach diagrams. It can't be too -- look let's try it again from - \n-- but then he glances at his watch, and at the others waiting their turn. \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) No -- just give us the faces at the end, would you? \nBree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together, beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a moment, as the Director reads again - \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) (reads) -- And another family saved by Elso tablets. OK -- (brightly) Thank you very much. \n-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at the same time as he summons from a list in his other hand -- \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) Pierce -- Danner - \nBREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly as possible. \nEXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK: PEDESTRIANS - DAY \nThey trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the late-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd compacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest. She maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We see her deposit, dial. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH, BREE - DAY \nShe is connected (to her registry). \nBREE Bree Daniel, any messages? (waits -- none) OK, thanks. \nShe waits for a moment. Then makes a curious, small gesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials again, is answered. \nBREE (CONT'D) Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a commercial I thought I might get, that's all. (quickly, more brightly) Well I'd take a quick thirty, hon. Do you have a commuter for me? Wait. \nAs she prepares to write it down, we CUT BACK TO - \nEXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD: KLUTE - DAY \nKlute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn door. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door open) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the look around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls out. And on this we CUT TO -- \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY \nA GROUP -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with suitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as BREE gets off. We TRACK with her along corridor to a door. She checks number and knocks. \nREVERSE: THROUGH DOOR TO BREE \nA MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him clearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt is untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him cutely. \nBREE Hullo. \nHe mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back. She pauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) -- then quite confident, friendly, provocative all at once -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Ooh, I knew I'd like you. \n-- and CUT TO -- \nBREE \nBREE (through door, curtly) What is it? \nKLUTE (O.S.) Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute -- \nShe turns the door handle , parts the door about three inches, looks through at him. He starts to enter. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Can I talk to you? \n-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock. He stops perforce, a bit startled. A pause. A slice of Bree's face looks coldly out at him. He summons a smile. \nBREE What about? \nKLUTE My name's John Klute. \nBREE You said that. \nKLUTE I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann. \nShe tightens again. \nBREE Who? \nKLUTE Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters. \nBREE (innocently) Gee. \nKLUTE He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him. \nBREE Why? \nKLUTE You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel. \nBREE Honest? \nKLUTE Will you let me ask you some questions? \nBREE (gumbo-southern) Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun? \nHe takes out a folded letter and a wallet and passes them both through to her. Silence. She examines them with care, then appears to soften a little; even smiles slightly. \nBREE (CONT'D) You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator? \nKLUTE Mm. \nBREE And you just want to ask me a few questions? \nKLUTE Mm. \nShe smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes). Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends the stairs. \nBREE \nBree listens through the door to his departing foot steps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to assemble her properties. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY \nKlute comes out door and descends the stairs at the same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store below. \nINT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY \nIt had once been a Boutique that sold happy clothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a few remnants of its former identity. Klute's suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter. The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he enters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A case containing a tape recorder stands on the floor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes, and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately resumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets aside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the shopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins winding it. \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBree has shifted position to a window, is looking down at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND OF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her properties, whips out the door. \nEXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY \nBree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans quickly out in one direction then the other (in case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB -- makes it, pulls herself aboard -- \nBREE VOICE That's nice; who is this? \nMAN'S VOICE I really love you baby, you know that? \nA CLICK, and the MAN'S VOICE CONTINUING, trailing into helpless sobs -- \nMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Hello? Hello? Oh my God, hello? \nEXT. STREET: BREE \nBree comes out from the building (note possible costume change; not necessarily consecutive action), checks off on her list continues on her way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES. Starting with a CLICK and -- \nBREE VOICE Bree Daniel. \n2ND MAN'S VOICE (nicely) Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember, Fayetterville? \nBREE VOICE Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure. \n2ND MAN'S VOICE Well I'm in town, like to see you. \nBREE VOICE Well Frank that's awful nice but I'm out of action, sort of, you know -- \nWe FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD, CONTINUING, as -- \nBREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE, at corner, unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of frame, and we CUT TO -- \nINT. PENN STATION - DAY \nCAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package on a platform. There is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL CONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to revolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT to a shot through the windshield of car -- \nBREE'S POV \nA sea of staring faces revolves around her. We cross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if recalling a case record). \nSPANGLER (V.O.) Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty eight, good physical health, no narcotics record, presenting an unusually strong personality some ways, high intelligence, a high bracket call girl. \nEXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA \nSPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him. Across from them some prisoners are taking their exercise. Through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being caged. \nSPANGLER -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year. (notes Klute's reaction) Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why? (stabs at record) Why do you want to know all this? \nKLUTE I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it. \nSPANGLER Not unusual. \nKLUTE Did she talk about him to you? \nSPANGLER About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either. \nKLUTE Has she talked with you since prison? \nSPANGLER No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career. \nKLUTE I think she's trying that. \nSPANGLER Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction. \nINT. PENN STATION - DAY \nPOV world revolving around BREE through windshield of car. The circular motion slows down and then stops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking off platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped by one of the spectators. \nMAN (tapping her) We had a bet on - if you were real or not. I won. \nShe looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone booth. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nBREE (on phone) Marta -- \nINT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT \nMR. FABER Sure dear, yes. \nBREE Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful. \nMR. FABER (intently) Yes? \nBREE And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly -- \nMR. FABER Mm. \nBREE And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been -- \nShe hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of the cape. Faintly -- \nBREE (CONT'D) -- May I? It's so -- \nMR. FABER (quickly) Please -- \nShe stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on the couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic restlessness. \nBREE Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you. \nMR. FABER (tensely) Yes? \nBREE And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling -- \nEXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT \nKLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock. He eases door open, moves inside -- \nINT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT \nBREE is farther along in her narrative, more fervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of his seat, ducking his head now and then in pleasure, but making no move to molest her. \nBREE And next day at the beach -- our beach pavilion -- I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow -- somehow -- \nShe casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber burns her with his eyes -- \nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT \nKLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs, prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking -- sees -- \nPOV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER \nKlute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some private dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands -- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles, poses -- drifts out of view again -- \nKLUTE \nKlute watches in that direction a moment longer. In his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience -- but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure of disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it, into camera, and -- \nEXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nNear the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts angrily, miserably -- \nBREE Whyn't you just cut out? \nWe WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She comes slowly down steps. \nINT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY \nShe steps in the door, looks slowly around at his various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over the mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously -- \nBREE Oh you bastard. \nBut then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of fact hooker -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it. \nKLUTE No, I'm look -- \nBREE (vehemently again) If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard! \nINT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE \nIt is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a match, but sees no one. There is a sound of movement coming from the floor above, He runs up the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint light coming through one of the closed apartment doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one quick movement he breaks through the door. \nINT. ABANDONED APARTMENT \nThe walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings. The room is lighted by some candies stuck in bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party. They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment. Again he has been made to feel like an awkward peeping tom in this hidden world of the city. \nINT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING \nCAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow furnace room with the ceiling so low that an ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the corner looking like some strange animal from a painting by Bosch. It is Cable. \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing up against a corner shivering, immobilized. We hear KLUTE'S FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING -- she flinches -- he enters. \nKLUTE I couldn't get him. \nHe sees her condition. Gently -- \nKLUTE (CONT'D) It's all right. \nHe reaches to touch her -- she quails away from him. \nBREE Well do you think it was him? \nKLUTE What do you think? \nBREE Can't you get him? \nKLUTE Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't. \nBREE (pause) You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it. \nKLUTE Do you know where he got the dumper? \nBREE He never told me. \nKLUTE Well, let's go down and ask him. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST BUILDINGS - DAY \nA shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself -- our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W. The FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE walking upstreet, turning under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a zipper book-case). \nINT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY - ON DOORMAN AT PHONE - DAY \nThe DOORMAN hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles and gestures them graciously into the (self service) ELEVATOR. We see Klute -- without making too much of it -- taking in the mirrors and marble work. \nINT. ELEVATOR (MOVING): KLUTE, BREE \nShe breaks the silence. \nBREE What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each. \nKLUTE Is that what you gave him? \nSilence. \nINT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT: ON DOOR - DAY \nThe BUZZER sounding, FRANK LIGOURIN crossing to open the door for BREE, KLUTE. Cheerful, hospitable, nice, unpretentious. \nFRANK Bree -- hi -- come in, come in. \nThe point of this one brief shot -- Bree's face -- in the instant after Frank has spoken and before she enters, with Klute following. Her half-second of hesitation. This is someone who gets to her somehow -- probably always will. \nWIDER LIGOURIN'S APT: THREESHOT - DAY \nThe apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter. A few, large but not very good, ABSTRACTIONS on the walls. There is a large TABLE covered over with photographs and mock-ups of magazine pages, a felt board or easel with lettering samples -- Frank's props really. \nBREE Frank -- Klute. \nKLUTE It didn't go anywhere. (then) But that's not why -- \nBREE About the dumper, didn't he tell you that? \nKLUTE It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper. \nBREE (coldly) Well -- she's dead. \nAt the corner he slows, starts unzipping his bookcase as if indicating a change of route. \nBREE (CONT'D) I thought you were going back to the apartment. \nKLUTE (he shakes his head) You said you wanted these. \nHe hands over the TAPE-REELS. \nBREE Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls. (then) How come? \nKLUTE You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it. \nBREE (grudgingly) Is there anything more I could -- \nKLUTE I don't see anything, do you? \nBREE What're you gonna do next? \nKLUTE Try some other ways. (starts off) \nBREE What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me? \nKLUTE And I don't think that was Tom. \nBREE You said it was! \nKLUTE No, I said what did you think. \nBREE Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick. \nKLUTE Well -- \nBREE (harshly) Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little? \nKLUTE Yeah, you got to me. \nBREE -- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness? \nKLUTE Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know -- (hunts the word) -- too bad? Pathetic? \nBREE Goodbye. \nShe turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in passing in a litter box, departs. Klute looks after her for a moment, then turns on his way. Then -- \nEXT. POV THROUGH LITTERBOX IN FOREGROUND TO POV OF FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE - DAY \nThis shot holds both in view for a moment, until they both disappear separately in the traffic. CAMERA moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's hand comes into frame and removes the tapes. \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT \nKlute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed. A miserably hot humid night. KNOCK at the door. He answers. BREE stands in the doorway in bare feet. \nBREE What the hell do you mean, pathetic? \nShe walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his bed. \nKLUTE It's kind of late. \nBREE It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof. \nHe takes her seriously, starts to move. \nBREE (CONT'D) Oh, don't be a doo-doo. \nA WIDE SHOT. An open casting call in an Off Broadway Theatre. Darkness, except for the work light onstage. A small GROUP there -- onstage -- including the figure of BREE. Just offstage, the figures of DIRECTOR (JANG) and a PRODUCER. And the rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted with the heads of ACTORS, ACTRESSES waiting for their turns. Bree's voice rings out across the gloom. \nBREE -- Why? \nCLOSER, ONSTAGE \nThe others stand rigid as statues, facing dead front -- an experimental drama, clearly -- all holding scripts, as Bree hastens from one to another, fiercely, imploringly -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Why -- please, why? -- Why lose, why look? Why hate and give and want and love? Why get, grieve, g -- \nJANG (loudly, cheerfully) Thank you very much. \nAll break posture, start offstage, while Bree, caught in mid-stride, clowns it a little. \nBREE -- gug -- gug -- \n-- then toward Jang, a bit succinctly, indicating script -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Why? -- I want to know what. \nJANG (laughs tolerantly) No, that was very good everybody. Do we have all your resumes? \nPRODUCER (from list) Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris Chaka. \nWIDER, near stage front. \nBree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others. Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene. \nShe finds something - someone -- impeding her way. Looks up. \nPAST BREE TO KLUTE \nKlute has edged out into the aisle to intercept her. \nEXT. THEATRE ENTRANCE: GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY \nBree comes out, turns. \nKLUTE You asked if there was anything more you could help me with. \nBREE When? \nPause. Impasse. \nKLUTE I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you. \nBREE Arlyn Page. \nKLUTE Did she and Jane McKenna know each other? \nBREE Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time. \nKLUTE Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too. \nBREE Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her. \nKLUTE You could help me find her. You know the people. (as she turns away) I'll pay you a hundred dollars. \nBREE I can make that in a lunch break! (then) Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds? \nKLUTE Don't worry. \nShe examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along the sidewalk, Klute accompanying -- \nEXT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT \nIn the small hours. The same place seen previously, the gathering place. KLUTE, BREE arriving and entering. \nINT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT \nKlute and Bree head toward the rear. Her arrival causes a little stir. She exchanges greetings with one or two, is watched by others. \nMOMMA REESE Try Bill Azure. If you can find him. \nINT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING \nThis is a hangout where black and white pimps wait to meet their whores after their night of street walking. This streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin. \nWe catch only part of their dialogue. \nAZURE -- a couple weeks then she'd drift off a couple of weeks, you know what I mean? \nKLUTE Have you heard from her recently? \nAZURE She liked me all right but she had what she liked better, you know what I mean? \nWe START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats -- \nKLUTE Have you heard from her recently? \n-- and CUT TO -- \nINT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE \nPROPRIETRESS -- She'd come in and I'd let her have something. Why not; she'd been a good customer, a beautiful person, a beautiful beautiful person. \nAgain we fade sound a little before picture, then CUT TO -- \nEXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE, STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT \nOutside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn -- haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere -- \nEXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY \nA shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs. Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent. \nMRS. VASEK The whore, yeah. I threw out. \nKLUTE Do you know where she went from here? \nMRS. VASEK Live like animals. Her and the man. Out. \nKLUTE (reacts) Was she living with a man? \nWe see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE \nEXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY \nWe still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute waiting for her to catch up. \nEXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE \nKLUTE What's the matter? \nBREE (glances about) What the hell do you think's the matter. (then suggests) I could wait for you someplace. \nKLUTE If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann -- \nBREE (eagerly) -- Then you don't need me. \nKLUTE But if it's someone else I do. \nHe starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow. (There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their manners now - a reluctant collaboration.) \nBREE You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars. \n-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses street diagonally toward a half-framed house. \nINT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY \nA downshot from second floor level toward the entry way where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree climb through stench and litter to the second floor -- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates, decides against knocking, pushes in. \nINT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBERGER (O.S.) Cappy? -- Cappy? \nCappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER plunges out from the connecting room, still carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing -- \nBERGER (CONT'D) Cappy it's all right! I got a radio -- don't run, don't -- \nWe hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside, the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and races after: Klute and Bree follow. \nINT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY \nWe see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up onto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries. Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls his face against her, croons to him, soothes and tends him. \nARLYN Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby -- \nKlute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously. \nARLYN (CONT'D) Get out! (to Berger, again) Don't cry my baby; I'll find him, I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry. (to Klute savagely, incoherently) Leave us alone! Get out and get out and leave us alone! (to Berger) My honey, my baby, my baby -- \nWe DISSOLVE TO -- \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE \nCAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the figure of a woman with life screaming past her out of control. \nINT. SUBWAY \nSUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits with KLUTE staring at the open door and then without warning - gets up and runs off the train. The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train. \nSUBWAY EXIT \nSHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to be out of the darkness. \nEXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nCAMERA pans from night view of New York City to KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the mysteries of the behavior of BREE. \nSKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAlongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking to FRANK LIGOURIN. \nKLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN & BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he leaves. \nINT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY \nThe pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is the total image of the executive in control. \nCABLE She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict. \nKLUTE I believed her, Pete. \nTRASK He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything. \nKLUTE I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann. \nCABLE All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you? \nKLUTE (smiles ruefully) It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything. \nCABLE Then, close the case. \nKLUTE I better keep looking. \nCABLE Where, how? \nKLUTE (the best he can offer) I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel. \nCABLE You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom. \nKLUTE It's got to make sense some way. \nCABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her watch significantly. \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT \nDarkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed. He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket around her shoulders. The transaction is still not overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt. He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against him. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nThe street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say. Some lit windows; a single car moving past. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nAll the windows dark this time. The deepest night, just before the sky begins to lighten. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT \nKlute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach. Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory business. Her expression is more wondering than anything else -- what does she have here, and can she get used to it? \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN) \nThe street's first stirrings. From not far off, the sounds of trash cans being collected. \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN) \nKlute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for something beside the bed. Her eyes open immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying gently to press her back. \nKLUTE Go back to sleep. \nBut she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the possible Bree. She observes: \nBREE I'm still scared. (beat) I mean different but still. (frowns) Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed? \nKLUTE My bed. \nShe grins, then starts to reach for him, still receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang, turns her head away sharply. \nBREE Oh! \nHe looks at her with concern, but only caresses her. She manages to explain -- \nBREE (CONT'D) I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. \nKLUTE Mm. \nBREE No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I -- \nHe settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She responds, but: \nBREE (CONT'D) Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. \nKLUTE Yup. \nShe pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely, welcomingly, full out. \nBREE Oh -- \nAnd we cut directly to: \nINT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY \nBree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry by the throat. \nBREE The son of a bitch seduced me! \nTRASK'S VOICE All right, try this next guy. \nThe right-hand document is switched. \nKLUTE, TRASK \nKlute reacts. \nTRASK Think this is our guy? \nKLUTE I don't know. It looks familiar to me. \nTRASK Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody. \nThen -- with subdued satisfaction, switching the projector again. \nTRASK (CONT'D) Now the next cat. Mm? \nSCREEN; DOCUMENTS \nTRASK'S VOICE Same margins top and sides. He does best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside keys like Q, A, L, P and like that. Next thing look around apostrophes, how he hits the space bar before -- \nKLUTE & TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS \nKLUTE But what reason could he have? What possible reason? \nTRASK Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance. \nKLUTE I knew Tom never wrote that letter. \nTRASK What else do you know? \nKLUTE I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive. \nTRASK We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body. \nKLUTE I don't believe Tom's alive. \nAs Klute talks he paces back and forth in the darkness. He crosses in front of the lighted screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple over his face. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) But why? Why? \nINT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU \nKlute and Trask are seen entering from the Projection Room. In the background we see an old black woman sitting in front of the picture file of unidentified dead, carefully studying each picture. \nIn the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and dials. \nKLUTE Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please. \nCAMERA goes in close on Klute. \nCABLE'S VOICE (through telephone) John, how are you? \nKLUTE I'll be sending you on a report tonight. \nCABLE'S VOICE It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city. \nKLUTE It's not so bad. \nThere is a silence. Both Klute and Cable seem to be waiting for one or the other to make the next move. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Would you like to know what's in it? The report. \nCABLE'S VOICE (obligingly) What's in it? \nKLUTE I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around. \nCABLE VOICE How do you go from that to the idea Tom's dead? Suicide you're suggesting? He killed himself? \nKLUTE (plodding, unemphatic) He could've been murdered. \nINT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe apartment is a shambles -- furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped. \nINT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nKlute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree follows more slowly, whispering: \nBREE Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. \nKLUTE Don't touch anything. \nHe moves quickly to the rear of the apartment, looks at the rear window which has been broken inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the table at the front of the apartment; his folders. Bree cracks wise, unsteadily. \nBREE You suppose he's a married fella? \nANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERS \nThe contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of Grunemann in the front row. \nKLUTE \nHe stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- \nBREE He got in my clothing! \nThen a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply: \nBREE (CONT'D) Oh. Oh. \nHe turns quickly. She is holding out, at arms length, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust so extreme she can only laugh. \nBREE (CONT'D) Oh look what he did in them. \nKLUTE Drop it. \nShe doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes the garment back onto the floor. She starts to gag, slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the bathroom. Klute yanks her back. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Stay out of there. \nShe twists free of his hands, backs away. The same elementary terror we've seen before. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something. \nBREE (full out, vengefully) My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. \nKLUTE Bree -- \nBREE Right back at the start, right? \nKLUTE Go down in my room. \nBREE You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right? \nShe's broken for the door; it's questionable that she's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue -- shouts again -- \nKLUTE Go down in my room and wait. \nThen he turns back into the apartment. \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nA DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV, connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight and the scene has been invaded by POLICE TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled. Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of material in the dossier. It contains photographs of Cable and his life from childhood to the present - including pictures of him with his mother and father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a very passive looking man; also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man. They are the personal images of a life time. \nROSS (to Klute) But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann? \nKLUTE Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me. \nROSS What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that? \nTRASK Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'. \nTRASK Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up. \nBREE (brightly) Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it? \nTRASK A few more days. We know who did this. \nBREE So do I. \nTRASK No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page. \nShe spins around -- mute -- terrified. \nBREE (manages) Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide. \nTRASK Now there's a picture I'd like you to -- \nBREE You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that. \nTRASK Well we're pretty -- \nBREE Why isn't he locked up? \nTRASK We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more. \nBREE Is that why Klute didn't tell me? \nTRASK I guess he figured it was better. \nBREE What was better? I made better bait? \nTRASK No, that's not -- \nBREE Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't -- \nTRASK (coldly) From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at. \nBREE I don't have to look at anything. I don't have -- \nTRASK Here please. \nHe coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company outing picture. (We see the rip extending up through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front row.) \nBREE Oh no. \nTRASK Like for you to look for the man. \nBREE Grunemann? I've looked at him a -- \nTrask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of Grunemann, indicates with the other hand -- \nTRASK No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just look around -- I said look for the Dumper. \nWe see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows of faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp -- \nBREE Oh! -- \n-- and WE CUT TO -- \nINT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY \nCable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm, voluble, congratulatory -- \nCABLE Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time. \nKLUTE Well there's a couple -- \nCABLE I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around -- \nKLUTE Well as a matter of -- \nCABLE I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me. \nCable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then -- \nCABLE I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man? \nKLUTE Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street. \nCABLE Suppose I meet you there a half hour before. \nKLUTE Just send me a money order. \nCABLE No, I'd -- like to be in on it. \nATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the helicopter. \nKlute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a goodbye gesture. \nKLUTE Well -- \nCABLE Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night. \nINT. HELICOPTER \nCable sits down next to window. The helicopter begins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close shot of Cable against the helicopter window. The helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office building made up of endless glass squares. A telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the building directly against Cable's head and shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is almost levitating by himself. As one floor after another disappears behind him we see an almost manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on top of things once more. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY \nWe bring Klute along street, and into the Brownstone. \nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nKlute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment -- knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once -- \nKLUTE Bree? \nNo answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns back, unlocks the door himself, enters. \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe room is still disordered. Bree and Frank Ligourin look at him, silently. Bree has been assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with her. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a little -- almost apologetically. \nKLUTE I'm always getting surprises. \nBree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then \nKLUTE (CONT'D) I don't want you to do this. \nHe still doesn't extract an answer. She returns with other dresses. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Please. I said I don't want you to do this. \nBREE (tight, small) Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it. \nHe continues to look at her; she continues to gather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal with it casually -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Look, too much is going on here. I'm moving in with another girl, that's all. Just for a while. \nFRANK (helpfully) That's right. This other girl's got a very big apartment, big, plenty of room. (then) Look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right? It's -- \nHe thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from him back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his words -- unable to speak any faster. \nKLUTE No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch. \nFrank rises, both nervous and offended -- but dealing with Klute as between civilized men. Smiling. \nFRANK Klute, let's handle it like grownups? I mean we're all grown up now, right? (ventures forward) -- we all respect each other, you know what I mean? -- I respect you, Bree respects you -- you could say, it just didn't work out between you and she. But you got to respect her too -- you know, her best interests, best for her -- \nKlute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to beat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of Frank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is screaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He thrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away through the still-open door. Klute pursues. \nINT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY \nFrank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams -- \nINT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY \nKlute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the likely places -- first of all the lower hallway, then the stairwell itself, moving steadily unalarmedly up. \nAt the top he notes -- but still without main concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead -- \nKLUTE Bree -- \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY \nHe enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT BACK TO -- \nEXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY \nBree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her, nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE. \nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nKlute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO -- \nINT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY \nBree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one handed, without even lifting it from the coffee table, with an absolute lack of interest, a mechanical gesture. \nWe hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where we are watching Bree sit. \nLELA (O.S.) Mrs. Daniel -- \nWIDER - TWO SHOT \nBree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her. \nLELA -- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he -- \nBREE No. \nLELA Well I have to close up now. \nBREE Look -- could I use your phone? \nLELA Yes indeed. \nBREE Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone. \nLELA (the same tone, completely) Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me. \nBree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's inner office and switches out the lights (establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE -- \nBREE (O.S.) Is Mr. Faber there? (beat) Mr. Faber Senior. \nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY (NIGHT) \nMr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up. \nFABER Yes? (then, glancing about) Bree? \nINT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY (NIGHT) \nBREE (haltingly) -- I'm -- I just have to talk to someone. I'm just a little way across town -- \nFABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE) \nFABER Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes. \nHe hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie. Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of himself -- he leans forward against his desk and rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT) \nKLUTE on phone. \nKLUTE Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her? Will you check other people she might call? Yeah, if it wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou. \nCABLE (CONT'D) -- Is that contempt? Is it? (then) No, I'm the one who feels contempt. \n-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree. \nKlute tries to gain aim -- \nP.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE \n-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are too steadily in motion. \nKLUTE \nKlute moves on -- moves on -- gains position -- springs. \nCABLE \nCable catches the sound, whirls, screams -- \nP.O.V. TO KLUTE \nKlute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol - contends for it again, knocks it loose again. EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS. \nCABLE, KLUTE \nCable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows, exploding it outward with him, both frame and glass. \nEXT. WIDE SHOT: BUILDINGS - DAY (NIGHT) \nWe see the body tracing its quick path down the dark side of the building. \nEXT. DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTE'S P.O.V.) - DAY (NIGHT) \nEXT. BASE OF BUILDING: CABLE'S BODY - DAY (NIGHT) \nThe sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER. \nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE, BREE - DAY (NIGHT) \nKlute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree kneels on the floor. He hunkers down. In a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly withal -- as if to a child -- \nKLUTE Come on. (pause) Come on. \n(Note: also shoot in MSL, without dialogue, with SIRENS O.S. full up.) Then we CUT TO -- \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nKLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He lets her in, keeps on about his business. His expression is sober; hers is quite tentative. \nBREE Hi. \nHe doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in, sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him pack. His arm impairs him. At length -- \nKLUTE I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife. \nBREE Oh. (pause; then sharply --) Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy. \nKLUTE Mm. \nBREE You're going back? \nKLUTE Mm. \nPause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the table, starts smartly out of the room. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Wait. \nShe returns and sits on the table again, waits. But Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more -- goes on packing. \nBREE Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away? \nKLUTE (slowly) No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. (pause) \n", "test1_input": "BREE I can't say he was anybody! \nA brief pause. Klute sorts his notes. She may take it that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow. For an instant we see the undefended girl underneath -- \nBREE (CONT'D) So -- OK -- that's all? \nThen again she changes manner -- remembering a practical problem, approaching it as a matter-of fact hooker. \nBREE (CONT'D) Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and-- \nKLUTE What about everything since? \nShe draws back again. Up to now she's been reasonably on top of things. Starting now we see her driven toward the things she'd really rather not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) (prompts) Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the -- \nBREE Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves -- \nKLUTE What about the other things you've reported? -- (consulting notes) -- being followed on the -- \nBREE (interrupts -- awkwardly) Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings. (beat) I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with -- \nThe PHONE RINGS. She startles. Then approaches with some difficulty -- but then answers with complete calm in her Smith-girl voice. \nBREE (CONT'D) Bree Daniel. (listens. Brightly) Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted? (listens) Oh, well, thank you very much but maybe the next time you're in town? (listens) Well I just love Ted and I'd love to meet you -- you have a very nice voice -- but I just -- (listens, grows impatient) Well I'm having a chat with a very nice cop. Actually not a real cop; he's a private inves -- \nA BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly broken. She hangs up, recites. \nKLUTE Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else? \nBREE Most of them. \nKLUTE Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave -- \nBREE How would I remember? \nKLUTE How else do you meet them? Pimps? (a beat) \nBREE (patient) You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money. \nKlute takes up the slip of paper previously given him by Trask. In the same manner as before -- \nKLUTE I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what -- \nBREE (trembling) Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that. \nKLUTE What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber? \nShe freezes again, looking at him. Then savagely -- \nBREE You saw that, goddamn you? You saw it? He's seventy. His wife's dead. He started cutting garments at fourteen. His whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, I'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what -- \nShe chokes -- then goes on -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or -- \nKLUTE (under) -- OK -- \nBREE -- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things -- \nShe grabs up the company picture, raging on -- \nBREE (CONT'D) -- you perverted hypocrite square bastards. \nKLUTE OK. \nSomething in his inflection -- very slight -- cautions her. She falls silent as suddenly as she began. Then cheerfully -- \nBREE Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse. \nKLUTE Tell me about Frank Ligourin. \n", "test1_true": "She wanders away toward a bureau. Her shirt seems to itch her; she scratches her ribs. Then opens drawer, takes out a different shirt as -- \nKLUTE When? (beat) When did you and Ligourin break up? \nShe pulls off her shirt, unhooks her brassiere and discards it, apparently quite unselfconscious. Klute reacts; then, carefully maintaining his cool \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Mind not doing that? \nShe turns to him in total innocence, holding the shirt rather carelessly in front of her -- a new attack. \nBREE What? This? \nKLUTE -- OK? \nBREE (ingenuously) I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild. \nKLUTE No thanks. \nAt this point -- or about this point -- Klute takes note of something. A little above her. He grows more watchful, but containing it carefully. We don't understand the change in his manner -- or even notice; she doesn't. In mock dismay -- \nBREE Gee. I've had men pay two hundred dollars for me -- here, you're turning down a freebie. (pause) You can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that. \nHe has risen, is approaching her slowly -- carrying his notes as if to check something. She is hopeful again -- \nBREE (CONT'D) You've changed your mind? You do want to play? \nKLUTE (quietly, steadily) I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight. \nShe gasps, terrified -- immediately -- almost beyond control. He taps the pencil on his notes. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Easy -- pretend you're looking here- (more insistently) -- here. \nShe manages to take hold of a corner of the notes, trembling. He goes on -- \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Now I'm going to walk around -- you just keep talking, straight through, straight through. \nHe strolls away from her. His destination is the area of the door -- out of view from the skylight -- from where he can head for the roof. But he doesn't head that way directly -- first takes a turn in another direction, his bearing casual. Prompting -- \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go? \nBREE (manages, barely) I go on rounds. \nKLUTE Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking. \nBREE You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around. \nKlute has strolled out of view from above -- instantly flattens himself against the wall, eases the door open, about to slip and charge. As Bree labors on -- \nBREE (CONT'D) And they're always polite -- show people -- they say thank you very much. You lie there covered with blood, smiling, they say -- \nINT. LANDING AND LADDER TO ROOF - NIGHT \nFOOTSTEPS across the roof above, as the watcher discovers Klute's ruse. Klute opens the door -- climbs ladder to roof. \nEXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT \n-- Klute out, looking around -- \nEXT. ROOFTOPS: PAST KLUTE TO FLEEING FIGURE - NIGHT \nThe figure -- the man -- scissoring over the low walls where one brownstone joins another. Klute gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks, oddments of roof furniture -- \nEXT. SEVERAL ROOFTOPS BEYOND - NIGHT \nThe FIGURE races to a roof door disappearing into abandoned building. \nINT. STAIRWELL - ABANDONED BUILDING \nCAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way down the stairwell of the boarded up old brownstone. He gets to the first floor. He can see no exit in the building. He opens door that leads to a narrow staircase into the cellar. \n", "test2_input": "SUGARMAN No point, thanks. \nKLUTE Is he claiming the body? \nSUGARMAN Uh uh, that'd mean funeral expenses. \nHe spits, moves back in the direction of the group; Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his direction. Brokenly -- \nBERGER Man could you help me? \nKlute doesn't understand his purport, reacts instantly, sympathetically -- \nKLUTE Yeah, what? \nBERGER You know, help me out. That's my baby there, dead. I got to get up. \nKlute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger insists -- \nBERGER (CONT'D) Man you don't know what that does to me, my baby dead -- \nKLUTE -- You've got to get up. \nBERGER Yeah. \nKlute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very sharply, off the tugboat. \nEXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY \nKlute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we see what might be a profound awe and grief at all these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more. \nEFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out again. \nTRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling, looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then -- \nTRASK That's how the other one died, you know. In the water. \nKLUTE (nods) I looked it up. \nThen -- (we are assuming a complete understanding here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful? Do we both suspect the same man?) \nTRASK Well? \nKLUTE Yeah. \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nIt is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas curled up in her bed. There are some magazines scattered around the bed and the television set is on an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on the floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has spent most of the day in bed. She looks like an unkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does not answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the door bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed and goes to the door. She looks through the spy hole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locks and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the door. \nBREE Well hello -- come on in. \nHe barely enters the room. His manner is cool and remote. \nKLUTE I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead. \nBREE How? \nKLUTE The same as Jane McKenna. \nBREE (she betrays no reaction) Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you? \nKlute looks around the disorderly room. The plants in the windowsill have never been in worse shape. They look as if she deliberately let them die of thirst. \nKLUTE The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time. \nBREE (harshly) Why? \nKLUTE Just let me know when you are going out and where -- \nBREE What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic. \nKLUTE How can you do it to yourself? \n", "test2_true": "KLUTE Ligourin: How could you do it? \nBREE I told you before, you wouldn't understand. \nKLUTE You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. (pause) You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women. \nBREE No. \nKLUTE No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it? \nBREE Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk! \nKLUTE No, you can find some other way. (beat) Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to -- \nBREE (screams, incoherently) You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out! \nKlute goes. \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on (dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot propped up on it. \nFOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but doesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it, enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries to explain her wants. Then with the unhurried, graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits on the edge of the bed. \nBREE If I asked you something, would you not laugh? -- asked you to look at something? \nShe pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on her arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at her puzzledly. \nBREE (CONT'D) (apologetic) I thought it was maybe changing shape or something. \nKlute looks at it again. Judiciously -- \nHe shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She compares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to smile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves about. Her manner in general is totally unguarded, honest, undramatic, searching. \nBREE (CONT'D) Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm sorry for everybody; and I'm scared all the time. \nHe only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' -- an invitation to leave. But she won't be driven away. More urgently, helplessly: \nBREE (CONT'D) Look, I don't know either. It's like the only thing I know how to do -- I feel safe. \nShe's left the door a little ajar. He widens it for her. \nKLUTE It's been a full day. \nShe pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. A little more angrily: \nBREE Please. \nKLUTE We did this before. \nBREE No. (then) Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right. \nKLUTE (evenly, slowly) I don't like getting splashed. \nShe accepts it decently. Tries to smile again, nods. \nBREE OK ----- OK \nShe gestures, tries to find something more to say, moves by degrees toward the door -- and would succeed in leaving. But then: \nKLUTE --- Bree --- \nStanding still, she starts again to cry -- and bravely to keep the crying to herself. The child bereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving of comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then -- a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at different times of night interposed, with Bree and Klute at different times of love, As Follows: \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nThe street as we saw it just previously... still daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing toward dusk. \nDISSOLVE: \n", "test3_input": "Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT VOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of other presences. \nWe see her open the envelope -- \nCLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE \nShe finds nothing inside but money -- bills totaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a message, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her lips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding -- \nRECEPTIONIST AREA \n-- back to the reception area again. (By now this immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through the background, and continue to hear an occasional NOISE or VOICE O.S.) \nBree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer, starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back to Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then -- \nBREE Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he does, I'm at -- (reads phone) -- two seven eight, three one hundred, and I guess I can wait here five minutes; then I'll try from somewhere else. (impatiently) Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who. \nShe hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her direction. She glances up apologetically. \nBREE (CONT'D) Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave this for your father, and I wondered if you'd -- \nShe pauses -- \nANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE \nCable hastens toward her along a lane of garments. In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended as a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run -- \nBREE (CONT'D) Someone -- \n-- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT) \nKlute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically skittish message service at the other end). \nKLUTE Did she leave a number? (beat) This is a police call; don't make me take time to prove it. Did she leave a number? What is the number? (beat) What is the number? -- \nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT) \nCable and Bree. They are at some remove from the site of Cable's first appearance; there are other evidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an attempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for it, tries throughout to buy time. \nCABLE Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily? (beat) I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? -- \nBREE Yes -- all right -- \nCABLE -- We can talk -- \nBREE -- Yes. \nCABLE All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book. \nHe looks at her discerningly. She seems not to have followed his exposition. He tries patiently to clarify it. \nCABLE (CONT'D) Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her list of -- of persons. I was told you're negotiating for it on behalf of -- \nThe PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles. It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over the loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of response to it. It rings and rings as he talks and talks -- in the same expository tone as before, without raising his voice. It drowns out most of his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following -- but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor of other things torturing his soul. \nCABLE (CONT'D) That was what Klute told me -- you were negotiating for him to buy that list. And I'm in a position to pay a good deal more for it than he can. Do you understand? I'd like you to acquire it on my -- (beat) Miss Daniel, do you not understand? (beat) Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether you understand me. (beat - still reasonably) Is this something Klute just invented? Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel; does Klute know about me? \nHe turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension phones situated around the loft) -- though up to now he's given no evidence of even hearing the ringing. He just stands holding the phone for a time, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a sort of absolute quiet -- \nCABLE (CONT'D) You have no idea what I'm talking about. \nBREE Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call. \nCABLE No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me? \nBREE Yes. \nCABLE Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it? \nPause. Then he shudders slightly. \n", "test3_true": "We CUT TO -- \nEXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT) \nWe see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along street. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of it. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute mashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK TO -- \nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT) \nMLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They are somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down from one of the arched windows of the loft, while Bree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we can suppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes continually shifting, her mind calculating her chances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears her no animus at this point. His manner is rather quiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that the thing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement about what to do (with either her or himself) now. He returns toward her. \nCLOSER: BREE, CABLE \nNearing her again, he gestures several times, apologetically, seeking words. \nCABLE I've got no idea what I shall do. \nHe happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking. \nCABLE (CONT'D) I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not. \nBREE Will you let me go then? \nHe seems not to have heard the request. He sits for a moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity. (Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip her shoes off, in hopes of running.) \nCABLE It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see? \nBREE (tries again, slowly) If you'll let me go I could tell them what -- \nCABLE (unhearing, resumes) Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see? \nBREE I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes. \nCABLE Excuse me Miss Daniel? \nBREE I said yes, I see. \nCABLE (doubtingly) Oh no, I don't think -- \nBREE Tell me. I'll listen. (pause) I just want you to tell me. \nHe rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in, credulous, grateful, wondering -- \nCABLE You're willing to listen? You want me just to keep talking? \nHe hits her. \nCABLE (CONT'D) That's what you do, isn't it; you make a man feel accepted. That's what you all do. Your stock in trade a man's weakness. \nHe hits her again. \nCABLE (CONT'D) Why don't you ask for mercy? My God, what mercy has anyone given me? \nINT. ELEVATOR - KLUTE ASCENDING - DAY (NIGHT) \nEXT. GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT) \nKlute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way across the roof. Man in hotel window across street holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity. Klute spots entrance to stairway. \nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT) \nKlute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber loft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE BEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact sounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted, undramatic). He maneuvers through lanes of garments, trying to gain a line of sight. He understands what's going on, strains to intervene, but can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops to hands and knees, slides underneath the garment racks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain position. We intersperse his progress with further Bree-Cable fragments, as for instance -- \nFRAGMENT: CABLE, BREE \nCABLE You're a person of no value, you have no value -- \nKLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSER \nKlute works his way steadily closer -- under steadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and beating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at hand the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of footsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than distinct. Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE clearly enough to make out words -- \n"}

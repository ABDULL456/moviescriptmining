DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young executive, sitting at the head of the dining room table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner. There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA PANS around the table revealing the happy family and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE. \nCamera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot of the table opposite her husband. She smiles across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone. The camera pans back down the table, only now it is empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs. Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark. She and the three children sit eating another meal in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman to a woman bereaved. \nINT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY \nThe industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little impatiently) in this direction at some loud industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then returns toward GROUP. \nThe group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT with clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying preliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat rumpled, awkward. \nKLUTE Klute. With a K. K - L - U - \nROSS Are you with plant security, Sergeant? \nKLUTE (shakes head) Town Police. \nROSS Then how are you involved? \nKLUTE (slowly) I know Tom Grunemann. \nROSS (shortcutting again) You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well? \nKLUTE We grew up together. Kids. \nROSS Can you account for his disappearance in any way? \nKLUTE No. \nROSS Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed? (aside to younger Agent, recording) -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? -- \nKLUTE No. \nROSS Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant? \nKLUTE Everybody's got some, I guess. \nROSS Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York? \nKLUTE No. \nROSS Examine this letter please. (continues) We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question. \nC.U. KLUTE \nKlute reads. We see a controlled incredulity and revulsion. \nROSS (CONT'D) He never mentioned this type thing to you? You didn't know he had these interests? \nINT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAY \nHOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward KLUTE crying out - \nHOLLY My husband was not like that! My God, Klute. \nKLUTE It looks like he sent her quite a few of those Holly -- the girl -- she recalls six or seven letters like -- \nHOLLY (calmly) -- No. I mean sure a little rough stuff, but just what people usually -- No, I would've said we were pretty good. (pause) Johnnie I don't understand. I just don't understand. \nKlute nods. She is talking for both of them. Klute looks out the window to the children playing outside. CAMERA PANS out window to Klute's POV of children playing on a cold winter day. The trees are stripped bare. \nEXT. RESEARCH PLANT \nTree lined area, lush and green - Summer. \nINT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nCAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staring outside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom Grunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS (holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective, Cable, and the plant director, STREIGER. \n", "test1_true": "CABLE (turns sharply, interrupts) It's been almost a year! Tom Grunemann's been missing for a year. And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you. \nROSS (restraint) Well sir. \nSTREIGER Are you closing the case? \nROSS No sir, we don't state that. We're countin -- \nCABLE But you don't find it worth much effort. \nROSS (injured dignity) Well Mr. Cable, you've got me here from the Bureau. You got Lieutenant Trask here from New York representing his department and I don't frankly consider -- \nSTREIGER (moderating, suggesting) Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl? \nROSS (refers the question) Trask -- \nTRASK (summarizes from notes) We first hold her under surveillance expectin your boy Grunemann to show up there. Didn't. Then we bagged -- we arrested her on a CP charge, convicted, two month's women's city prison, offer to reduce sentence, she cooperated. (counts) Four interrogations. She thought she remembered Grunemann -- from those letters from before, she made that connection -- but she hadn't seen him since and couldn't identify his photograph and she -- \nSTREIGER Why not? \nTRASK Oh a good call girl, she'll turn six-seven hundred tricks a year. The faces get blurred. (resumes) And since then, recent months, she's reported several, you know, incidents: like breather calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her, watching her, things like that. So it's I guess you could say, conceivable Grunemann's still around there, just hangin around her, spooking her. But you know, that -- \nHe shakes his head, gestures doubtingly. Ross caps it. \nROSS The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands. \nSTREIGER Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves. \nROSS Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent -- \nSTREIGER Klute offered us his services; we've accepted. \nPause. Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a bit startled - then at each other. Klute just looks uneasy. \nSTREIGER (CONT'D) Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case -- \nROSS (sourly) Yes sir, we know he -- \nSTREIGER We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and -- \nROSS (tactfully) Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well -- \nTRASK (to Klute, leniently) Ever done any missing person's work? \nROSS Spent much time in the city? (to others) You see, I have to wonder -- speaking frankly; the Sergeant knows I'm only speaking frankly - \nCABLE You wonder why we thought of Klute? Frankly? He's interested. \nINT/EXT. WIDE SHOT: PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nVerdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near at hand an open field set about with bee hutches and patched with mist. \nA FIGURE, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across frame from the left, blanking in. We reorient to - \nINT. BEDROOM - KLUTES HOUSE - DAY \nWe see that we've been looking out from the bedroom window of this house. Klute turns to rolltop desk in bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of Bree Daniel, and other material he has collected on the case. He puts them in his suitcase and closes the suitcase. He shuts rolltop desk. \nINT. KLUTE'S HOUSE - DAY \nWe follow Klute through the house with suitcase. He puts away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and electricity, and so on -- takes a last look around - reaches for the door handle. WE CUT TO -- \nINT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUND STAGE - DAY \nA section of wall, a door coming open -- and the FIGURE of BREE entering and standing. We have gone from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv darkness. \nShe appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine picture. But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor. Assailable. WE CUT TO - \nEXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD, HOUSE, BARN - DAY \n", "test1_id": 2145, "test2_input": "SUGARMAN No point, thanks. \nKLUTE Is he claiming the body? \nSUGARMAN Uh uh, that'd mean funeral expenses. \nHe spits, moves back in the direction of the group; Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his direction. Brokenly -- \nBERGER Man could you help me? \nKlute doesn't understand his purport, reacts instantly, sympathetically -- \nKLUTE Yeah, what? \nBERGER You know, help me out. That's my baby there, dead. I got to get up. \nKlute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger insists -- \nBERGER (CONT'D) Man you don't know what that does to me, my baby dead -- \nKLUTE -- You've got to get up. \nBERGER Yeah. \nKlute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very sharply, off the tugboat. \nEXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY \nKlute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we see what might be a profound awe and grief at all these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more. \nEFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out again. \nTRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling, looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then -- \nTRASK That's how the other one died, you know. In the water. \nKLUTE (nods) I looked it up. \nThen -- (we are assuming a complete understanding here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful? Do we both suspect the same man?) \nTRASK Well? \nKLUTE Yeah. \nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nIt is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas curled up in her bed. There are some magazines scattered around the bed and the television set is on an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on the floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has spent most of the day in bed. She looks like an unkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does not answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the door bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed and goes to the door. She looks through the spy hole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locks and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the door. \nBREE Well hello -- come on in. \nHe barely enters the room. His manner is cool and remote. \nKLUTE I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead. \nBREE How? \nKLUTE The same as Jane McKenna. \nBREE (she betrays no reaction) Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you? \nKlute looks around the disorderly room. The plants in the windowsill have never been in worse shape. They look as if she deliberately let them die of thirst. \nKLUTE The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time. \nBREE (harshly) Why? \nKLUTE Just let me know when you are going out and where -- \nBREE What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic. \nKLUTE How can you do it to yourself? \n", "test2_true": "KLUTE Ligourin: How could you do it? \nBREE I told you before, you wouldn't understand. \nKLUTE You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. (pause) You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women. \nBREE No. \nKLUTE No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it? \nBREE Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk! \nKLUTE No, you can find some other way. (beat) Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to -- \nBREE (screams, incoherently) You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out! \nKlute goes. \nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on (dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot propped up on it. \nFOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but doesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it, enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries to explain her wants. Then with the unhurried, graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits on the edge of the bed. \nBREE If I asked you something, would you not laugh? -- asked you to look at something? \nShe pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on her arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at her puzzledly. \nBREE (CONT'D) (apologetic) I thought it was maybe changing shape or something. \nKlute looks at it again. Judiciously -- \nHe shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She compares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to smile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves about. Her manner in general is totally unguarded, honest, undramatic, searching. \nBREE (CONT'D) Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm sorry for everybody; and I'm scared all the time. \nHe only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' -- an invitation to leave. But she won't be driven away. More urgently, helplessly: \nBREE (CONT'D) Look, I don't know either. It's like the only thing I know how to do -- I feel safe. \nShe's left the door a little ajar. He widens it for her. \nKLUTE It's been a full day. \nShe pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. A little more angrily: \nBREE Please. \nKLUTE We did this before. \nBREE No. (then) Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right. \nKLUTE (evenly, slowly) I don't like getting splashed. \nShe accepts it decently. Tries to smile again, nods. \nBREE OK ----- OK \nShe gestures, tries to find something more to say, moves by degrees toward the door -- and would succeed in leaving. But then: \nKLUTE --- Bree --- \nStanding still, she starts again to cry -- and bravely to keep the crying to herself. The child bereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving of comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then -- a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at different times of night interposed, with Bree and Klute at different times of love, As Follows: \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nThe street as we saw it just previously... still daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing toward dusk. \nDISSOLVE: \n", "test2_id": 2146, "test3_input": "TRASK'S VOICE All right, try this next guy. \nThe right-hand document is switched. \nKLUTE, TRASK \nKlute reacts. \nTRASK Think this is our guy? \nKLUTE I don't know. It looks familiar to me. \nTRASK Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody. \nThen -- with subdued satisfaction, switching the projector again. \nTRASK (CONT'D) Now the next cat. Mm? \nSCREEN; DOCUMENTS \nTRASK'S VOICE Same margins top and sides. He does best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside keys like Q, A, L, P and like that. Next thing look around apostrophes, how he hits the space bar before -- \nKLUTE & TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS \nKLUTE But what reason could he have? What possible reason? \nTRASK Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance. \nKLUTE I knew Tom never wrote that letter. \nTRASK What else do you know? \nKLUTE I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive. \nTRASK We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body. \nKLUTE I don't believe Tom's alive. \nAs Klute talks he paces back and forth in the darkness. He crosses in front of the lighted screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple over his face. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) But why? Why? \nINT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU \nKlute and Trask are seen entering from the Projection Room. In the background we see an old black woman sitting in front of the picture file of unidentified dead, carefully studying each picture. \nIn the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and dials. \nKLUTE Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please. \nCAMERA goes in close on Klute. \nCABLE'S VOICE (through telephone) John, how are you? \nKLUTE I'll be sending you on a report tonight. \nCABLE'S VOICE It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city. \nKLUTE It's not so bad. \nThere is a silence. Both Klute and Cable seem to be waiting for one or the other to make the next move. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) Would you like to know what's in it? The report. \nCABLE'S VOICE (obligingly) What's in it? \nKLUTE I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around. \nCABLE VOICE How do you go from that to the idea Tom's dead? Suicide you're suggesting? He killed himself? \nKLUTE (plodding, unemphatic) He could've been murdered. \n", "test3_true": "KLUTE No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something -- \nCABLE'S VOICE Have you discussed this with them? \nKLUTE It's in the report. \nCABLE'S VOICE Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them? \nKLUTE I wanted to give it to you first. \nCABLE'S VOICE All right. All right -- (then) John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right? \nKLUTE All right. \nCABLE'S VOICE Thank you. Goodbye, John. \nKLUTE Goodbye, Pete. \nKlute hangs up. \nKLUTE (CONT'D) He was always at their house on holidays. Tom and Holly always had him, over on holidays. Tom felt sorry for him - his whole life was work. Tom felt sorry for him. \nThe old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to her. She points to a picture in the file. She has obviously found her missing person among the photographs of the unidentified dead. She starts to stand but then sits again, obviously shaken. Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of the chair. He sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend. \nEXT. OUTDOOR MARKETS - EIGHT AVENUE - NIGHT \nKLUTE & BREE \nBree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper. She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity, and Klute is amused by her enjoyment. \nOUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKET \nThe nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the avenue. \nKlute and Bree wander through the plants. \nBREE I saw Mr. Faber. (beat) You remember Mr. Faber, don't you? \nKLUTE (controlledly) Yeah. \nBREE Is that all you have to say? \nKLUTE What am I supposed to say? \nBREE Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more. (pause) I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore. \nShe is like a child awaiting praise from her teacher. Klute says nothing. They continue walking among the plants and he picks up a few that she had admired. \nKLUTE Well, here's your gold star. \nConsidering his contempt for all the dead plant life he has seen in her apartment in the past, she is pleased by this act of belief in her. \nBREE Spangler says we have a relationship. \nKLUTE What? \nBREE You and I -- a relationship. \nKLUTE I was wondering what that was. \nBREE (beat) Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life. \nEXT. BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHT \nBree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the sidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself, enjoys the evening. \nINT. STAIRWALL - NIGHT \nWe follow them up. \n", "test3_id": 2147}

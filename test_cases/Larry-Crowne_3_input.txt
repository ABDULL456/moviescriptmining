COX Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm. 
EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Less cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift. 
INT. UNIMART - ELECTRONICS - LATER 
Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is fastidious in his work. The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by. 
VASQUEZ LC Why still here? 
LARRY CROWNE Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy. 
VASQUEZ I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of. 
LARRY CROWNE Probably to clean up after the party. 
VASQUEZ Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be. 
LARRY CROWNE Speck-tack-alar. Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps. 
VASQUEZ 
You're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this be? 
LARRY CROWNE Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two! 
INT. MEETING ROOM #2 - SAME 
Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats. 
LARRY CROWNE Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile. 
STRANG Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves 
LARRY CROWNE I think I know what this is about. 
STRANG I don't think you do. 
COX Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us. 
LARRY CROWNE Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking. 
STRANG I take it back. 
COX Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas. 
(THEN) 
It is touchas, right? Where you get kicked? 
HURLEY Yeah. A yiddish word. 
ANDREWS Like the buttocks. 
HURLEY Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous. 
COX Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it. 
LARRY CROWNE UniMart is firing me... 
STRANG Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job. 
LARRY CROWNE Why me? 
ANDREWS Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so. 
LARRY CROWNE Why not Strang? Strang snorts. 
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form. 
HURLEY Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Larry Crowne has no idea what that means. 
COX 
Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder. 
STRANG Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded. 
LARRY CROWNE I won't make the Front Office? 
STRANG Never. (shows his college ring) S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true.

Raining. 
An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home. 
BUD V.O. Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one. 
INT. CHEVY - NIGHT 
Bud's in the front seat, looking through a file. Shepard at the wheel. Coffee cups and junk food litter the dash. 
BUD Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives. (turns the page) Seven and a half out of a twelve year stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola. A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released from Oxford, 1981. 
SHEPARD Jacket's the size of the bible. 
Through the windshield, across the street, a tract home they're watching. 
BUD His stay at Marion, they kept him in "H" block. 
SHEPARD H block? That's home to forty top murder one inmates... 
BUD Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had twelve years. 
Bud likes it. 
BUD He ain't just woodwork. 
DISSOLVE TO: Night passes and the dawn arrives... 
EXT. WHEELER'S HOUSE - DAWN 
Front door opens and the shadowy figure of JESSE WHEELER, whose face we cannot see, emerges. 
SHEPARD (waking Bud) Target's out. 
Jesse fires up his '74 battered green PICK-UP TRUCK. He backs from the driveway and proceeds down the street. 
BUD (into radio) Alright. Give him room. 
Bud's car starts and we move off with them... 
BUD (into radio) We're mobile. 
EXT. STREETS - MINUTES LATER 
In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance. 
They pass an alley where a waiting BUICK falls in behind the Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside. 
INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: 
We see the truck slowing, angling into a TEXACO STATION. 
SHEPARD He's turnin' off. 
BUD Let's take him in the car. (into radio) Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your backgrounds. 
INT. JESSE'S PICK UP - MOMENTS LATER 
Jesse stops at a pump. Suddenly, Bud appears at the window and jams a SHOTGUN against Jesse's head. 
BUD Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow your head clean off. 
Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's BADGE swings from his neck. Jesse's eyes resign to relief. Bud SEES this... 
BUD Shut the car off slowly. 
With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from all directions, Jesse turns off his engine. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in unison around the house. 
Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard... 
Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays quietly inside. No one in the windows. 
Shepard signals to Marandino... 
INT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE 
THE FRONT DOOR IS KICKED DOWN. Shepard and Marandino spill in, guns ready... 
SHEPARD POLICE! WARRANT! 
A pregnant woman in the kitchen... LYNN WHEELER, 30s. She SCREAMS, curses. Hurling dirty dishes fly like frisbees. 
LYNN GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE! 
MARANDINO MA'AM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN! 
SHEPARD WE GOT A WARRANT! 
LYNN (more dishes) FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! 
Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor. A GUSH OF FLUID soaks through her dress.

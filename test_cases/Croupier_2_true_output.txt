REYNOLDS watches him, looks to JACK and nods. JANI collects her winnings and throws two chips to JACK. She stands up to leave. 
JACK I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa. 
JANI (surprised) You know where I'm from? 
JACK nods and gives her back the two chips. 
JACK I've lived there. 
JANI (sweetly) Well, thank you anyway. 
JACK watches her leave. 
JACK'S VOICE Bright woman, he thought. She knew the rule of gold. Quit when you're ahead. 
JANI heads towards the cashier. JACK sees REYNOLDS arguing with the irate ARABIC MAN near the entrance. 
He looks back to the table. 
JACK Place your bets. 
On his way out the ARABIC MAN looks towards JACK and makes an occult sign with his hand. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
It is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S winnings, quickly and efficiently. 
JACK stiffens. He sees that something is wrong. MATT moves piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up. JACK glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his winnings and leave. 
INT. BMW - NIGHT 
Again MATT is driving JACK home. 
JACK (hesitantly) Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating. 
MATT (violently) What the fuck are you talking about? 
JACK That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s. 
MATT (angry) I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. 
JACK I'm not going to report it. 
MATT slams on the brakes. The car comes to an abrupt stop. MATT turns to JACK, furious. 
MATT What are you, a cop? 
JACK If I see you do it again, I'll report it. 
MATT I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? 
JACK Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that. 
MATT So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. (softens) I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. 
JACK You're talking about complicity. 
MATT I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat. 
MATT holds out his hand for JACK. JACK shakes it. MATT grins. 
MATT OK, now let's unwind. 
He puts the car into gear and drives off. 
JACK'S VOICE Matt was an escape artist. Like Jack's father. 
EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the restaurant.  He and JACK get out of the car and go through the open kitchen door. 
INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

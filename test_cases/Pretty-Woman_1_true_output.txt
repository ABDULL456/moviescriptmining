VIVIAN (cont'd) Is that while you're the boss everyplace else... I'm the one in charge here. 
She kisses his chest. 
VIVIAN (cont'd) You... just think you are. 
She starts to kneel down.  He stops her.  They stare at one another for a moment.  He releases her.  She smiles.  She starts to undress him. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING 
Vivian is asleep.  She turns over, slowly waking.  Her hand goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed. Vivian comes awake with a sudden start.  She look around momentarily frightened, not sure where she is.  Sighing with relief, she lies back down.  She sees Edward's American Express card on the pillow next to her. 
EDWARD (O.S.) Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop. 
Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed. He is tying his tie.  Vivian sits up and ties it for him.  He smiles at her. 
EDWARD I still don't understand why you only bought one dress. 
VIVIAN I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. 
EDWARD Why not? 
VIVIAN Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works. 
EDWARD Was someone rude to you? 
VIVIAN I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool. 
EDWARD Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you. 
Edward sits on the bed. 
EDWARD (cont'd) People aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself. (a beat) The next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here. 
He softly touches her, right between the eyes. 
EDWARD (cont'd) It's an old trick I use, especially with bankers.  Works every time.  Will you try it? 
VIVIAN (confidently) Okay. 
EDWARD Good. 
VIVIAN (a beat) Come with me? 
Edward looks at his watch.  Vivian covers it with her hand. 
VIVIAN Please. 
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY 
A beautiful, chic women's shop.  The haughty SALESGIRL approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses.  Edward hovers in the b.g. 
VIVIAN (nervous) Hello.  Can you help me? 
The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down.  A Pause.  Vivian gives her "the stare" and straightens up.  We see the Salesgirl's reaction change. 
VIVIAN (confidently) I'm looking for a dress, nothing too flashy, not too sexy, conservative.  In a size six. 
SALESGIRL (uncomfortable under Vivian's stare) Do... do you have a charge account with us? 
Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card. The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to find Vivian's size. 
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS 
Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the Salesgirl's supervision. 
Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low cut, spangled and fringed outfit.  Edward shakes his hand.  The Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit. Vivian scowls. 
VIVIAN (sighing) I look like fucking Nancy Reagan. 
INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE 
The Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor.  He turns to find Vivian happily holding up a tiny, low cut leather dress. Edward shakes his head in mock disapproval.  Vivian scowls. 
INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER 
Vivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress.  Edward is standing at the store's bar, watching and talking on the telephone. 
INT.  STUCKEY'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT WITH EDWARD 
Stuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to Edward on the speaker phone.

Joe at his hotel window staring out blankly. Gun fire O.S.... 
INT. SHOOTING GALLERY - DAY 
The radio at Joe's ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat, shooting alone in the gallery. Two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks. Joe moves on, unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay phone.

Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his radio on the night stand. O.S. his love theme, remote, hollow... 
EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT 
Joe's radio is at his ear "... never too late to look great, Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a.m., miles and miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks and nobody walks." For the first time, Joe is aware of the other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways, the cruising queens, the middle-age men in sport shirts. Joe moves on self consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously massaging his night stick. Camera holds on a window display of gag buttons, featuring NEW YORK WILL BREAK YOUR HEART, BABY.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE DANCE HALL - DAY 
Joe's radio promises job opportunities for young men eighteen to twenty-five in the U.S. Air Force. He stands with a crowd staring up at a girl go-go dancing in the window of SERGEANT PEPPER'S LONELY HEART CLUB.

Joe staring in the mirror. O.S. static over his love theme. 
EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT 
By work-light, the tarrier in metal helmet leans on a jack hammer, beyond the sign DIG WE MUST, drowning out Joe's radio.

Joe flexing his muscles in his jockey shorts while -- LIVE ON TV SCREEN -- a physical culture personality finishes push-ups and starts pitching his own extra protein bread. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY 
Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry cook flips flapjacks in the window. But Joe's eyes are on a sign DISHWASHER WANTED. Joe looks up and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage behind the counter. It's Joe. 
JOE Shee-it. 
STILL PHOTOGRAPH 
Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street, unable to concentrate on his comic book. On two-way radio, a woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When I can't sleep, well, I just dial the time and listen to those old seconds clicking by like, you know, counting sheep?" 
EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR 
Joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady, at the same corner where Ratso waved to another young man. The woman's predatory eyes linger momentarily on Joe before she leads the young man into the Cafe. The two-way radio continues over, "... that's what I do about insomnia." 
JOE Well, now, ma'am, next time you got that feeling coming on, you dial Joe Buck. I'll show you what to do...

Joe straddles a chair, staring at a blank TV screen. 
SINGING COMMERCIAL Need a little easy money? It's E-Z. Want a little easy cash? It's E-Z. 
E-Z LOAN COMMERCIAL 
As the jingle continues, we follow Joe and his radio into the loan office, the depressing reality photographed and edited in the style of a TV commercial: 
JINGLE Easy locations to get to Easy ladies to greet you Easy chairs to seat you Easy payments to meet Let E-Z set you On Easy Street Joe arrives confident Harassed E-Z receptionist Lines of uneasy customers Desperate, angry faces Reams of E-Z forms to fill Clerk's sneer, says Joe has to be kidding

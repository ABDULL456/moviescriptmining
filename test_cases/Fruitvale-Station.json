You gonna give me a reason to? \nSophina doesn't answer. The phone rings again. Oscar's hand quickly picks it up and flips it open. We follow the phone to his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old Black man with a warm smile. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) (into phone) Aye bruh it's bad tonight. I gotta catch you tomorrow. \nHe closes it before the guy on the other end can respond. He takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with SOPHINA MESA, a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) Look, I'm not going out, you happy now? \nSophina nods. Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her neck. She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away. \nOscar kisses her again. Puts his hand in her hair. \nSOPHINA Osc. Osc, hold up. \nOscar stops. Sophina scoots away even further. \n(CONTINUED) Pink (6/25/2012)                                              5. 2      CONTINUED:                                                   2 \nOSCAR Man, wussup?

FIRST FRUIT LEARNING CENTER- DAY                         6 \nOscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car. \nWe see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down mirror. \nOscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places something inside of it. \nTatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger over his lips. \nTatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile. She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and knocks on the front door. \nMRS. STACY a motherly looking Black woman in her 50's opens the door. \nMRS.

The light aint even on yet. \nShe looks at the dashboard where there is a PICTURE of Oscar holding Tatiana tucked in the glass. The fuel gage sits almost under E, but the light still isn't on. \nShe stares at the store entrance. \nSOPHINA You gonna go home and sleep, right? \nOSCAR Naw, Imma go up to the job.

FARMER JOE'S PARKING LOT- DAY- MOMENTS LATER         A11 \nWe see the entrance of Farmer Joe's, and shoppers coming in and out.

FARMER JOE'S- DAY- MOMENTS LATER                        11 \nIt is a moderately sized grocery store, but several SHOPPERS move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron. \nCato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the counter. \nCATO Sup Osc, bruh? \nOSCAR Shit.

What's good for the countdown though? \nOSCAR Frisco. Fireworks and the whole shit- \nOscar sees something out of the corner of his eye. He motions his head for Cato to look. Cato turns and sees- \nKATIE, a White girl in her mid 20's, playing with her iPhone while waiting for help. Cato quickly makes his way over. \nCATO You ready? \nKATIE Uh, yeah...

Pssst! \nOscar snaps his head to Cato, who motions for Oscar to look down the aisle. \nOscar looks over and sees, EMI, a thirtysomething Hispanic man wearing a white collared shirt and a name tag. He checks the shelves with a barcode scanning device. \nOscar slowly heads over. \nOSCAR Good morning, Emi. \nEMI Oscar, what's going on?? \nOSCAR Had to grab some stuff for my Mom's birthday. \nEMI I hope you found everything that you need. \nEmi turns and starts for the next aisle. \nOSCAR Emi, hold up man, I wanted to talk to you. \nEMI It's a little nuts right now, holiday and all.

You can start me back off with one shift a week or whatever. I'm here. You can work me 40 hours a week and pay me for 20. I'm here. \nEMI Oscar, dude. I hired somebody else. For me to hire you back, that means I have to let someone else go. Someone with no felonies. Who's never showed up late once. I like you man, but I can't do that. I'm sorry. If something else opens up, maybe I'll let you know. Take care of yourself. \nEmi walks away. Oscar watches him. \nCHANTAY No it's not.

HALLMARK STORE- DAY                                   18 \nThe store is small and brightly lit. Oscar is reading a card from off the BIRTHDAY FOR MOTHER rack. \nWe see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking on the beach holding her son's hand. Inscribed over it are the words to the religious poem \"Footsteps\" by Anonymous. \nOscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before. Oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat. He looks up, moved by the words. He stares off into space. \n19     INT. VISITING ROOM- SAN QUENTIN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY-     19 TEN MONTHS EARLIER \nWe look through a foggy window at Wanda sitting at one of several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around them. There are a few VISITORS already sitting at tables with inmates. Several Corrections Officers stand by. \nWe see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and- \nBUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room to Wanda's table. As he approaches she stands up. \nOSCAR Hey Ma. \nOscar gives her a hug, leaning across the table. \n(CONTINUED) Green (7/5/2012)                                  27. 19      CONTINUED:                                       19 \nWANDA What happened to your face? \nOSCAR You look nice. \nWanda shakes her head. \nCLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog, places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes off running towards the street. \nOSCAR Shit! No, No, No Stop! \nSCHREECH... BAM! We hear it before we see it. A sickening sound. An animal YELPS, a car SPEEDS OFF. Oscar runs into the street chasing a car going too fast for us to see. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) (at the car) Hey! Stop you bitch ass Muthafucka!! \nHe stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in the street. It's the dog, and he's in bad shape. Oscar picks the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk. \nOSCAR (CONT'D) (whispering) Come'on boy.

The dog starts to violently shake... \nHe becomes unnaturally still. \nOscar stares at the Dog for a long beat, shaken up by this. He looks around, no one seems to have noticed. \nHe bends down, closes the Dog's eyes, and heads for his car. \n23     EXT.

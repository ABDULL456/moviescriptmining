He arches his back and we see his vertebrae multiply and stretch. His paws extend into gnarled and pointy claws. His color changes from white to grey to a muddy, cloudy black. It forms a perfect vampire's peak on his head - 
Mr Whiskers has transformed into a VAMPIRE CAT. 
WEIRD GIRL Mr Whiskers? 
The VAMPIRE CAT starts to fly around the room manically knocking into things on shelves and on the walls. He ends up on the sky light. 
WEIRD GIRL Mr Whiskers. 
With one flap of its wings, he flies out the window and up into the stormy night sky. 
INT.   SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
E races out of the classroom into the corridor screaming. Hearing the commotion the gym teacher opens a different classroom door. 
GYM TEACHER Hello? Is someone there? 
The gym teacher tentatively makes her way down the corridor to the classroom E has just run from. She opens the door. 
A beat.

EXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT 
The earth around the mausoleum rumbles. 
NASSOR Rise, colossus. Rise from your tomb! 
As Nassor continues his incantation, we see a MUMMY HAMSTER emerge from the mausoleum. His shadow is huge. Nassor watches with his mouth open his gaze moves down to the ground. 
It might be frightening if the Mummy Hamster weren't just a few inches tall. 
EXT.   TOSHIAKI'S YARD - NIGHT 
A bottle of Miracle-Gro lies empty on the grass. Toshiaki steps out of the garden shed and walks over to the scorched patch of grass. He looks around the garden. 
TOSHIAKI Shelley? 
Suddenly, a massive turtle foot SMASHES down, crushing the shed. 
A GIANT TURTLE MONSTER -- bigger than a bus -- SHRIEKS to the heavens. 
Toshiaki scrambles to get away, alternately impressed and terrified. 
The turtle opens its mouth, and lets out a blood curdling roar. Distracted by the Dutch Day lights the Turtle monster heads to town. 
EXT.   BACKYARD POOL - NIGHT 
An almost-translucent hand grabs the side of the pool, pulling itself out. And it's not alone. 
Dozens of SEA MONKEYS emerge: simian warriors with shrimp-like features, some carrying bone tridents. 
Bob SCREAMS and runs out of the garden followed by the sea monkeys.

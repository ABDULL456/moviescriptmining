HELEN I'm not going to let you do it, Tom. (with deep personal urgency) Believe me, this is literally the most important thing in the world. 
Tom picks up the phone and answers it. 
TOM (into phone) Yes?... What's his name, Margaret? General Cutler? (disappointed that the connection isn't completed) All right, I'll hold on. 
Realizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading wildly, desperately. 
HELEN Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved! 
TOM (exasperated) I don't care about the rest of the world! 
It is as though he had slapped her across the face. Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. Feeling guilty as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries the old charm, holding his hand over the phone. 
TOM You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers. 
HELEN (staring at him starkly) I feel different right now. 
TOM (uneasily) You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero! 
HELEN I'm not going to marry anybody. 
She turns and runs quickly out of the room. Tom's inclination is to follow her, when his connection is completed. 
TOM (into phone) Hello, General Cutler? (irritated) No, I don't want to speak to his aide. I want to speak to the General. Tell him it's about the space man... My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n- s.

The General is on the phone and is making notes. There are a couple of officers standing near his desk, a Colonel and a Lieutenant Colonel. 
GENERAL CUTLER (after listening for a moment) Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens. I'll want to talk to you further but I haven't time now. (hangs up and turns to Colonel) Deploy all Zone 5 units according to Plan B -- immediately. 
The Colonel nods and starts out of the room, as we--

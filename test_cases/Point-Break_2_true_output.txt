The group stabilizes, moving together. First Bodhi and Roach link arms, trimming constantly. Concentrating.  Nathaniel flips over onto his stomach and maneuvers toward them.  He grabs Roach's arm. Grommet works his way next to Nathaniel.  Locks in. They need Utah to complete the ring. Four faces beckoning to him, distorted by the hurricane wind. 
BODHI Come on Johnny.  Get in here! 
Johnny moves his hands like flippers and glides clumsily toward them.  Bodhi and Grommet grab him.  He's in. A perfect five-man star. 
BODHI Relax, brah.  I got you, I got you. 
GROMMET Righteous-ass speedstar, dudes! 
BODHI You diggin' this? 
UTAH Great!  GREAT! 
Johnny is exhilarated more than he could have thought. Screaming down through the dawn sky at 130. Locked into the ring.  Part of something. Connected to these guys far above the planet. Less far every second... Bodhi's chest altimeter reads 6,000 feet. 
BODHI Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles, folks.  See ya downtown! 
He releases Roach's arm and the star disintegrates, drifting apart. Bodhi stays with Utah, falling parallel to the horizon, facing each other, holding hands.  4000 feet.  Airspeed 
Grommet pulls his ripcord.  He seems to be jerked upward by a great force.  Suddenly he is far above, a brightly colored disc of fabric. Utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him. Nathaniel pulls, then Roach.  They shoot upward, disappearing. Bodhi and Utah fall on, alone. 
BODHI You gonna pull? 
UTAH After you, Alfonse.  I insist! 
Bodhi looks at Utah.  A slow grin.  The meter on his chest harness reads 2000 ft.  150 mph.  12 seconds to Valhalla. 
BODHI Don't screw around man, pull it! 
UTAH You do it... you first! 
BODHI One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord! 
UTAH You first! 
BODHI Okay! 
Bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls Utah's ripcord handle. He waves goodbye as Johnny's canopy deploys.  Utah is jerked upward.  He feels his weight hanging brutally in the harness. Johnny looks down. Impossibly close to the ground.  Bodhi's canopy BURSTS OUT, an explosion of color.  Below him is the shimmering mirror of a LARGE RESERVOIR.  Two seconds later the bright yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack.  An explosion of white water marks Bodhi's impact. 
LOW ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL as Utah hits. IN SLOW MOTION a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts skyward. Molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn. Utah surfaces, sputtering, and shucks out of the harness. He floats like a jellyfish, gasping for breath. 
UTAH Jesus Christ.  I gotta be losin' it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  AIRFIELD - DAY 
Bodhi walks toward us, dripping wet and grinning. He wraps his arm around Utah's shoulders as the others walk up. They're all soaked and stoked. 
BODHI Ya see... I told you Johnny U was gonna be just fine! 
Roach and the others clap him on the back.  A moment of acceptance into the tribe.  Utah isn't sure what it means yet. 
BODHI C'mere.  There's something you need to see. 
Bodhi leads him toward a PLAIN UTILITY VAN parked nearby. It was there earlier but Utah had no reason to notice it. Bodhi opens the rear doors and motions Johnny inside. Utah, puzzled and suddenly alert, steps in.  Bodhi follows. 
INT.  VAN - DAY 
The interior is empty except for several canvas duffel bags and a small portable VCR.  It is one of the new sales presentation models, with deck and monitor together in one tiny unit. 
UTAH What's this? 
BODHI Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play. 
Utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny screen. 
TIGHT ON SCREEN.  A night shot.  Rosie the biker has Tyler in a powerful grip.  Her hands are cuffed behind her, and her mouth is taped.  He has his switchblade up to her throat.  Her eyes are wild, but with rage, not fear. She's trying to struggle out of his grip, kicking at him viciously. He controls her efficiently. Bodhi stops the tape. 
BODHI She's a wild one, isn't she... Special Agent Utah?

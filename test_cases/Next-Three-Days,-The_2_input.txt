MICK (O.S.) Let me in, asshole!! 
153   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS                      153 
Mick bangs again. 
MICK (O.S.) Open up! (more banging) Your car is in the garage, I know you're in there! 
154   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                                    154 
John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows he can't let his brother see this. 
The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls. 
MALE NEIGHBOR What's your problem? He's not home! 
MICK Not home?   So you're saying I'm blind? 
MALE NEIGHBOR No, I'm saying you're an idiot. 
(CONTINUED) 
154   CONTINUED:                                                             154 
Mick pounds on the door aggressively.      Then just gives up. 
MICK You know what? You're right.    I am an idiot. 
And he walks off to his car. 
155   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                                       155 
John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away. 
156   OMITTED                                                                156 AND                                                                          AND 
158   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING                                         158 
John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers. 
LUKE (O.S.) ...Dad? 
159   EXT. PARK -- DAY                                                       159 
John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost.      Luke trots up. 
LUKE Can I have my cookies? 
JOHN You hungry?    You want your sandwich? 
LUKE No. 
John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention. 
NICOLE Carrie! (to John) I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out. (John nods awkwardly) Nicole. 
JOHN I remember. 
(CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED:                                                           159 
NICOLE (knows he doesn't) Really? 
JOHN (smiles and admits) I remember your daughter. 
NICOLE She's hard to forget. (digs in her bag) Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home. 
Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday invitation with jungle animals on the cover. 
JOHN He has his father's memory. 
NICOLE It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife. 
JOHN I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated. 
NICOLE I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch. (to John) We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us? 
JOHN Oh, we're pretty...you know.... 
NICOLE Busy? 
John smiles, busted. 
NICOLE (CONT'D) Come on, we owe you for the cookies. 
JOHN That's true.     And I made those cookies. 
NICOLE And learned how to pre-package them. 
(CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               159 
JOHN Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke. 
They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind. Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment. 
NICOLE Do you trade off time with Luke? 
JOHN No. Luke and I are together full time. 
NICOLE Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.

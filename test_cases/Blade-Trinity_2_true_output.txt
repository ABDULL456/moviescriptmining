Blade just stares daggers at Vance. 
VANCE What about the President?  Do you know who's in the White House at the moment? 
BLADE An ass-hole. 
VANCE (sighing) Alright then, let's talk about vampires -- what can you tell me about that? 
INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have joined Chief Vreede.  We hear Blade and Vance via speakers: 
BLADE There's nothing to tell.  They exist. 
VANCE And are you one of them? 
INT.	POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Vance sits forward, drawing closer. 
VANCE What about blood?   When you drink it, do you find yourself sexually aroused? 
Blade just glares at Vance. 
VANCE You see, it strikes me that this business of vampirism has strong connotations of sexual confusion.  Bodily fluids being exchanged, that sort of thing.  You have to ask where that comes from.  I'm wondering, for instance, what your relationship was like with your mother. Were the two of you close? 
Blade glares.  If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy. 
INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Dr. Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale. 
VREEDE What's your assessment, Doctor? 
VANCE He's psychotic, with paranoid features, possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy. He's exhibiting disorganized behavior.  He obviously doesn't have a properly formed conscience -- (spreading his hands) For his safety and the public's, I'm recommending that he be transferred to County Psychiatric for further treatment. 
CUMBERLAND That's unacceptable.  This man's wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes.  I need him on a plane to the Detention Center in Washington tonight. 
VANCE Agent Cumberland, that man is in no condition to undergo prosecution. 
Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief. 
HALE Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant here that clearly supersedes -- 
VREEDE I don't care about your warrant.  We're in my jurisdiction now.  You've got an issue with that, you take it up with the local magistrate. 
Dr. Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry. 
VANCE I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has already been made.  A team from the hospital should be here momentarily to oversee the transfer. 
INT. POLICE STATION - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT 
Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by FOUR VAMPIRES dressed as orderlies.  The orderlies carry a straightjacket, various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney. 
Danica approaches the DESK SERGEANT, flashing a hospital ID. 
DANICA Hi.  We're here to transfer a patient to County General? 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Vance enters once more.  He opens the leather case on the table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid. 
VANCE (speaking softly now) Just a little something to keep you compliant.  The normal dose is two, maybe three hundred milligrams.  But for a strapping young hybrid like yourself -- 
Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule. 
VANCE -- I think we'll kick it up to a couple thousand. 
Vance reaches for Blade's arm.  Blade struggles, tries to pull back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless. 
VANCE There.  That wasn't so bad, was it? (smiling) You're weak, aren't you?  In need of your serum.  Who would've guessed a mere human like myself could overpower you? 
BLADE (realizing) You're with them -- a familiar -- 
VANCE Going on five years now. 
Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to reveal a VAMPIRE GLYPH tattooed on the underside of his wrist. Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade. 
VANCE It's the end-game, Blade.  All their plans are finally coming to fruition.  So just sit back and enjoy the show.

EXT. STREET CORNER CASH MACHINE Elliot looks up and sees Paisley emerging from Steven's building. He crosses the street toward her. W hen Paisley sees him, she seems to freeze. 
EXT. THE BARRYMORE THEATER 47th Street between Broadway and Eight Avenue. 
Nicky walking slowly backwards, arm raised, trying to hail a cab. It is getting dark. He glances left, sees a large two- panel poster in front of the theater. One half is a black-and- white photo -- a younger Nicky Rogan, in a tuxedo, holding an award in his raised hand. 
The other half is all type -- 
SIDEWALKS The new Nicky ogan 
He sees someone enter the theater lobby. It is his daughter Laurel. He follows, catching up to her at the end of a short line of people at the ticket window. 
NICKY Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked. 
LAUREL Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going. 
NICKY Opening night? 
LAUREL I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition? 
Laurel reaches the window and speaks to the clerk. 
LAUREL Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. 
NICKY Take it yourself. Take a date. 
AUREL I don't have a date. I don't want a date. 
They leave the window with Laurel's ticket. 
NICKY And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk. 
LAUREL I have a class. I'm late. 
NICKY Can we talk later? Will you be at the party? 
LAUREL I'm not sure. 
She is out the door, hurrying across the street. Nicky stands under the marquee, calling out to her. 
NICKY I'll find you. After the show. Somewhere. 
INT. TAXI Moving very slowly. 
Driver's nameplate -- 
MOSHOESHOE IBRHIM 
DRIVER A man is hit the other day by another taxi. I mean he is flying. Crash against the windscreen. Right here in my face. Blood is everywhere. 
NICKY I never left the garage without my Windex. 
DRIVER I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen. 
NICKY I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.

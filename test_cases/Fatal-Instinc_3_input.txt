She thrusts it toward Ned's face! There's a business card stuck on the end. He pulls it off. 
ANGLE - CLOSE ON BUSINESS CARD 
It reads: LE HOT CLUB! No Air Conditioning... And Proud Of It! Scribbled next to it is the message... "Meet me at 7:30". The edges of the card are scorched. 
INT. LE HOT CLUB - NIGHT 
It's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded... and HOT. Everybody is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes. 
Ned enters, sees Lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg crossed provocatively over the other. A beer can is stuck to the gum on the bottom of her shoe. It falls off with a CLUNK. 
He sits on the stool next to her. She looks at him, smiles. 
NED Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked me to take care of this. 
He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a LIT CIGARETTE. It has a very long ash. 
LOLA Thanks... 
She takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then... 
NED You smoke too much. (looks around, then) It's hot tonight. 
LOLA Is it? I never know. My body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal. 
He notices the drink in her hand is BOILING. A saxophone begins to softly wail Lola's Theme. Ned looks over to see a QUARTET, featuring Dizzy on sax. The GUITARIST spontaneously bursts into FLAME! A FIREMAN, in full gear, jumps up from the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. None of the band members miss a beat. 
NED Maybe we should look for a cooler place. 
LOLA I doubt we'll find one. Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. I go out there expecting to find a cool breeze... but it's just a lot of hot air. 
Ned glances at the MALE CUSTOMERS... sitting at the bar across from them. They're staring coldly at Ned. 
NED What're they lookin' at? 
LOLA A lot of them have tried that seat. You're the first one's lasted this long. 
NED I feel honored. 
LOLA Don't. It's broken. 
A beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a CRASH! Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over. 
NED Did you bring the... papers? 
LOLA No. I thought you might come over... 
NED Sure. I'll drive you. 
LOLA I brought my own car. 
NED I'll follow you then. 
LOLA I know it sounds silly, but would you leave first... wait in your car? I come here a lot and I wouldn't want those men to think I'm "easy"... a slut who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat. But if you leave first... 
NED ...they'll think I'm a putz for passing up a sure thing. 
Lola stares at Ned for a long moment... then SLAPS his face. He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. Then, suddenly, she SLUGS HIM so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar! 
LOLA (for all to hear) Now leave me alone! 
She pauses to give him a flicker of a COY SMILE... then picks up her drink and moves to a nearby table. Ned struggles to his feet and staggers to the door. 
INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT 
Ned is a mess! Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. Shirt soaked in sweat. He turns the radio ON. LOLA'S THEME starts playing. 
A small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, turning slowly. The venetian blinds on his side windows are partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light. 
ANGLE - HIS POV OF ROAD 
He's following Lola's car. It signals and turns left. 
INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT 
Still hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan. It spins faster. MUCH faster! The car becomes like a wind tunnel! 
EXT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a large two story house surrounded by lush greenery. 
Ned climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side and sticking out crazily. 
ANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV 
It opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe. She casually shakes it off... going to the front door. 
INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
They enter. It's DARK. Ned squints into the shadows. 
NED Well, here we are... in the dark.

EVELYN Yes. He never forgave him for it. 
GITTES Never forgave him for what? 
EVELYN For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day. 
GITTES (starts a little) You sure shout that? 
EVELYN Of course I'm sure. 
GITTES What about you? Do you and your father get along? 
Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply. Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn. 
GITTES Sign here... The other copy's for you. 
She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring intently at her. 
EVELYN What are you thinking? 
GITTES (picking up one of copies, folding it, putting it in his pocket) Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it. 
INT. SEAPLANE 
The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along. 
One of the old men says something to him. 
GITTES (above the engines) What? 
OLD MAN You'll have to sit with the pilot. 
Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up Â– nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese sandwich out of Gittes' seat. 
EXT. HARBOR - SEAPLANE 
Taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it kicks up a spray of foam and takes off. 
INT. COCKPIT 
The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and Gittes. 
The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane. 
PILOT (above the engines) Well, you're not going fishing. 
Gittes shakes his head. 
GITTES Not exactly. 
PILOT (winks) But that's what you told your wife. 
The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely. 
PILOT Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty? 
GITTES (abruptly) I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him? 
PILOT Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people. 
GITTES I'm working for his daughter. 
PILOT (surprised) That right?... She used to be some looker. 
GITTES She ain't exactly long in the tooth now. 
PILOT She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four. 
GITTES You must be thinking of a different daughter. 
PILOT No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away. 
GITTES She ran away? 
PILOT Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing. 
He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned he's said too much. 
PILOT (continuing) Course, she settled down nicely. 
GITTES (smiling a little) Well, you never know, do you? 
PILOT (loosening up) That's for sure. 
GITTES Why'd she run away? 
PILOT Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen. 
GITTES (nudging him) We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal? 
Both men laugh a little lewdly. 
PILOT She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it. 
GITTES You don't say? 
PILOT Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.

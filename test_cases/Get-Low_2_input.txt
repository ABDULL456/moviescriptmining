86 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 86 
Frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes. The phone is ringing off the hook, there are full sacks around him, and some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds. 
87 EXT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - DAY 87 
Frank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but beautiful piano music coming from inside. It stops abruptly when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears. 
FRANK Hey Mattie. He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in. 
FRANK Was that you? It was really.. 
MATTIE This is a surprise. 
FRANK Yeah, sorry. He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here. She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels about this adoring look. 
MATTIE Was there something you..? 
FRANK Uh, yeah.. Help! 
MATTIE What? 
FRANK I'm up to my ears with this funeral and I thought, you know, we haven't had time to talk much lately so maybe you'd like to come over and rip open envelopes with me and 
MATTIE I'm sorry, I have lessons all afternoon. I have to get back in. 
FRANK Oh, okay, I just.. 
MATTIE Sorry. She slips back inside. Frank stares at the door. 
88 INT. MATTIE`S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 88 
Mattie leans against the door with her eyes closed. There is no student at the piano.

91 EXT. CHURCH/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - AFTERNOON 91 
The hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board church. 
91A INT. HEARSE - AFTERNOON 91A 
Close on Bush and Buddy. 
BUSH Don't say nothing. 
BUDDY To who? 
BUSH You can say "hi". Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out. 
92 INT. ILLINOIS CHURCH ENTRY - AFTERNOON 92 
Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church. 93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93 sanctuary. Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window at the driveway, and then at Buddy. 
BUDDY Hi. 
CHARLIE Hello. Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances at the door but Bush is not coming in.

ABEL Jesus. 
ANNA I mean it. We can't just leave it here. 
EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT 
ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on the side of the road. 
He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares back at him. ABEL walks back to the car. 
ANNA Is it dead? 
ABEL No. 
ANNA Well you need... 
ABEL I know. 
He reaches down to open the trunk. 
ANNA What are you doing? 
ABEL Getting the tire iron! This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on edge. 
ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it. Then he sits with the animal a beat longer. 
We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron waiting... BANG! BANG! 
Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder. He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special- style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the pistol. The deer is dead. 
He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun? She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car. He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road. 
INT. ABEL'S DAMAGED CAR - NIGHT 
ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. We hear ABEL'S footsteps as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in silence. 
INT. MORALES HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The door opens and ABEL walks in. ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. 
ANNA Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine? 
NANNY MARIA Oh yes. All is good. 
ANNA Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then. 
NANNY MARIA Okay. NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod. ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each other. 
ANNA What? 
ABEL What? 
ANNA Yes... what? 
ABEL Are you kidding? 
ANNA No. ABEL Okay then... what is this gun? 
ANNA I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... I did something about it. 
ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the room from each other. He just waits... finally. 
ABEL Where did you get it? 
ANNA You know where I got it. 
ABEL Do you have a permit? 
ANNA Not yet. This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer. 
ABEL You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. You are trying to protect your children? Protect them? Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing? 
He is now standing right over her. 
ABEL (CONT'D) You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are. 
ANNA You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound? 
They are really going at it now. He tries to grab her purse, which she still has over her shoulder. They struggle for it. 
ABEL Where is this thing? Let me see it.

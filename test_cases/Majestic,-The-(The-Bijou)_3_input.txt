Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby.  He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU." 
But not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U."  Luke winces. 
EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY 
Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it takes shape in a prominent place in the square... 
INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila -- new screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge, standing below, applaud enthusiastically. 
INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY 
As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful. 
As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. Transported. 
After a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows. 
LUKE That was beautiful. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER I taught you that. 
LUKE I can play the piano? 
MRS. TERWILLIGER (all fluttery) Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say. 
She sits at the piano. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Sit.  Play with me. 
LUKE No, I... 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Some of it might come back to you. 
Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER That's good... that's good... 
But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed. 
MRS. TERWILLIGER Really, Luke!  That's no way to treat Mr. Chopin! 
She stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning madly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to Luke's bass line. 
OLD TIM 
is tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says: 
OLD TIM I taught him that. 
Off Adele cracking up. 
THE MONTAGE CONTINUES... 
EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY 
Luke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train goes by.  This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a jaunty angle.  Luke smiles. 
INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY 
Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter, devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are stained with paint specks. 
At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably with Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to refill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back to the newspaper he's reading. 
INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN 
Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying headline: 
BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH Hollywood Writer Feared Dead Were Red Agents Involved?

EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT 
Luke's standing near the sign.  He yells to Adele, down below on the ground.  She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a switch panel behind the candy counter.  He throws the switch... 
... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle and shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele, Harry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted, Luke takes a formal bow.  The boogie-woogie ends as we

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY 
ON THE MEMORIAL 
Complete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the square. 
WIDER 
It's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out. Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.  He finishes his remarks, then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost lives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head. 
ON THE CROWD 
One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones. 
Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform...

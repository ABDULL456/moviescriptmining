WAYNE KYLE Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf-- 
DEBBY Wayne-- 
WAYNE But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it. 
CHRIS The guy was picking on Jeff. 
WAYNE KYLE That true? 
JEFF (eye swollen) Yes sir... Yes, he was... 
WAYNE KYLE (turns to Chris) And did you finish it? 
Chris shows the swollen knuckles of his hand, and nods. 
WAYNE Then you know who you are... 
13   EXT. BARN                                                   13 
A GROWN MAN(CHRIS) exits the barn into the light of day. Behind him, horns of dozens of bucks cover the wall. 
WAYNE (VO) You know your purpose. 
The barn door closes leaving us in brindled darkness. 
"AMERICAN SNIPER" 
14   EXT. RODEO ARENA                                            14 
A hand grips the tie on a bronc. CHRIS sits bareback atop the horse, its nostrils steaming, eyes shock wide. (ECU)-- a hair-line crack along its right front hoof. 
BUZZER SOUNDS. GATE OPENS. The bronco leaps out. Empty stands blur past. The Bronc and Chris united in a futile struggle. He leans right, the bronc circles right, staying off that bad hoof. Chris makes the buzzer but-- 
He gets tossed on dismount. The bronco stomps his hand. He scrambles out of the ring as RODEO CLOWNS distract it. 
FIND JEFF(19) ringside, with tight lips and severe eyes. He looks over the empty arena, laughing. 
15   INT. FORD TRUCK                                             15 
Headlights rattle over a dirt road. JEFF drives. CHRIS rides, BAG OF ICE on hand, BELT BUCKLE prize on the dash. He stares into the field where A WILD HORSE, races alongside them, a spectral image in the darkness. 
JEFF Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. What you supposed to do with it? 
CHRIS (grabs belt buckle) You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood. 
JEFF A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood. 
CHRIS Is that what they say? 
JEFF You know what they called her in high school-- 
CHRIS Don't say it. 
JEFF Sarah suck-a-- 
Chris swings his bag of ice, smacks Jeff in the face. 
JEFF Shit man-- 
He swerves off the road. The truck almost coming apart before he ramps back up, coming to a dusty halt outside-- 
16   EXT. BUNKHOUSE                                              16 
Spanish moss hangs over a shackle-board residence. Chris tumbles out the truck, clips on the belt buckle and-- 
17   INT. BUNKHOUSE                                              17 
CHRIS swaggers into the narrow bunkhouse. A sheet hangs in back, separating sleeping area from living area. 
CHRIS Who wants to hump a rodeo star? 
Movement back there. A MAN ASS suddenly protrudes from the curtain as a BURLY COWBOY-TYPE climbs into jeans. 
CHRIS What the fuck-- 
SARAH steps out, his high school sweetheart all grown up. 
SARAH You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow. 
CHRIS (wounded) Why would you do this? 
Cowboy leaves his shirt open flaunting a big hairy chest. 
SARAH Just let him out. He didn't know... 
CHRIS (shamed, steps aside) You didn't know? 
Cowboy doesn't answer. Chris SLAMS HIS HEAD into the refrigerator and ramps him out the front door. 
SARAH What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend! 
CHRIS Get out. 
She jumps at the chance-- ripping clothes out of closets. 
SARAH You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? You're no cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay!

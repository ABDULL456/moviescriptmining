Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie, Hitchcock and Sloan push through the glass doors to the crossroads of the operating rooms. Through each window, we see operating crews hacking away. 
MRS. CHRISTIE Is she dead? 
MRS. KIMBALL Well, they had to open her up, and that's not good. 
They gather in anticipation outside O.R. Three and peer over each other's shoulders into the room where the operating crew is hunched over the open-heart massage. The masked circulating nurse looks up, notices the audience at the door, and gives a hopeless shrug. 
HITCHCOCK I better get Mr. Mead. 
HOLLY PAVILION, THE STAFF ROOM 
Milton Mead is sitting in a back seat of the Staff Room -- a lounge with couches, easy chairs and magazine racks -- gives half an ear to the several opinions being simultaneously expressed by: 
LADY FROM WOMEN'S LIB ...abortion? The clinic should be under the supervision and entirely staffed by women and administered by a member of the Women's Committee for Medical Liberation! 
and by 
YOUNG WHITE ACTIVIST ...let's get to the core of the matter which is the criminal and gangster collusion between the American medical establishment and the drug, insurance and tobacco companies who, through their combined racketeering efforts, have produced a dual system of health care. Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor! 
and by 
BLACK PANTHER ...abortion clinic! That's genocide, baby! You're just killing off blacks! We consider proliferation elemental to the class struggle! 
and by 
SUNDSTROM (who has lost his cool altogether and is screaming right along with everyone else) ...for God's sake! We've got eleven people in these buildings, and we've got to get them out of there! We can rectify the injustices of the world tomorrow, but right now, for God's sake, can we get those people out of those buildings? Will you people please listen to me? Will you people please shut up and listen to me? Will you people please call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem?! 
During this maelstrom, the phone at Mead's elbow RINGS. Mead answers it, listens, nods, returns the receiver, stand and slips out of the room into the delicious silence of the... 
HOLLY PAVILION, EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR 
...where Hitchcock emerges from the Administration offices. The two men move down the hall toward each other. 
MILTON MEAD How long ago did this happen? 
HITCHCOCK About half an hour. 
MILTON MEAD Have you called the Medical Examiner? 
HITCHCOCK Not yet. 
MILTON MEAD Well, you'd better do that now. And you better call the precinct station house as well. 
OPERATING ROOM THREE 
Dr. Mallory is wrenching off his blood-drenched rubber gloves and flinging them to the floor in a rage. The door to the room opens, and Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie and Mr. Sloan enter. Dr. Mallory is stupefied with anger. Dr. Chu, blessed with Eastern containment, blandly gathers his equipment together, nods to Mrs. Christie. 
DR. CHU Good morning. 
MRS. CHRISTIE Good morning, Doctor. 
DR. CHU This is really something, isn't it? I thought she looked a little different when they brought her in. I even said to one of the nurses, "She looks a little younger without her dentures." I'd only talked to her half an hour before. 
MRS. CHRISTIE Does anybody know who she is? 
Dr. Mallory can only stare at her numbly. He turns and stares numbly at Mr. Sloan. 
MRS. CHRISTIE (to Mrs. Kimball, examining the chart dangling from the operating table) What's her chart say? 
CIRCULATING RESIDENT Her chart says Mangafranni. Her bracelet says Mangafranni. The only thing that isn't Mangafranni is the woman. 
Dr. Mallory finally explodes.

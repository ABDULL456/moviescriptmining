NAOMI Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's crown, the Empire State Building. This iconic symbol of American corporate might was adapted during World War 2 in case of attack from enemy forces. At three minutes' notice the entire structure can retract into the ground like a tortoise's head. 
TOURIST That's not possible. I should know, I'm a civil engineer. 
NAOMI You're not being very civil to me. 
Some tourists laugh. 
ARTHUR The building doesn't retract; the ground rises up. 
NAOMI Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank you, sir. 
ARTHUR They were going to install giant legs so if a plane was flying at the tower it could run away. But where's it going to run? 
NAOMI Manhattan's in the way. 
ARTHUR It'd have to jump in the Hudson. 
NAOMI Victory to the Nazis. Is that what you want? 
The group approaches a pretzel stand. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits. 
The group lines up to get their pretzels. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Do I know you from somewhere? 
ARTHUR If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ. 
NAOMI What are they? 
ARTHUR The gossip websites. 
NAOMI That the internet? Ah, my computer's too old for all that. 
ARTHUR For the internet? Seriously? 
NAOMI Life's too short for all this obsessive upgrading. 
ARTHUR You consider the internet an upgrade? Wow. 
NAOMI So why do people gossip about you? 
ARTHUR Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody. 
Arthur feels a tap on his shoulder. Hobson. 
HOBSON You're late for your mother! 
NAOMI (TO ARTHUR) Sorry, this pretzel stand is a watering hole for the crazies. (raises her voice to HOBSON) The soup kitchen's just up and to the left, honey. 
ARTHUR Hobson, this is... (reads her badge) Naomi. 
NAOMI She's with you? 
HOBSON Delighted to meet you, Naomi. Normally one has to go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature. 
NAOMI Ooh, Grandma's got jokes. 
HOBSON You aren't the first woman who walks the streets this young man has asked. 
NAOMI Who's this? Joan Rivers' older bitterer sister? 
ARTHUR My nanny. 
NAOMI Obviously. Seriously, who is she? 
ARTHUR My nanny. Well, she started as that, but these days she's more of an all-round enforcer and bodyguard. 
Naomi looks at her watch and glances to the tourists, chewing on their pretzels. She starts to walk away. 
NAOMI Sorry, I have to get out the cattle prod and haul ass. Got another tour starting in eight minutes. 
ARTHUR Can I call you? 
Naomi starts to walk away. 
NAOMI I don't give my number to grown men with nannies. But as you may not be a grown man, it's 917 476 2030. 
Manhattan swallows the lovely stranger.

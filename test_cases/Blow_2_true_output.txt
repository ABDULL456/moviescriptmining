GEORGE My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you. 
RAMON OCHOA Congratulations on your conquest of the West Coast.   How much bigger can we get? 
GEORGE Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning to tap the market.  If it's accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will follow. 
They all agree.  Mirtha still gives George the teeth from across the room.  Diego returns to the table. 
AUGUSTO We are talking about George's West Coast operation. 
DIEGO Ah, George's mystery man. 
RAFAEL OJEDA Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet him? 
DIEGO You don't meet him.  George keeps this a secret.  He's here meeting everyone, goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but still keeps his secrets.  Even from his brother. 
JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO" Come on, George, we're all in this together. 
EMILIO OCHOA Yes, George, there's enough for everybody. 
GEORGE I think Padroni is happy with the current situation.  Will you please excuse me? 
George exits after Mirtha. 
INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 
George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha.  He can't find her.  She appears from the shadows and startles him.  George embraces her and plants one on her. 
MIRTHA You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire. 
GEORGE I like fire.

EXT. FIVE STAR HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - DAY 
George and Mirtha poolside, wearing shades, getting some sun. She blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair.  He blows one back.  She licks her lips and it's on.  He's out of the chair, pouring champagne over her tan body, and licking it off.  She squeals with delight. A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.  A hotel manager comes over, but George hands him a wad of cash and he quickly fucks off. 
INT. MIAMI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT - MAGICAL REALITY 
The dancing is in SUPER SLOW MOTION now.  Passionate, carnal, intimate.

Overhead shot of George and Mirtha's bedroom.  It's completely covered with money.  Completely covered.  George and Mirtha make love on the sea of cash.  As CAMERA PULLS UP we see money slowly falling from the ceiling. 
INT. SILVER STAR WEDDING CHAPEL - LAS VEGAS - 1978 - DAY 
There is no white dress.  There is no tuxedo.  George and Mirtha haven't even taken off their sunglasses. 
MIRTHA I do. 
They kiss.  Mirtha wipes her red nose. 
MIRTHA (CONT'D) I need a fucking drink. 
INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
George moves to the bedroom.  Mirtha is pregnant and she's showing.  She's also bent over a mirror with a straw in her hand.  George opens the door and takes her by surprise. 
GEORGE Jesus Christ.

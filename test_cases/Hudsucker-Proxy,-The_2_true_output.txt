The screaming pack of schoolchildren round a corner and -- stop short, their screams abruptly halting. 
They are staring, fascinated, at the hula-hooping youngster. 
The children are dumbfounded. It is a moment the likes of which they have never dreamed.

Jam-packed with screaming children, grabbing hula hoops off the shelves. 
BACK TO NORVILLE'S OFFICE 
Norville sits slumped behind his desk, his head resting on the desktop, utterly dejected. 
Suddenly the TICKER-TAPE HUMS to life and starts spitting tape. Amy looks at it with mounting excitement. Finally she looks breathlessly up: 
AMY ...Norville! 
Norville lifts his head from the desktop. A piece of scrap paper is sticking to his cheek. Dramatic FANFARE MUSIC STARTS TO SWELL. 
We HOLD ON Norville's expectant face. We HOLD. The MUSIC BUILDS. We HOLD. We:

NEWSREEL TITLE 
We can see the "Tidbits of Time" logo as a solemn-voiced announcer intones: 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Rockwell News presents... 'Tidbits of Time!' World news in pictures, we kid you not. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Picture dissolves to a pan up the Hudsucker Building. 
Cut to candid film of Norville getting out of a car, noticing the camera, grinning and waving as he walks, and taking a pratfall. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...What began as the brainchild of this Madison Avenue whiz kid is now a craze sweeping the nation. The 'hula hoop,' product of Hudsucker Industries, is a recreational device that some experts predict may eclipse the television as a means of entertainment... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
A television sits against a neutral b.g. A hula hoop rolls into frame and bumps the TV, pushing it out of frame. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...This dancing dingus of delight, this jerky circle of gaiety, is proving to be the toy of choice of most American youngsters. -- Whoa- ho! Did I say youngsters?! Here's mom, taking a break from her household chores... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
A woman switches off her vacuum cleaner, takes a hula hoop that is conveniently leaning against a nearby wall, and starts hula hooping. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...and even dad is 'swinging' into the act! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
In the office, dad, smoking a pipe, is also hula hooping. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...and so the congratulations pour in for up-and-comer Norville Barnes, inventor of the hoop -- including one very special call! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
In jerky cinema-verite footage, a woman is excitedly sticking her head in Norville's door. 
WOMAN (V.O.) He's on! He's on the line! 
Swish over to Norville, agog, who picks up his phone and, voice breaking: 
NORVILLE (V.O.) ...Hello? 
CRACKLING VOICE (V.O.) Hello, Norville. This is the President... 
A half-wipe leaves a split screen with half of the screen remaining Norville, the other half becoming a still of Ike standing in a tank turret, pointing commandingly. 
Under the photo: VOICE OF GENERAL DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. 
NORVILLE (V.O.) Oh my God, sir! 
IKE (V.O.) ...I just wanted to congratulate you. I'm very proud of you, Norville... 
NORVILLE (V.O.) Oh my God, sir! 
IKE (V.O.) ...Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you. The American people are very proud of you.

NORVILLE 
Facing a battery of REPORTERS at a news conference. 
REPORTER #1 Mr. Barnes, how'd ya come up with the idea for the hula hoop? 
Norville is holding one hand up to shield his eyes from the unaccustomed light. Amy stands next to him, beaming. 
NORVILLE Well, it was no great idea, really. A thing like this, it takes a whole company to put it together, and I'm just grateful for the opportunity -- 
REPORTER #2 Mr. Barnes, did you have any idea there'd be such a huge response? 
NORVILLE Well, frankly, I don't think anybody expected this much hoopla --

INT./EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DUSK. 
A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three decades at least. 
Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a bathing suit named ADHARA.  She advances slowly, not entirely sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do. At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine.  He looks her up and down, more from reflex than anything. 
She continues on.  Eventually she emerges through sliding glass doors and on to a patio. 
HER POV 
A figure by the pool, talking on the phone.  His back to us. The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed. 
ADHARA 
Approaches, then sits beside him.  His voice is soothing, but with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being slightly ahead of everyone. 
VALENTINE (into phone) Not before.  Not before.  Think about it. What does it mean?  What -- no, I'm not. Think.  Yes.  See?  You figured it out all by yourself.  I know.  Are we done? Okay. 
He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn. 
VALENTINE Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation. 
ADHARA I used to hate it.  Now I like it. 
VALENTINE Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum. 
He turns and we see him for the first time. 
VALENTINE 
Polished.  Handsome.  Charismatic.  Especially when he's smiling like he is now.  He leans over and kisses her. 
VALENTINE Is there anything in the world that you want or need? 
ADHARA I want to know why you need that scary guy in your house. 
VALENTINE Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks. 
ADHARA Then what good is he? 
VALENTINE Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty? 
ADHARA Is that a problem? 
VALENTINE Not for you, clearly. 
ADHARA I'm loyal to things that make me happy. 
VALENTINE Am I a thing? 
ADHARA Well, you're certainly not a person. 
VALENTINE I'm not. 
ADHARA No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe. 
VALENTINE I'm so glad we're having this chat. 
ADHARA It's not a knock. 
VALENTINE It's not a compliment. 
ADHARA It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating? 
VALENTINE As soon as you get dressed. 
ADHARA What kind of food? 
VALENTINE Anything but Japanese. 
ADHARA Why? 
VALENTINE I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy. 
ADHARA Like you. 
VALENTINE I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars. 
ADHARA You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist. 
VALENTINE It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions. 
ADHARA For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience.

CHARLIE (buddy buddy) I like her.  She's nice. (lowering his voice) For her age. 
The bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile. Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door behind her. 
Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT 
The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three a.m. at the Lime House. 
AT THE BACK TABLE 
Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out of place. 
A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them. 
AT THE BAR 
Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might peg him.  Nick is at ease. 
CHARLIE What are they doing now? 
NICK Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked. 
CHARLIE Who do you think the Jap is? 
NICK Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know? 
CHARLIE I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him. 
Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot. 
CHARLIE Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'. Eighty-five bucks. (lowering his voice) Girls go for shoes.  Second place they look. (off Nick's reaction) Hey, I read it in a magazine. 
Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door. 
NICK (dead serious) Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me? 
CHARLIE What? 
WHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight Mafioso. 
NICK Frank Abolofia. 
CHARLIE The Wolf? 
Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests. 
NICK (in a whisper) Some party. 
CHARLIE Maybe we should do something? 
NICK Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm. 
Nick turns away, resumes his drink. 
NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark Versace suits. 
NUMBER ONE 
wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the room then nods to -- 
NUMBER TWO 
who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters. Everyone hits the floor. 
NUMBER ONE 
slowly walks toward Cavello's table. 
NUMBER TWO 
covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty hands. 
NICK AND CHARLIE 
on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy either. 
AT THE TABLE 
Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them contemptuously. 
Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any precipitous action. 
NUMBER ONE (in Japanese) Give it to me. 
The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long, silent pause... Then, still not facing him: 
BUSINESSMAN (in Japanese) Go to hell. 
Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube. 
He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's throat.

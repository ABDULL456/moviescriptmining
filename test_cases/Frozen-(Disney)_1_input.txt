Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) I wouldn't put my foot there. 
ANNA (O.S.) You're distracting me. 
KRISTOFF Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you? 
ANNA (O.S.) I'm just blocking you out cause I gotta concentrate here. 
KRISTOFF You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone. 
ANNA (O.S.) Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you-- 
KRISTOFF I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember? 
Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA You mean the love experts? 
KRISTOFF Yes, the love experts! 
Anna realizes she's stuck. 
ANNA ...Please tell me I'm almost there. 
REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake. 
ANNA (CONT'D) ...Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? 
Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her. 
KRISTOFF Hang on. 
He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to Kristoff. 
OLAF Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go. 
ANNA Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch! 
Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise. 
She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off. Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck. 
EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY 
Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace. 
ANNA Whoa. 
KRISTOFF (in awe) Now that's ice. I might cry. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ANNA Go ahead. I won't judge. 
Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction. Kristoff runs to his aide. 
KRISTOFF All right, take it easy. I gotcha. 
Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) You stay right here, buddy. 
Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details. 
KRISTOFF (CONT'D) ...Flawless. 
Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates. 
OLAF ...Knock.... (she doesn't) Just knock.... (she doesn't. To Kristoff) Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock? 
Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors slide open. 
ANNA Ha. It opened. That's a first. 
Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought, stops him. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You should probably wait out here. 
KRISTOFF What? 
ANNA Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything. 
KRISTOFF But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life. FROZEN - J. Lee 
OLAF Bye, Sven. 
Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.

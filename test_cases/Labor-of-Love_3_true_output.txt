CUT TO: 
A FRIGHTENING FLASH 
The mother's UNCONSCIOUS face turns into ELLEN.  Her lifeless eyes -- her bruised cheek and forehead.  Her neck at an awkward angle.  Maurice stares down at his wife in horror. 
MAURICE No Ellen... don't die... 
CUT TO: 
THE MOTHER 
being revived by Maurice.  He pushes her chest in counting... push, count, breath... push, count, breath... 
The mother's BODY TWITCHES, slightly at first -- then obviously... The mother let's out a FEW PAINFUL COUGHS. 
She takes a breath.  Life quickly returns to her body. Maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her, lightly rocking back and forth.  The tears streaming down his red face. 
MAURICE Everything's going to be fine Ellen.  I won't let anything happen to you.  I love you sweetie. Everything's going to be different now. 
The SCENE BACKS OUT as Maurice comforts this stranger in his arms. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ROAD - AFTERNOON 
The police have descended on the scene.  Traffic has been blocked off in both directions.  The LIGHT thrown by the ambulances tints the snow and fields a THROBBING RED. 
Maurice's face can be seen in the shadows of the backseat of a police car. 
OUTSIDE THE CAR 
OFFICER HANSEN AND OFFICER TANDY converse. 
HANSEN What's his story? 
TANDY His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else. 
HANSEN Red flag, man. 
TANDY If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space. 
Hansen looks in at the drawn, exhausted face of Maurice through the window.  Hansen opens the back door. 
HANSEN Maurice, you need anything?  Which way were you headed?  We can drive you. 
MAURICE No thank you officer.  I'll walk. 
Hansen throws a sharp glance to Tandy.  Hansen turns back to Maurice. 
HANSEN Grub?  Food?  How about food?  Our dime at the local diner... 
Maurice mulls this offer. 
HANSEN Come on man, you're a hero.  In Nebraska we don't let hero's walk around with empty stomachs. 
Beat. 
MAURICE ... I need to be brought back here. 
HANSEN Deal. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DINER - EVENING 
The end of the meal.  Maurice sits in a booth across from Hansen and Tandy.  They watch as Maurice coughs violently into his napkin. 
HANSEN You look like shit Maurice. 
Maurice takes a couple strained breaths. 
MAURICE Getting old. 
TANDY How long have you been footing it Maurice? 
Beat. 
MAURICE Too long... (looks around) Excuse me gentlemen. 
Maurice gets up and heads to the bathroom.  Hansen and Tandy stare at Maurice's shoulder bag laying on his seat. 
HANSEN Red flags man. 
TANDY Not our problem. 
HANSEN Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot. 
TANDY Not our problem. 
HANSEN It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house. 
TANDY This guy's not a murderer. 
HANSEN If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.

INT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME 
Skipper and Alice have paperwork spread out in front of them.  A knock. 
SKIPPER Come. 
Chuck enters, awkward. 
SKIPPER What's on your mind? 
CHUCK I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir. 
Skipper looks up. 
SKIPPER Well, spit it out. 
CHUCK The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance. 
Alice raises her eyebrows, surprised. 
SKIPPER Can't do it. 
CHUCK Sir...? 
SKIPPER Close the door.  Sit down. 
Chuck does as he is told. 
SKIPPER Why do you think I'm sending him home? 
CHUCK He killed the dolphin. 
Skipper looks at Chuck for a moment. 
SKIPPER The Dolphin was a symptom. 
CHUCK Of what? 
SKIPPER Of a fight he can't win out here. 
CHUCK It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it... 
Suddenly it's as if Chuck is talking about his own life. 
CHUCK I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here? 
SKIPPER They have every right Chuck. 
CHUCK They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same. 
Skipper sits up and studies Chuck for a moment. 
SKIPPER Let me tell you something about Phil's father, and your's too.  How do you think you got here?  You think this is all free, that they owe you something?  You think they enjoy riding subways and commuter trains, driving buses or pulling lobster traps?  Work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school?  Look around at how the rest of the world lives Chuck. We're the luckiest people alive, every one of us.  They gave it up for you and Phil, and me too my friend. 
Chuck chews on it. 
SKIPPER There are ground rules in families just like on this boat.  If you and Phil don't like it, I'm sorry. Someday you'll understand that, and if you're lucky, you'll come home and find your best friend has been there all along waiting for you to forgive him for being a father. It'll be the way it used to be, when you were ten and your dad was a giant. 
Now it's Skipper who is talking about himself. 
SKIPPER Does Phil know how you guys feel? 
CHUCK I don't know. 
SKIPPER You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him. 
Chuck nods and leaves. 
EXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME 
As Chuck exits he meets Robin's eyes.  He shakes his head. 
INT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME 
Skipper returns to his paperwork but can feel Alice watching him.  He senses it. 
SKIPPER I'm all ears. 
Alice smiles. 
ALICE You may not like what you hear. 
SKIPPER I can take it. 
ALICE They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came. 
Skipper puts a loving hand on Alice's shoulder. 
SKIPPER Why did we begin this? 
ALICE We were idealists. 
SKIPPER Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing. 
ALICE I haven't forgotten. 
SKIPPER Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world. 
ALICE He has a lot of hurt inside him.

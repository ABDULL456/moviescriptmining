MICHAEL All right. I'm not very good. 
MICHAEL grins, embarrassed, then opens the book. 
MICHAEL Act One. Scene One. The setting : one of the prince's chambers. Prince - "Complaints, nothing but complaints, petitions, nothing but petitions. For goodness' sake, just imagine that people actually envy us." 
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT 
Later. They are in the bath together. HANNA takes a piece of soap and runs it lovingly down his cheek. Then she passes the soap across his stomach. 
HANNA You're good at it, aren't you? 
MICHAEL Good at what? 
HANNA Reading. 
He smiles. 
HANNA Why are you smiling? 
MICHAEL Because I didn't think I was good at anything. 
INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY 
MICHAEL is playing handball with terrific physical confidence. A couple of bruising physical encounters. HOLGER, RUDOLF and MICHAEL all laugh. The whistle blows. Game over. 
EXT. TRAM. DAWN 
An empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets. MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on. 
INT. TRAM. DAWN 
MICHAEL is sitting in the second carriage. He looks up. The CONDUCTRESS is HANNA. At first, she does not notice him. MICHAEL watches, waiting to be noticed. She turns round and looks at him. He smiles in greeting but she makes no acknowledgement at all. She turns away. He frowns, bewildered. 
EXT. TRAM. DAY 
The tram is heading out of town. 
INT. TRAM. DAY 
HANNA is now talking animatedly to the DRIVER. They are getting on very well, laughing together and chatting. MICHAEL is still by himself in the second carriage, looking foolish. 
EXT. TRAM. DAY 
The tram comes to a halt and PASSENGERS get on. 
INT. TRAM. DAY 
HANNA is now in the busy second carriage, collecting tickets. MICHAEL looks up expectantly. But as he holds up his ticket, HANNA makes no reaction except to clip it. She turns away without speaking. The tram comes to a halt again, and MICHAEL, humiliated, bolts for the door. 
EXT. ROAD. DAY 
MICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks around, lost, in the middle of nowhere. A tractor goes by, WORKERS heading to the fields. MICHAEL sets off to walk back to town. 
INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
MICHAEL is on the stairs as HANNA comes up, in her uniform. 
MICHAEL What was all that about?

ARCHER Listen to my voice, Jamie.  I'm your father. 
CASTOR It's a trick, Jamie.  I'm your father. 
Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled. 
CASTOR Shoot him, Jamie. 
ARCHER Jamie... 
CASTOR Shoot him! 
Jamie FIRES.  Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his shoulder.  Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand. 
CASTOR You dunce.  No kid of mine would miss so badly. 
He aims the gun at Archer's head. 
WANDA (O.S.) Hold it. 
Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns leveled.  Eve and more agents are right behind. 
CASTOR Just saving the taxpayers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike. 
WANDA You're both under arrest until a D.N.A. test proves who's who. 
CASTOR I'm ordering you to back off! 
Several agents waver -- unsure.  But not Wanda and Buzz. 
WANDA Put the gun down -- 
BUZZ -- Now! 
CASTOR (beat) Can't blame me for trying. 
He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her chin. 
Archer struggles to his feet as -- 
Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate to the garden.  Archer follows -- cautiously. 
CASTOR Say goodbye to Daddy -- 
Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's thigh and twists.  She dives away.  FIRING wildly, Castor staggers back through the gate. 
CASTOR (O.S.) You ungrateful delinquent! 
OUTSIDE GATE 
As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a confused security agent. 
CASTOR Give me your weapon -- now! 
The agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him. 
BOATYARD 
Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay. 
JAMIE (to Archer) Who are you?  Will someone please tell me what's going on? 
Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open. 
CASTOR 
limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive with sunbathers and yachters. 
EXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY 
Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking for -- 
Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by their suntanned crews.  He jumps into one of the boats. 
BOAT CAPTAIN Hey -- ! 
Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead.  In a flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT.  He sees -- 
CASTOR'S POV 
Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat. 
CASTOR 
FIRES -- peppering the dock. 
Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him.  Archer rolls into the boat -- FIRING. 
Castor's hit!  A slug grazes his shoulder.  He grabs the THROTTLE -- taking off.

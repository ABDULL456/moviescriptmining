Am I paranoid or something? I mean, why is this happening? The government is after me... the state is after me... Mr. Marengay ... somebody is always after me. What the hell's going on here? I'm just this guy. What's the big deal? They can't get along without me? The government can't operate unless they've got Tilley's money... the Commission's after my job! This shit's driving me insane! All the lying, thieving, stealing corporations in this world, and the IRS takes the time to come for me? There's billions of dollars out there but they've got to come and get Tilley's four thousand dollars! (turning to Mouse) Turn off the fucking Belafonte song now, or I'm gonna break the goddamn machine!!

105   CONTINUED:                                              105 BB I'm more than sure. Ruthie moves off. BB takes a shot of whiskey and downs it, and then drinks some beer. STANLEY Who was the best you ever saw? BB Best I ever saw?   Best tin man I ever saw? He holds up his shot glass towards the bartender, and the bartender fills it up. 
BB Harry Apel... Dandy Flynn... those guys had good lines, but they burned themselves out too fast. Best? Moe's the best... the best there ever was. If he's in the door, he's got a sale. The best closer ever. STANLEY What's some of the hustles he used to pull? BB downs another shot glass of whisky. BB God damn Nora... God damn Nora! I'm trying to adjust... I'm putting up with things I never put up with in my life. I mean, give me a break... give me a break, woman. Stanely wants to get back to the topic of best tin man. STANLEY (making light) So, what are a couple of things you and Moe have done? BB (still on the subject of Nora) It was getting to be real pleasant ... figure that. (long beat) More than pleasant. To hell with her! (CONTINUED)

BB holds out his glass again to the bartender who refills it. BB downs the shot and drinks more beer. BB I don't know why they're so irrational... chicks. I dunno. I think it's because air gets inside 'em. (beat) She probably went back home, to her husband. (looks at his watch) Eleven-thirty... he wouldn't be home yet. (takes out a $10 bill from his wallet) This outght to cover it, Stanley. He puts the $10 bill down on the bar and walks out of the club. CUT TO:

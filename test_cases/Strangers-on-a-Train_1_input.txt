EXT. UNION STATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. DAY LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA 
Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera. 
We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues. 
INT. STATION LOBBY 
CAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the lobby into a passenger tunnel. There is the usual activity of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing trains, etc.

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues. 
MAN'S VOICE (over scene) Oh, excuse Me! 
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely, acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy. 
BRUNO (smiling with sudden recognition) I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines. 
Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before. 
BRUNO (snapping his finger) Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you? 
Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist. 
BRUNO (with open admiration) I certainly admire people who do things. (smiling and introducing himself) I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.

GUY (patiently)(a faint smile) How do you do. 
BRUNO (with an apologetic grin) I don't usually talk so much.   Go Ahead and read. 
GUY (wryly) Thanks. Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open appraisal. 
BRUNO It must be pretty exciting to be so important. 
GUY (fidgeting slightly) A tennis player isn't so important. 
BRUNO People who do things are important. I never seem to do anything. 
Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little embarrassed. 
BRUNO (still insistent on being friendly) I suppose you're going to Southampton -- for the doubles. 
GUY (politely) You are a tennis fan. 
Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute. 
BRUNO Wish I could see you play. But I've got to be back in Washington tomorrow. I live in Arlington, you know. 
He has taken out a cigarette case.   Holds it out to Guy.

BRUNO Cigarette? 
GUY Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much. 
BRUNO I smoke too much. 
He fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and hands it to Bruno. 
BRUNO Thanks. (he stares at the lighter, impressed) Elegant.

CHERYL (CONT'D) Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me? 
MARK I was terrified. 
CHERYL You can be proud of yourself. You did great. We've made real progress. 
MARK Can I ask you something? 
CHERYL Of course. What would you like to ask? 
MARK Anything, really. Tell me something about yourself. Anything. 
CHERYL Sure. I'm a very private person. I have a private life, I do need you to be aware of that, but that's about it. This therapy is about you. 
There is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key turns in the lock. A few moments later, Carmen and Vera come in. 
MARK Welcome back. 
CHERYL Perfect timing. 
CARMEN I hope you guys kept the noise down. 
EXT.   STREET NEAR CARMEN'S.   DAY Vera wheels Mark back the way they came. She is very discreet and they travel in silence for a while. Finally, curiosity overcomes her. 
VERA How do you feel? 
MARK Cleansed and victorious. 
VERA Doesn't get any better than that. 
MARK Tell me about your first sexual experience. 
VERA Let me think. It wasn't all that pleasant. I mean, it was consensual and everything, and I really was in love with the guy, but his dick seemed enormous to me, I didn't think it would fit. It was scary. But he was nice. I guess he couldn't help it. 
MARK Was he Chinese? 
VERA Are you kidding? I only hung out with white guys at high school. 
MARK Why is that? 
VERA I don't know. To stick it to my mum and dad, I suppose. 
MARK Are they happy now you've got a Chinese boyfriend? 
VERA They're happy. I'm happy. 
MARK What's his dick like? 
VERA Perfect size. 
MARK Why do you call it a dick instead of a penis? 
VERA Penis sounds like some vegetable you don't want to eat. Dick sounds like what it is. 
They continue in silence for a little while. 
MARK The thing is, it was all over so damn quickly. 
VERA Yes, tell me about it.

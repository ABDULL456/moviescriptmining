Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 42. 
CONTINUED: At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer scrutiny one can read Meg's composed discomfort in wearing a dress that is too tight, nearly spilling her breasts, and the self-consciousness Alice endures in a dress made daringly short by her height. But, this is because we know them; to all other eyes they not only belong here, they own the room. They glance at one another, eyebrows up: "We're here!" 
EMMA Don't you feel like we've won something already? Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA SILVANO (30's, movie-star handsome), both in tuxedos, offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps. 
JEAN-PIERRE Mademoiselle Scott, you made it! Emma withholds her natural smile, placing just the tips of her fingers in Jean-Pierre's palm with exaggerated hauteur. 
EMMA Enchante. Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place with a hand as she steps down. 
JEAN-PIERRE And Mademoiselle Margaret Kelly and Mademoiselle Alice Perry-- 
(FOR ALICE) I am very glad you were able to come this evening. Alice nods, blushes and tries to cover. 
JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D) May I present His Highness, Prince Domenico Da Silvano? Prince Da Silvano bows from the waist. 
DOMENICO 
MADEMOISELLE SCOTT-- 
EMMA Please, call me "Cordelia."

CONTINUED: (2) 
DOMENICO If you will call me "Domenico." 
EMMA I shall certainly try. Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean- Pierre touches Alice's elbow. 
JEAN-PIERRE Shall we? Alice and Meg allow Jean-Pierre to lead them, following Emma as GAMBLERS break from their games to track these three elegant women gliding smoothly through the room. 
MEG (aside to Alice) I may as well be topless. 
ALICE Please. I'm mooning everyone behind us. 
INT. LES CASINO - PRIVATE GAME ROOM - NIGHT 
A DEALER unseals a new deck of cards as Domenico pulls out a chair for Emma at the room's enormous game table. 
EMMA Oh, but, I really wasn't planning on playing this evening. I so much prefer to watch-- Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads them to the far side of a low railing to view the game. 
DOMENICO 
(A WINK) This I do not believe about you. He turns to the eight other PLAYERS (of various ages and genders, but all rich) clustered at the room's small bar. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) Ladies and gentlemen? Shall we begin? The other players make obligatory introductions and take up positions at the table as Jean-Pierre offers Alice and Meg tall upholstered stools to sit. 
(CONTINUED) 
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 44. 
CONTINUED: Alice moves to sit, but then remembers her skirt, looks to Meg who is unable to even raise a leg in her tight dress. 
ALICE 
(TO JEAN-PIERRE) Easier to see if we stand. Jean-Pierre hands them both a glass of Champagne. 
ALICE (CONT'D) And why aren't you playing? 
JEAN-PIERRE Ah. I play behind the scenes. Like Robin Hood, I take from those who have more than enough, for those who have nothing but need. 
(LAUGHS) Also, I do not play because I have no money of my own. Alice smiles, charmed by his candor, but then stops. 
ALICE They're playing for money? (turns to Meg, flat) 
IS They're playing for money. Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards she is dealt in her hands. 
DOMENICO Cordelia, why don't you do us the honor of setting this evening's stakes? Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her, ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly. 
EMMA Oh. Um. Okay... She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks. 
EMMA (CONT'D) 
(A GUESS) Alright. Why don't... Why don't we start at ten? A shocked player sputters into his drink. Emma places a twenty Euro note on the table. 
(CONTINUED) 
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 45. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
EMMA (CONT'D) That is if anyone is able to make change. A beat. Jean-Pierre, Domenico and all the other players burst out laughing and Emma smiles, laughing too, but shoots a desperate look to Alice and Meg. 
DOMENICO Marvelous! He signals an ATTENDANT over as Emma's shoulders relax. 
DOMENICO (CONT'D) Please bring Mademoiselle Scott a rack of chips. 
(TO EMMA) Two hundred? 
EMMA 
(BIG GULP) Um. Sure. 
JEAN-PIERRE You would not know it, but she is very funny.

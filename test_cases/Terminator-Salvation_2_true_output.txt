STAR Music... 
MARCUS Sort of. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.       He looks up to see-- 
--THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING. 
KYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT-- 
THE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows. 
STAR Oh no! It's gonna call a Harvester, we're dead-- 
MARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet ahead of them, hovering in the air. 
MARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat, rises, taking aim-- 
--and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power-- 
--it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL. 
The three of them stare breathlessly for a moment. 
KYLE Wow.   You're good. 
MARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.   TEXAS PLAINS - NIGHT 
The JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic. 
ANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle. 
STAR Faster! 
MARCUS No!    You're doing fine. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it. 
MARCUS (cont'd) Ssh. 
MARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear, rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a relatively CLEAR VOICE: 
RADIO VOICE --proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel. A bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag, and will detonate on impact... 
KYLE (EXCITED) That's him! 
RADIO VOICE This recording has described booby- traps and explosive devices. It will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid Skynet jamming... 
STAR points toward the horizon.    Marcus looks up. 
MARCUS Stop the car. 
KYLE ACCELERATES. 
MARCUS (cont'd) Other pedal, other pedal! 
They SCREECH to a halt. 
IN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider- like MACHINES are just visible. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RADIO VOICE Do not give in to despair. As bleak as things seem, I assure you, humanity will triumph. 
HIGH ANGLE - THE JEEP turns away from the conflagration, moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness. 
RADIO VOICE (cont'd) The machines only win when we give up hope... this is John Connor. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN 
HIGH ANGLE - a crumbling SERVICE STATION with a RUSTING TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.   MOVE TO FIND the JEEP approaching off-road. 
THE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance.
